Ron DeSantis, whose bid for president ended following a distant second place finish in Iowa, will join thousands of Republicans when they gather next week in Milwaukee.\n\nJust don't expect to see him up on stage at the Republican National Convention.\n\nDeSantis, once seen as a rising conservative star, is not scheduled to have a main stage speaking slot during the week-long celebration of former President Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with convention plans but not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBut the GOP governor will participate in other Republican events occurring in conjunction with the convention that could keep him somewhat in the spotlight -- and in the minds of the party faithful. A spokesperson for DeSantis' political operation declined to comment.\n\nHe's appearing at a town hall hosted by Moms for Liberty and is set to appear at the \"Southern States Fest\" being held at the Milwaukee Brewers' stadium that will feature other GOP governors from the region.\n\nDeSantis will also be the main speaker at a breakfast meeting hosted by the Republican Party of Florida. DeSantis is also allowed to be on the convention floor. Evan Power, the chair of the Republican Party of Florida, said that sitting governors and members of Congress are given floor passes.\n\nDeSantis rose to Florida's governorship with key backing from Trump in 2018, but his decision to challenge his onetime ally was framed as an act of betrayal by the former president. Trump and his team unleashed a furious response to DeSantis, who would eventually ratchet up his criticism of the former president. Several top aides to Trump previously worked with DeSantis and do not have a good relationship with him.\n\nCNN first reported that DeSantis was not scheduled to speak.\n\nAfter he dropped out in January, DeSantis endorsed Trump. But the two did not attempt a rapprochement until months later when they held a private meeting at a South Florida golf course. It was in that meeting that DeSantis pledged to raise money for Trump's reelection effort. One person familiar with the conversation said that DeSantis did not ask Trump for a speaking slot at the convention nor to be considered for a position in a potential Trump administration.\n\nDeSantis has said several times publicly that he did not anticipate doing a lot of campaigning for Trump this election year because he does not expect Florida to be in play for Democrats. DeSantis, for example, was not present at Trump's rally held Tuesday in Doral even though many other Florida Republicans were there, including the state's two senators.\n\nDeSantis is viewed by many in his orbit as a likely 2028 presidential contender. But that positioning could be undermined by Trump's vice presidential pick, especially if Trump selects another Florida Republican, like Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nFew convention speakers have been rolled out ahead of next week's nominating process. Another 2024 primary rival, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, will also not be speaking -- and was not invited to the convention at all, POLITICO previously reported.\n\n\"She's fine with that,\" Haley spokesperson Chaney Denton told POLITICO. \"Trump deserves the convention he wants. She's made it clear she's voting for him and wishes him the best.\"\n\nHaley has released her delegates and encouraged them to vote for Trump next week.\n\nOne governor who will be speaking is West Virginia's Jim Justice. The party's Senate nominee -- and likely winner in November -- is scheduled to speak Tuesday night at the RNC about his race, his vision for West Virginia and Trump's impact on the state, according to a person familiar the convention plans, as part of a Senate candidate power hour.\n\nBut Justice, of course, won't be alone. Also joining him on stage will be his canine sidekick, the 62-pound English bulldog, Babydog.

Ron DeSantis is now planning to address former President Donald Trump's nominating convention next week, an apparent reversal from just one day earlier when he was expected not to give a speech.\n\nDeSantis' speaking role at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was confirmed Wednesday by a person familiar with the schedule, which has not yet been released.\n\nOnce allies turned rivals during this year's Republican primary, Trump and DeSantis have tried to achieve a d\u00e9tente that benefits both of them. But there are lingering tensions between their camps -- and long memories in Trump's orbit about the hazards of elevating a former primary opponent to the convention stage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who ran against Trump in a similarly bitter GOP race eight years ago, famously gave a speech at the 2016 Republican convention in which he declined to endorse Trump by name and instead told voters to follow their consciences. Cruz exited the stage to a chorus of boos.\n\nBut DeSantis quickly endorsed Trump by name after finishing a distant second to him in Iowa. DeSantis aides said they had repeatedly been advised that he would have a speaking role and had no reason to believe he wouldn't, though they were unable to confirm a speaking slot Wednesday.\n\nNBC News first reported DeSantis would be on the RNC schedule.\n\nDeSantis was already planning to be in Milwaukee during the convention, and was planning to headline a Moms for Liberty town hall event and is scheduled to appear with fellow governors at the \"Southern States Fest\" at American Family Field.\n\nSince February, Trump has taken control of all aspects of the Republican National Committee and the convention, installing his top lieutenants in party leadership, rewriting the party platform and closely scrutinizing who will speak.\n\nAllowing DeSantis a speaking spot demonstrates how far the two have come since last year when Trump mocked his challenger as \"DeSanctimonious\" and the Florida governor campaigned against the former president as not having delivered on key priorities.\n\nDeSantis has headlined fundraisers in Fort Lauderdale and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for Trump's candidacy, and is scheduling September events in Texas.\n\nTrump phoned into the Fort Lauderdale event in May, when DeSantis and his top fundraisers spent the day reaching out to his top donors, praising DeSantis, saying \"Ron, I love that you're back,\" according to people present.\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who remained in the race against Trump into March, was not invited to speak in Milwaukee, though she has said she will vote for Trump and has moved to release delegates she won to support Trump at the convention.\n\nIn a radio interview Wednesday morning, Trump made a distinction between his two former rivals.\n\n\"You know, there was a lot of bad blood there,\" he said of Haley, his former U.N. Ambassador. \"She stayed too long. She was being soundly defeated at every place, but she just wouldn't leave.\"\n\nDeSantis, on the other hand, ended his campaign and endorsed Trump shortly after losing his first primary.\n\n\"He left after Iowa because he said there was no way he could win,\" he said on Fox News Radio.\n\nHe also dismissed the idea that reconciling with Haley could help him win over the moderate voters. Some continued to back her even after she had ended her candidacy.\n\n\"No. They're not going to vote for Biden,\" he said. \"They're going to vote for Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00e9tente", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D\u00e9tente"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Family Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson Hole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/desantis_trump_legal_defense_bill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719927", "eventUri": "eng-9719927", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

Ron DeSantis is now planning to address former President Donald Trump's nominating convention next week, an apparent reversal from just one day earlier when he was expected not to give a speech.\n\nDeSantis' speaking role at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was confirmed Wednesday by a person familiar with the schedule who spoke on condition of anonymity because the schedule has not yet been released.\n\nOnce allies turned rivals during this year's Republican primary, Trump and DeSantis have tried to achieve a d\u00e9tente that benefits both of them. But there are lingering tensions between their camps -- and long memories in Trump's orbit about the hazards of elevating a former primary opponent to the convention stage.\n\nU.S. Sen.

Ron DeSantis (R) will speak during next week's Republican National Convention, a source familiar with the plans confirmed, after initial uncertainty whether he would be given a slot.\n\nThe source did not say which day DeSantis would give remarks. The convention will run next Monday through Thursday. A lineup of speakers is expected to be released in the coming days.\n\nNBC News first reported that DeSantis would speak at the convention, and the outlet cited a source close to the governor who said they had never been told he would not be speaking at the event in Milwaukee.\n\n\"We have been told for a while we had a speaking slot and have never been told we do not,\" the source told NBC.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who won the most delegates other than former President Trump during the GOP primary, will not be in attendance for the convention but has urged her delegates to back the former president.\n\nDeSantis was largely viewed as Trump's top rival heading into the 2024 primary, but the Florida governor struggled to gain traction with voters and suspended his campaign after finishing in second place in Iowa.\n\nTrump and DeSantis were bitter rivals during the primary; the former president repeatedly attacked the Florida governor on his personality and policy until DeSantis suspended his campaign after the Iowa caucuses.\n\nTrump often referred to the governor as \"DeSanctimonious\" and complained that DeSantis had not been adequately appreciative of his endorsement during the 2018 Florida gubernatorial race. On policy, Trump accused DeSantis of copying his ideas.\n\nDeSantis had avoided directly attacking Trump in the early months of his presidential bid, but by the end of his campaign the Florida governor was telling supporters Trump had \"lost the zip on his fastball\" and was not the same candidate who united the party in 2016 and 2020.\n\nWhile DeSantis endorsed Trump upon suspending his campaign in January, the sniping did not stop. After DeSantis reportedly aired grievances about Trump on a call with supporters, top Trump aide Chris LaCivita responded that DeSantis was a \"sad little man.\"\n\nThe two men met in person in April. While Trump likely does not need DeSantis's help to win the state of Florida in November, the governor has a strong base of donors and supporters who could help the former president as he takes on President Biden, and DeSantis may have his eye on 2028.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_samuels@thehill.com", "name": "Brett Samuels", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa caucuses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/AP24036645915246-e1715874651602.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719927", "eventUri": "eng-9719927", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

DeSantis endorsed Trump and has pledged to help his campaign.\n\nYet neither will be speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. Haley won't be attending the convention. A spokesman for the former South Carolina governor said she wasn't invited.\n\nDeSantis will be in Milwaukee, but only on the periphery of the convention. The two-term Florida governor is scheduled to participate in a Moms for Liberty panel discussion and a breakfast with his state delegation . But a source familiar with the planning said DeSantis won't have a spot on the convention stage during the four-day affair.\n\nShowcasing future talent and promoting party unity typically are key elements of political conventions.\n\nBoth Haley and DeSantis are potential presidential candidates in 2028 and beyond, and there have been questions about whether Haley supporters, who tend to be more moderate, will back Trump in the general election.\n\nThat neither will have a speaking role may be a sign that Trump feels he's in a strong position within the GOP and doesn't need to worry about unifying the party. It also could be a sign of lingering tensions between Trump and his primary rivals. Trump framed both DeSantis' and Haley's presidential campaigns as acts of betrayal.\n\nTrump's endorsement propelled DeSantis to the governorship in 2018, and the former president said it was disloyal to challenge him in the primary. Haley served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. DeSantis challenged Trump from the right, while Haley targeted GOP voters at the other end of the spectrum. Neither collected many delegates.\n\nDeSantis didn't win any contests, dropping out after coming in second to Trump in Iowa, the first state to vote. Haley won primaries in Vermont and the District of Columbia. Yet Haley continued to collect a substantial share of the GOP primary vote after dropping out of the race.\n\nThose protest votes against Trump raised questions about his strength within the party, but such concerns have faded and become more of an issue for Democrats after President Joe Biden's poor debate performance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis denied speaking roles at RNC 2024", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zac_anderson@aol.com", "name": "Zac Anderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moms_for_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moms for Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of ambassadors of the United States to the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/aolfp/metadata/og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719927", "eventUri": "eng-9719927", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 104, "textEnd": 111}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The couple has given more than $600,000 so far this election cycle, half of which has gone to the Republican National Committee. Peter gave another $100,000 to the Trump 47 Committee, Inc., a joint fundraising committee that has helped pay Trump's legal bills.\n\nDeSantis is also planning a September fundraiser in Texas to help, but there are not yet details available for the event. The money DeSantis raises for Trump will go to pro-Trump super PAC Right for America.\n\nThere is still no speaking slot for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was the final Republican to drop out of the GOP primary. She and Trump ran a bruising primary against each other, and when she got out of the primary said she would not \"kiss the ring.\"\n\nBut in May she confirmed she would be voting for Trump, and on Tuesday, Haley released her 97 delegates so they could support Trump at the convention.\n\nThat release, however, has not yet resulted in a role for her at the convention.\n\n\"No Haley as of now,\" the source helping plan convention activities said.\n\nChaney Denton, a longtime senior aide to Haley, confirmed to NBC News that Haley \"was not invited\" to the convention and \"she's fine with that.\"\n\n\"Trump deserves the convention he wants,\" Denton said. \"She's made it clear she's voting for him and wishes him the best.\"\n\nIn 2016, Texas Sen.

Ron DeSantis is now planning to address former President Donald Trump's nominating convention next week, an apparent reversal from just one day earlier when he was expected not to give a speech.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is now planning to address former President Donald Trump's nominating convention next week, an apparent reversal from just one day earlier when he was expected not to give a speech.\n\nDeSantis' speaking role at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was confirmed Wednesday by a person familiar with the schedule who spoke on condition of anonymity because the schedule has not yet been released.\n\nOnce allies turned rivals during this year's Republican primary, Trump and DeSantis have tried to achieve a d\u00e9tente that benefits both of them. But there are lingering tensions between their camps -- and long memories in Trump's orbit about the hazards of elevating a former primary opponent to the convention stage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who ran against Trump in a similarly bitter GOP race eight years ago, famously gave a speech at the 2016 Republican convention in which he declined to endorse Trump by name and instead told voters to follow their consciences. Cruz exited the stage to a chorus of boos.\n\nBut DeSantis quickly endorsed Trump by name after finishing a distant second to him in Iowa. DeSantis aides said they had repeatedly been advised that he would have a speaking role and had no reason to believe he wouldn't, though they were unable to confirm a speaking slot Wednesday.\n\nNBC News first reported DeSantis would be on the RNC schedule.\n\nDeSantis was already planning to be in Milwaukee during the convention, and was planning to headline a Moms for Liberty town hall event and is scheduled to appear with fellow governors at the ''Southern States Fest'' at American Family Field.\n\nSince February, Trump has taken control of all aspects of the Republican National Committee and the convention, installing his top lieutenants in party leadership, rewriting the party platform and closely scrutinizing who will speak.\n\nAllowing DeSantis a speaking spot demonstrates how far the two have come since last year when Trump mocked his challenger as ''DeSanctimonious\" and the Florida governor campaigned against the former president as not having delivered on key priorities.\n\nDeSantis has headlined fundraisers in Fort Lauderdale and Jackson Hole, Wyoming, for Trump's candidacy, and is scheduling September events in Texas.\n\nTrump phoned into the Fort Lauderdale event in May, when DeSantis and his top fundraisers spent the day reaching out to his top donors, praising DeSantis, saying ''Ron, I love that you're back,'' according to people present.\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who remained in the race against Trump into March, was not invited to speak in Milwaukee, though she has said she will vote for Trump and has moved to release delegates she won to support Trump at the convention.\n\nIn a radio interview Wednesday morning, Trump made a distinction between his two former rivals.\n\n''You know, there was a lot of bad blood there,'' he said of Haley, his former U.N. Ambassador. ''She stayed too long. She was being soundly defeated at every place, but she just wouldn't leave.''\n\nDeSantis, on the other hand, ended his campaign and endorsed Trump shortly after losing his first primary.\n\n''He left after Iowa because he said there was no way he could win,'' he said on Fox News Radio.\n\nHe also dismissed the idea that reconciling with Haley could help him win over the moderate voters. Some continued to back her even after she had ended her candidacy.\n\n''No. They're not going to vote for Biden,'' he said. ''They're going to vote for Trump.''\n\nAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York contributed to this report.

Some in Trump's circle and the former president saw his bid for the presidency as an act of betrayal, and the two sparred throughout the primary.\n\nThe former president branded the Florida governor as Ron \"DeSanctimonious\" and other highly personal terms. Still, DeSantis spent most of his campaign careful about hitting Trump back as he sought the GOP nomination.\n\nDeSantis ultimately withdrew from the primary after losing the Iowa Caucus to Trump in January. Before his presidential bid plateaued, DeSantis was seen as a prolific fundraiser and popular governor who seemed positioned to try to take the GOP into a post-Trump era.\n\nBefore the Wednesday change, neither DeSantis nor Nikki Haley, the two of the top three vote-getters in the Republican presidential primary, were slated to speak at the RNC.

J.D. Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum but ahead of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is making a late surge with investors who see him putting his purple state in play.\n\nRubio will be at the event, of course. And assuming he's Trump's pick, that will leave another Florida man with a big decision.\n\nIn that case, Gov. Ron DeSantis would be charged with replacing Rubio in the Senate, per the Constitution's 17th Amendment, until a special election.\n\nFor DeSantis, that opportunity only presents upsides, should the former president provide it to him.\n\nOne wrinkle of Florida politics: The governor doesn't exactly dialogue with Sunshine State senators.\n\nThere are good reasons for some of this -- DeSantis wasn't thrilled with how then-Gov. Rick Scott left office.\n\nScott memorably delayed entering the Senate in 2019 to milk his tenure to the very last moment, with a party in the governor's mansion hours before DeSantis' inauguration -- and after Florida's new first family had moved in. Adding insult to injury, Scott later left DeSantis' inauguration early, presumably to beat the crowds.\n\nScott has shared his own complaints, to this day noting on numerous occasions that DeSantis never reached out to him in the wake of state-level crises.\n\nIt's not quite as bad with Rubio. Yet the senator has mentioned that months have passed between conversations with DeSantis. There's no reason to think they're talking much now either.\n\nThat means if Rubio is Trump's pick, DeSantis has an opportunity to install someone he trusts and works well with in the role.\n\nPossibilities abound -- including inside the governor's mansion.\n\nCasey DeSantis is telegenic, ambitious and involved in policy -- seeming in some ways a prime choice for her husband.\n\nA former TV newscaster, Florida's first lady would be able to parlay that experience into a national platform. And she's clearly attuned to what the governor wants -- as those who saw his presidential campaign know, there was a \"two for the price of one\" vibe to their presentation not unlike that of Bill and Hillary Clinton decades ago.\n\nThe problem with that pick is not political but personal. The DeSantis family has three school-aged children, and Mrs. DeSantis is a very active and involved mother, so it's hard to imagine her wanting to move to Washington.\n\nOther options could be in play, including Attorney General Ashley Moody and Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nunez. Both have shown unstinting loyalty to DeSantis and his agenda, and both are thought to be gunning for the governor's seat in 2026.\n\nSelecting Moody or Nunez would narrow down the governor's race to succeed him, creating a Casey-sized lane in a race where polls say Republicans prefer her to any other potential candidate and outlets like National Review are already excited about her succeeding her husband.\n\nOther people who have been less loyal to DeSantis -- Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis and Ag Commish Wilton Simpson, along with the congressional delegation, most of whom endorsed Trump when DeSantis was still in the race -- are probably out of the mix.\n\nThat's no surprise since the ultimate benefit for the governor would be having a senator he could work with.\n\nTo that end, there are also some potential wildcards, like former Florida House Speaker Jos\u00e9 Oliva -- he worked for DeSantis' presidential campaign helping with Hispanic outreach.\n\nAnother name to look out: The governor's chief of staff, James Uthmeier, who helmed DeSantis' presidential campaign before returning to the governor's office.\n\nUthmeier has had political ambitions of his own for some time, and an insider pick like that would be similar to former Gov. Charlie Crist's selection of George LeMieux -- his former chief of staff who also helped Crist's campaign side throughout his career.\n\nDeSantis has been a untraditional, transformative governor in many ways. But given the chance to make his mark on the Senate, he's likely to choose continuity and predictability over a wildcard maverick.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susie Wiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Youngkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Youngkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

DeSantis endorsed Trump and has pledged to help his campaign.\n\nYet neither will be speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. Haley won't be attending the convention.

It also could be a sign of lingering tensions between Trump and his primary rivals. Trump framed both DeSantis' and Haley's presidential campaigns as acts of betrayal.\n\nTrump's endorsement propelled DeSantis to the governorship in 2018, and the former president said it was disloyal to challenge him in the primary. Haley served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. DeSantis challenged Trump from the right, while Haley targeted GOP voters at the other end of the spectrum. Neither collected many delegates.\n\nDeSantis didn't win any contests, dropping out after coming in second to Trump in Iowa, the first state to vote. Haley won primaries in Vermont and the District of Columbia.

If DeSantis can't turn those numbers around and get voters to side with him, it will prove an significant setback heading into his final two years as governor.\n\nDuring bill signings and other recent official stops, DeSantis has gone off topic to run down the proposals.\n\n\"The governor's effort is all about persuasion, stopping at nothing. This is how Madison Avenue works,\" said Aubrey Jewett, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida who's monitored Florida ballot amendments for the past three decades.\n\n\"You don't have to persuade everybody. But there are plenty of people who haven't really made up their minds. They don't follow politics. And if (DeSantis) says something enough times, maybe they'll listen to him,\" he said.\n\nHis Freedom Fund, launched last month, has raised only $121,400 through the end of June, $100,000 of it coming from a Central Florida company, POB Ventures, which appears to be a marijuana-related organization.\n\nPat O'Brien, the company's authorized representative in documents filed with the state, did not immediately return phone calls or texts with questions about the contribution.\n\nDeSantis fund-raising is slow but both sides expect spike\n\nStill, the governor's allies and those promoting the ballot measures say they expect DeSantis to raise enough cash to mount a vigorous opposition campaign by the time voters become more engaged in the fall.\n\nThe Florida Republican Party also has come out against the two ballot proposals, a move sure to help the governor in dollars and messaging.\n\nMeanwhile, Amendments 3 and 4 have massive volumes of cash for their own voter persuasion.\n\nThe abortion rights Amendment 4, had about $15.6 million on hand last month. Amendment 3 had $13.1 million, powered by Quincy-based Trulieve, the medical marijuana company that contributed most of the $60 million raised so far, with much of that spent on the petition campaign that positioned it for the ballot.\n\nOrganizers of the amendment campaigns point to the popularity of the measures, not the vast amount of money that will help drive their message to Floridians. But as proof of their robust finances, Amendment 3 has already begun airing TV spots.\n\nMore: John Morgan, Florida's 'Pot Daddy,' now the voice of recreational marijuana ad campaign\n\nAlthough still early for massive media blitzes, both sides in the two ballot fights are likely to prove a steady presence on TV and social media platforms by fall.\n\n\"The governor shouldn't take for granted Florida voters, including the 57% in his own party who are supportive of Amendment 3,\" said Morgan Hill, spokeswoman for Smart & Safe Florida, citing findings of the recent Fox News poll.\n\n\"They know better than to believe these scare tactics that haven't been a problem in more than half the country that has already legalized recreational use,\" she added.\n\n'Scare tactics' intended to spook voters\n\nNatasha Sutherland, with the Yes on 4 campaign, also said that the governor's \"mistruths and disinformation\" will be countered by proponents.\n\n\"His approach indicates that he knows that Floridians are with us on this issue, and he's really grasping at straws,\" Sutherland said.\n\nAlthough 84,000 abortions were performed last year in Florida, among the highest totals in the nation, Florida's six-week law just took effect May 1. Many voters remain unaware of the state's status, Sutherland said.\n\nEducation will be key for the Yes on 4, she added - especially with DeSantis on course to blur the initiative.\n\n\"It's about getting people to understand what the situation in Florida is and that in November, they have a choice,\" she said. \"That's really the core of our message - educating people on their options.\"\n\nFamiliar themes raised against Amendment 4\n\nThe Vote No on 4 campaign has drawn support from the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops and is centering its fight on familiar themes, concluding that it misleads voters.\n\nMany of the questions opponents raise reflect arguments made before the state Supreme Court by lawyers with Attorney General Ashley Moody, who allied with DeSantis and urged justices to bar the abortion proposal from the ballot.\n\nHow DeSantis created red Florida: How Florida turned red: Changing population, weak opposition, aggressive governor\n\nInstead, a 4-3 majority of justices dismissed the state's arguments, agreeing that voters should have a chance to decide the issue.\n\nIn a digital ad unveiled earlier this month, opponents renewed arguments that fetal \"viability\" is not defined in the amendment, that it fails to define \"patients' health\" when allowing a rare, later-term abortion, and doesn't define \"healthcare provider\" raising the specter of clinic staff running amok.\n\n\"Our campaign is focused on informing all Floridians that Amendment 4 is deceptive and dangerous, giving broad abortion approval rights to non-doctor clinical staff, allowing abortions for minors without parental consent and not only legalizing abortion during the first six months, but the entire pregnancy,\" said Taryn Fenske, a spokeswoman for opponents.\n\nDeSantis has appointed five of the currently conservative seven-member court. But three of his appointees formed the losing minority that wanted to keep the proposed amendment off the ballot.\n\nWith the fall campaigns slowly heating up, the governor now faces a rare disadvantage in fund-raising.\n\nAn alliance brewing?\n\nThe meager bottom line of the Florida Freedom Fund prompted intrigue when the governor last month sided with the state's hemp industry in vetoing a bill many thought could put them out of business.\n\nSome analysts viewed the veto as part of a pitch by DeSantis to get an ally in his fight against recreational marijuana, bringing the hemp industry in as a potential funder.\n\nSo far, that's not happening.\n\n\"I've seen comments from some hemp people saying that we need to help DeSantis on this,\" said Adam Terry, chief executive officer of Cantrip Seltzer, a THC-infused beverage company. \"But hemp people are pretty libertarian and don't tend to oppose marijuana.\"\n\nBut Terry acknowledged that it's still possible hemp interests could ally with DeSantis against what may be a common enemy.\n\n\"If marijuana is generally legal and available around Florida after this amendment, it's hard to believe that the hemp industry is going to compete effectively,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Florida governor ruled himself out of becoming Trump's running mate the following month and suggested he would try for the White House again in 2028.\n\nAt the time, Trump's campaign was not amused with what they saw as self-promotion by a beaten rival.\n\n\"Ron DeSantis failed miserably in his presidential campaign and does not have a voice in selecting the next Vice President of the United States,\" spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told The Post at the time. \"Rather than throw cheap shots from afar, Ron should focus on what he can do to fire Joe Biden and Make America Great Again.\"\n\nTrump senior adviser Chris LaCivita was even more blunt on X, writing that \"chicken fingers and pudding cups is what you will be remembered for you sad little man.\"\n\nIn April, Trump and DeSantis met face-to-face and agreed to let bygones be bygones.\n\n\"I am very happy to have the full and enthusiastic support of Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on April 29.\n\n\"We had a great meeting yesterday,\" he added. \"The conversation mostly concerned how we would work closely together to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Also discussed was the future of Florida, which is FANTASTIC!\"\n\n\"I greatly appreciate Ron's support in taking back our Country from the Worst President in the History of the United States,\" Trump said. \"November 5th is a BIG DAY!!!\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_caucuses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa caucuses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/general-view-fiserv-forum-workers-85231165.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719927", "eventUri": "eng-9719927", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-21", "textStart": 1565, "textEnd": 1572}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-29", "textStart": 2606, "textEnd": 2614}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 2965, "textEnd": 2977}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

As per Huff Post, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy were among the six possible running mates that Trump announced to host Laura Ingraham during a Fox News town hall event in Greenville, South Carolina. \"Are they all on your shortlist?\" Ingraham asked.\"They are,\" Trump said while adding. \"Honestly, all of those people are good. They're all good. They're all solid.\" However, DeSantis ruled out the possibility by telling his supporters over a Zoom call, \"People were mentioning me [as his vice president]. I'm not doing that,\" he confirmed.\n\n\"I know some people are really actively seeking it,\" he continued. \"It seems to me, just from watching kind of the body language and stuff, that you have a handful of folks who seem to be auditioning for it.\" The Florida Governor rejected the notion and then blasted how he thought Trump and his group were selecting vice presidential candidates, saying, \"I have heard that they're looking more in identity politics. I think that's a mistake.\" After withdrawing, DeSantis supported Trump, but he hasn't openly campaigned for the 2024 GOP runner since. The private call on Wednesday attracted over 200 participants, the majority of whom were individuals that DeSantis's team had sought out to serve as delegates at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nAs per ABC News, DeSantis highlighted his dissatisfaction with conservative media sources for what he saw as their inadequate coverage of Trump throughout the race.\"You know, he said at some point, he can shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose a vote. Well, I think he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and the conservative media wouldn't even report on it that it had happened. I mean, that's kind of where we're at,\" he said. He also hinted at a 2028 presidential run saying, \"I think a lot happens in politics.\"\n\nAs per The Hill, GOP political strategist, Chris LaCivita blasted DeSantis on X calling him a \"sad little man\", \"Chicken fingers and pudding cups is what you will be remembered for you sad little man,\" he tweeted in response to the Republican leader's political stance. LaCivita's scathing remarks highlight the deep resentment that some people in Trump's inner circle have for DeSantis -- a dissatisfaction that had seemed to be momentarily soothed when the governor of Florida withdrew from the 2024 race and endorsed Trump.\n\n\"Now we have a diverse Republican Party. I want everybody in the fold, don't get me wrong. But I don't want people representing 10, 15% of the party is in the driver's seat,\" DeSantis privately told his supporters over the virtual call as per NBC News. \"Ron DeSantis failed miserably in his presidential campaign and does not have a voice in selecting the next vice president of the United States,\" another Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stated in response. \"Rather than throw

DeSantis endorsed Trump and has pledged to help his campaign.\n\nYet neither will be speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. Haley won't be attending the convention. A spokesman for the former South Carolina governor said she wasn't invited.\n\nDeSantis will be in Milwaukee, but only on the periphery of the convention. The two-term Florida governor is scheduled to participate in a Moms for Liberty panel discussion and a breakfast with his state delegation . But a source familiar with the planning said DeSantis won't have a spot on the convention stage during the four-day affair.\n\nShowcasing future talent and promoting party unity typically are key elements of political conventions.\n\nBoth Haley and DeSantis are potential presidential candidates in 2028 and beyond, and there have been questions about whether Haley supporters, who tend to be more moderate, will back Trump in the general election.\n\nThat neither will have a speaking role may be a sign that Trump feels he's in a strong position within the GOP and doesn't need to worry about unifying the party. It also could be a sign of lingering tensions between Trump and his primary rivals. Trump framed both DeSantis' and Haley's presidential campaigns as acts of betrayal.\n\nTrump's endorsement propelled DeSantis to the governorship in 2018, and the former president said it was disloyal to challenge him in the primary. Haley served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. DeSantis challenged Trump from the right, while Haley targeted GOP voters at the other end of the spectrum.

Such a move would nullify Warren's earlier win and drag out his case for many more months at the appeals court.\n\nDeSantis' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Warren said there was \"no legitimate reason for this delay\" in resolving whether to rehear his lawsuit. The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Every day that passes in this posture is one in which the results of a free and fair election are denied,\" Warren's lawyers told the court.\n\nWarren is running for re-election, and the Democratic primary is Aug. 20. The general election is Nov. 5. In his filing, Warren said he has time remaining on his prior term as state attorney for Hillsborough County and that he should be allowed to finish it.\n\nDeSantis suspended Warren in 2022 after he pledged he would not bring criminal cases against people seeking or providing abortions despite legal restrictions that Florida has placed on the procedure. DeSantis later suspended a second prosecutor.\n\nDeSantis has maintained he suspended Warren for \"neglect of duty\" after Warren and other prosecutors signed a statement supporting abortion rights.\n\nWarren's lawsuit failed in the trial court, but the 11th Circuit said the case should proceed.\n\n\"The First Amendment prevents DeSantis from identifying a reform prosecutor and then suspending him to garner political benefit,\" the appeals panel said.\n\nU.S. judiciary statistics show the 11th Circuit median time between notice of appeal and final order is a little more than 10 months. Warren's appeal was docketed more than a year ago, in February 2023.\n\nThe case is Warren v. DeSantis, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-10459.\n\nFor Warren: David O'Neil of Debevoise & Plimpton; Jean-Jacques Cabou of Perkins Coie\n\nFor DeSantis: Henry Whitaker of the Florida

If DeSantis can't turn those numbers around and get voters to side with him, it will prove an significant setback heading into his final two years as governor.\n\nDuring bill signings and other recent official stops, DeSantis has gone off topic to run down the proposals.\n\n\"The governor's effort is all about persuasion, stopping at nothing. This is how Madison Avenue works,\" said Aubrey Jewett, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida who's monitored Florida ballot amendments for the past three decades.\n\n\"You don't have to persuade everybody. But there are plenty of people who haven't really made up their minds. They don't follow politics. And if (DeSantis) says something enough times, maybe they'll listen to him,\" he said.\n\nHis Freedom Fund, launched last month, has raised only $121,400 through the end of June, $100,000 of it coming from a Central Florida company, POB Ventures, which appears to be a marijuana-related organization.\n\nPat O'Brien, the company's authorized representative in documents filed with the state, did not immediately return phone calls or texts with questions about the contribution.\n\nStill, the governor's allies and those promoting the ballot measures say they expect DeSantis to raise enough cash to mount a vigorous opposition campaign by the time voters become more engaged in the fall.\n\nThe Florida Republican Party also has come out against the two ballot proposals, a move sure to help the governor in dollars and messaging.\n\nMeanwhile, Amendments 3 and 4 have massive volumes of cash for their own voter persuasion.\n\nThe abortion rights Amendment 4, had about $15.6 million on hand last month. Amendment 3 had $13.1 million, powered by Quincy-based Trulieve, the medical marijuana company that contributed most of the $60 million raised so far, with much of that spent on the petition campaign that positioned it for the ballot.\n\nOrganizers of the amendment campaigns point to the popularity of the measures, not the vast amount of money that will help drive their message to Floridians. But as proof of their robust finances, Amendment 3 has already begun airing TV spots.\n\nMore: John Morgan, Florida's 'Pot Daddy,' now the voice of recreational marijuana ad campaign\n\nAlthough still early for massive media blitzes, both sides in the two ballot fights are likely to prove a steady presence on TV and social media platforms by fall.\n\n\"The governor shouldn't take for granted Florida voters, including the 57% in his own party who are supportive of Amendment 3,\" said Morgan Hill, spokeswoman for Smart & Safe Florida, citing findings of the recent Fox News poll.\n\n\"They know better than to believe these scare tactics that haven't been a problem in more than half the country that has already legalized recreational use,\" she added.\n\nNatasha Sutherland, with the Yes on 4 campaign, also said that the governor's \"mistruths and disinformation\" will be countered by proponents.\n\n\"His approach indicates that he knows that Floridians are with us on this issue, and he's really grasping at straws,\" Sutherland said.\n\nAlthough 84,000 abortions were performed last year in Florida, among the highest totals in the nation, Florida's six-week law just took effect May 1. Many voters remain unaware of the state's status, Sutherland said.\n\nEducation will be key for the Yes on 4, she added - especially with DeSantis on course to blur the initiative.\n\n\"It's about getting people to understand what the situation in Florida is and that in November, they have a choice,\" she said. \"That's really the core of our message - educating people on their options.\"\n\nThe Vote No on 4 campaign has drawn support from the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops and is centering its fight on familiar themes, concluding that it misleads voters.\n\nMany of the questions opponents raise reflect arguments made before the state Supreme Court by lawyers with Attorney General Ashley Moody, who allied with DeSantis and urged justices to bar the abortion proposal from the ballot.\n\nHow DeSantis created red Florida: How Florida turned red: Changing population, weak opposition, aggressive governor\n\nInstead, a 4-3 majority of justices dismissed the state's arguments, agreeing that voters should have a chance to decide the issue.\n\nIn a digital ad unveiled earlier this month, opponents renewed arguments that fetal \"viability\" is not defined in the amendment, that it fails to define \"patients' health\" when allowing a rare, later-term abortion, and doesn't define \"healthcare provider\" raising the specter of clinic staff running amok.\n\n\"Our campaign is focused on informing all Floridians that Amendment 4 is deceptive and dangerous, giving broad abortion approval rights to non-doctor clinical staff, allowing abortions for minors without parental consent and not only legalizing abortion during the first six months, but the entire pregnancy,\" said Taryn Fenske, a spokeswoman for opponents.\n\nDeSantis has appointed five of the currently conservative seven-member court. But three of his appointees formed the losing minority that wanted to keep the proposed amendment off the ballot.\n\nWith the fall campaigns slowly heating up, the governor now faces a rare disadvantage in fund-raising.\n\nThe meager bottom line of the Florida Freedom Fund prompted intrigue when the governor last month sided with the state's hemp industry in vetoing a bill many thought could put them out of business.\n\nSome analysts viewed the veto as part of a pitch by DeSantis to get an ally in his fight against recreational marijuana, bringing the hemp industry in as a potential funder.\n\nSo far, that's not happening.\n\n\"I've seen comments from some hemp people saying that we need to help DeSantis on this,\" said Adam Terry, chief executive officer of Cantrip Seltzer, a THC-infused beverage company. \"But hemp people are pretty libertarian and don't tend to oppose marijuana.\"\n\nBut Terry acknowledged that it's still possible hemp interests could ally with DeSantis against what may be a common enemy.\n\n\"If marijuana is generally legal and available around Florida after this amendment, it's hard to believe that the hemp industry is going to compete effectively,\" he added.\n\nJohn Kennedy is a reporter in the USA TODAY Network's Florida Capital Bureau.

Ron's role in the campaign is yet to be determined, but he was clear that he wanted to help in every way he could.\"\n\nWhat's clear now: Trump is willing to have DeSantis help in a more prominent role than expected previously, a good sign for the Governor and an indication that the rancor of the primary season is relegated to the dustbin of history.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Ron] DeSantis is taking his war on culture to a new level,\" Katie Blankenship, director of PEN America's Florida office, told the Associated Press.\n\n\"This decision will not only devastate the arts but add to his legacy of censorship and disregard for art, literature, and knowledge.\"\n\nThe Sun Sentinel reports, \"The GableStage Theatre Company told supporters of the Miami-Dade County theater that 'we fell victim to the heartless power of a veto pen,' and The Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival told its patrons that it was 'still reeling from the devastating news.'\"\n\nSounds pretty negative to us.\n\nWhat did DeSantis do?\n\nIn his original budget for the 2024 legislative session the governor didn't include a single dime for \"arts and culture.\"\n\nFlorida's legislature, filled with the weak, put $32 million dollars in the budget for 600 arts and cultural programs and 33 community theaters -- every single one hotbeds of left-adherents and leftism.\n\nThese grants by Republicans are so stupid and so pointless.\n\nThe giveaways don't even buy votes. Ninety-five percent of the permanent staff -- in Florida numbering 91,000! -- are left-adherent voters!\n\nDeSantis, bless his heart, proceeded to veto every single dollar.\n\nUSA Today said DeSantis explained his veto thusly, \"DeSantis said the budget line was condemned because a handful of fringe festivals -- which he said are 'like a sexual festival' -- could draw financing.\n\n\"We didn't have control over how it was being given,\" Florida's 46th governor said of the individual grant awards, during a Thursday appearance in Polk County.\n\n\"So, you're having your tax dollars being given in grants to things like the Fringe Festival, which is like a sexual festival where they're doing all this stuff.\n\n\"How many of you think your tax dollars should go to fund that? Not very many people would do that.\"\n\nThis causes us to wonder how the 'arts community's' counter-cultural, sexual libertinism and thumb-in-the-eye of Middle America is working out now?\n\nBased on news coverage, the funding vetoed by DeSantis did not amount to even 10% of any of the organization's budgets and was usually much less, but it's still Armageddon for those expecting a government check.\n\nAP found Robert Kesten, executive director of the Stonewall National Museum Archives & Library in Fort Lauderdale -- an organization that celebrates and promotes the gay lifestyle and all its variations -- who wailed, \"It hurts us dramatically in our ability to pay rent and pay salaries.\"\n\nDeSantis has already shipped illegal immigrants north to Martha's Vineyard, we don't see anything stopping him from offering bus rides to unemployed \"arts\" professionals who would be happier in a blue state anyway.\n\nDeSantis' answer to the outcry is simple, \"These roads are important. I can sell that. Education is important. I can sell that. Preserving our natural resources is important. I can sell that. I can't sell the Fringe Festival to taxpayers, nor would I want to sell the fringe festival to taxpayers.\"\n\nThe governor's decision to stop funding his political opponents came as quite a shock to those who had grown comfortable cashing the checks sent by timid Republicans.\n\n\"I don't think anybody thought it was going to happen,\" Jennifer Jones, president and CEO of the Florida Cultural Alliance, said. \"[DeSantis] recommended nothing, and by golly, he delivered.\"\n\nMichael Reagan, the eldest son of President Reagan, is a Newsmax TV analyst.

Ron DeSantis is now planning to address former President Donald Trump's nominating convention next week, an apparent reversal from just one day earlier when he was expected not to give a speech.\n\nDeSantis' speaking role at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was confirmed Wednesday by a person familiar with the schedule who spoke on condition of anonymity because the schedule has not yet been released.\n\nOnce allies turned rivals during this year's Republican primary, Trump and DeSantis have tried to achieve a d\u00e9tente that benefits both of them. But there are lingering tensions between their camps -- and long memories in Trump's orbit about the hazards of elevating a former primary opponent to the convention stage.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who ran against Trump in a similarly bitter GOP race eight years ago, famously gave a speech at the 2016 Republican convention in which he declined to endorse Trump by name and instead told voters to follow their consciences.

Ron DeSantis is expected to speak at the GOP's convention in Milwaukee next week.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis and dozens of other high-ranking Florida politicians are headed to Milwaukee next week for the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe convention, which will take place July 15 to 18, is a chance for the party to rally behind former President Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nDeSantis, once Trump's rival for the GOP presidential nomination, will give a speech on the main stage. He will also appear at a Moms for Liberty town hall and speak at a breakfast hosted by the Republican Party of Florida.\n\nThe governor ended his bid for president and endorsed Trump in January after a primary loss in Iowa, but the relationship between the two remains strained.\n\nOther Florida officials headed to Wisconsin include U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio -- rumored to be on Trump's vice president shortlist -- Rep. Byron Donalds, Sen. Rick Scott, Attorney General Ashley Moody, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis.\n\nU.S. Rep. Laurel Lee, whose district includes parts of Hillsborough, Pasco and Polk counties, will also attend, a spokesperson said. In March, Trump called for a \"MAGA Republican\" to challenge Lee for her seat, but then last month endorsed Lee in the race.\n\n\"We'll have a complete cast of who's who in Florida politics,\" Evan Power, chairperson of the Republican Party of Florida, said in an interview.\n\nDelegates will nominate Trump as the Republican candidate at the convention. Trump's selection is largely a formality, as he passed the 1,215-delegate threshold needed to cinch the nomination in March.\n\nTrump is also expected to announce his running mate in the coming days.\n\nAt a rally in Doral on Tuesday, Trump teased Rubio as his pick. Speaking about his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, Trump said to Rubio, \"You may or may not be there to vote for it -- but you'll be involved.\"\n\nAlso reportedly on Trump's shortlist are North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, among others.\n\nFlorida is sending 125 delegates to the convention. The executive committee for the Republican Party of Florida chose 41 at-large delegates, spokesperson Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9 said. They must be Florida residents registered to vote as Republicans. The remaining 84 delegates were picked by party leadership in each congressional district.\n\nThree of the presumptive nominee's children are among the Florida delegates: Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Boulos. Key Trump backers were also chosen, including billionaire Isaac \"Ike\" Perlmutter and Sergio Gor, the leader of a major pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nOther delegates include state lawmakers who endorsed Trump over DeSantis in the GOP primary, such as Sens. Joe Gruters and Debbie Mayfield and Reps. Randy Fine and Mike Beltran. Moody, Patronis and Simpson are also delegates.", "source": {"uri": "tampabay.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tampa Bay Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

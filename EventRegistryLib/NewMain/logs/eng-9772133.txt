It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine, especially.\"\n\nOne of the main medal contenders, Sam Short, failed to reach the final. The Australian who took silver at last year's World Championships in this distance finished third in the same heat as Wiffen.\n\nHe and compatriot Elijah Winnington - who took silver in the 400m on Saturday - went out quickly but Wiffen had overhauled Short by the halfway mark and Winnington shortly afterwards and never relinquished the lead.\n\nBut he believes there is more to come.\n\nHe said: \"It's never comfortable, but it wasn't at 100 percent. It's tough to say, but we'll go with it being 95 percent.\n\n\"You didn't see my legs come in at the end so that's where it is, but I was holding a good pace.\n\n\"You see the Australians go out fast, I'm a middle swimmer, like to hold a fast pace no one else can hold.\n\n\"I'm not going in there with 100 percent effort trying to make the final. I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final.\n\n\"I've never been in this shape before in my life.\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster, I was just off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that so that would have been pretty cool to get but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"I'm happy with the morning swim and a fast time as well, I'm pretty happy. There's no significance to being the fastest qualifier, just I've got a great lane to look around.\"\n\nWiffen said that, although he cannot normally hear the crowd, it was different in La D\u00e9fense Arena where he was cheered on by considerable Irish support.\n\nAnd he admitted there were nerves before the got in the water.\n\nHe said: \"I was more nervous than I was before the World Championships, but that's just the Olympics, a different kind of level. But I dealt with it quite well. A bit nervous around the first 100m, but then I settled in.\n\n\"It's completely different, in Tokyo I was just there really qualified, and just tried to keep progressing.\n\n\"The past three years have been a blast for me, improving by 15 seconds in the 1500m every time I swam in the water, PBing in every international.\n\nAnd Wiffen intends to spend the evening swotting up on his opponents.\n\nHe said: \"I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them, I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes.\n\n\"I said before, any lane has a chance.

That was set in Tokyo, where the event returned to the Olympics for the first time since 1904.\n\nBut as a double World champion this year - in the 800m and also the 1500m, which he will get to later this week - Wiffen has a big target on his back.\n\nBobby Finke, the reigning Olympic champion, leads the posse who want to take down a swimmer who has improved beyond recognition from the one that finished 14th in Tokyo in the 800, breaking the national record in the process. He has been lowering it ever since.\n\n\"The past three years have been a blast for me,\" said Wiffen. \"I've been dropping 16 seconds every time I swam in the water in the 1500, and I've been PBing at every single international.\n\n\"I wasn't going in there with 100% effort trying to make the final - I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final.\n\n\"I said before, any lane has a chance. I'll be looking at everybody, I'll be doing my homework tonight, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there.\"\n\nOne of his biggest dangers, the Australian Sam Short, was overtaken and left well behind by Wiffen in the heat. Short didn't make the final and afterwards revealed that a virus had hampered his chances.\n\nWiffen also reeled in another Aussie, the 400m silver medallist Elijah Whittington, who pushed himself into the early lead. The Armagh man beat Whittington to gold in the Worlds six months ago.\n\nSo he is confident but also a little wary of the challenge that could come from not just Finke and from the likes of second fastest qualifier Ahmed Jaouadi of Tunisia, but from some lesser known names.\n\nWiffen planned to spend last night doing his homework on all of his final opponents. \"I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them, I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes,\" he noted.\n\n\"I was more nervous than I was before the World Championships, but that's just the Olympics, a different kind of level. But I dealt with it quite well. A bit nervous around the first 100m, but then I settled in.\"\n\nWiffen hails from Magheralin, on the border of Armagh and Down - and while both counties may claim him he is happy to add Armagh's All-Ireland final triumph on Sunday as more fuel for his bid for two or even three Olympic medals in the days to come.\n\n\"Yeah, Armagh won,\" he smiled. \"My birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day...what is it, 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\"\n\nAnd, on the basis of the last few days, the atmosphere tonight in the La Defense Arena could be very special.\n\n\"I never really hear the crowd when I'm swimming, that one I could hear, 100%,\" Wiffen smiled. \"There was a lot of Irish support, I saw a lot of tricolours in the stands so I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nWiffen's medal bid will start at 8.02pm on Tuesday night in the La Defense Arena.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType":

It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\"\n\nREAD MORE:Ellen Walshe celebrates with roomie Mona McSharry as they both make swim final\n\nREAD MORE:What Irish athletes are in Olympics action on Monday? Full list for day 3 in Paris and day 2 results\n\nIt does, certainly on the basis of the first swim for the 23-year-old at the re-customed La Defense Arena this morning. Wiffen stormed to victory in the fourth of the four heats that doubled up as semi-finals, reeling in and passing two of his main medal rivals Sam Short and Elijah Whittington of Australia.\n\nWhittington, already a silver medal winner at these Games in the 400m Freestyle, went out strong and led for half of the race but Wiffen slowly took control and won in a time of 7:41.53, his third fastest ever.\n\nAfterwards he insisted that he was running at around 95% of his full capacity, but that there was much more to come. \"It's never comfortable, but it wasn't at 100%.,\" said the Loughborough student.\n\n\"You didn't see my legs come in at the end, so that's where it is, but holding a good pace, happy with the morning swim and a fast time as well, I'm pretty happy.\n\n\"I was more nervous than I was before the World Championships, but that's just the Olympics, a different kind of level. But I dealt with it quite well. A bit nervous around the first 100m, but then I settled in.\n\n\"You see the Australians go out fast, I'm a middle swimmer, like to hold a fast pace no one else can hold. I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them, I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes.\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster, I was only 0.4 off an Olympic record (it was actually 0.25 off it) and no Irishman or woman has ever done that, so that would have been pretty cool to get. But we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"I'm not going in there with 100% effort trying to make the final - I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final. I said before, any lane has a chance. I'll be looking at everybody, I'll be doing my homework tonight, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night.\n\n\"I've never been in this shape before in my life.\"\n\nShort finished third behind Wiffen and Whittington and didn't make the final. Bobby Finke, the reigning champion, may be his biggest rival but there are newer names in the final, too, that the Irish hopeful says he will study as he recovers and gears up for tomorrow.\n\nAt the same time, only Finke and Tunisian teenager Ahmed Jaouadi - who finished second fastest of the qualifiers behind Wiffen this morning - weren't in the World Championship final won by Wiffen in February.\n\nAsked if he would be happy with winning a silver or bronze medal from this position of strength, Wiffen replied: \"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine (the 10,000m open water race),

Wiffen could become the first Irishman, and just the second Irish athlete ever, to claim Olympic swimming gold -- and his hopes were boosted with challenger Sam Short of Australia, considered the favourite by some analysts, failing to qualify. The 23-year-old Wiffen topped qualifying in 7:41.53, ahead of Tunisia's Ahmed Jaouadi.\n\nBut he will also need to hold off defending Olympic champion Bobby Finke of the United States, in-form Australian Elijah Winnington and experienced Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri, Tokyo silver medallist, in an open field.\n\n\"Any lane has a chance, I'll be looking at everybody, I'll be doing my homework tonight, seeing how everybody swims it, and I'll be making sure that I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night,\" Wiffen told reporters.\n\nMichelle Smith's three golds and a bronze from the Atlanta Games in 1996 remains Ireland's only Olympic medals in swimming.\n\nBut Wiffen, was born in Yorkshire, England, before moving to County Down in Northern Ireland at the age of two, says he isn't fixated on the gold.\n\n\"Any medal's good, it's my first race here, and it's my first time actually being in contention for an Olympic medal, so I'll take any medal, whatever colour,\" he said.\n\nWiffen is in his second Olympics, having entered the 800 and 1500 metre races in Tokyo, but after his rapid rise in the sport he says there is little comparison.\n\n\"It is completely different. In Tokyo, I was just really qualifying and trying to keep progressing. The past three years have been a blast for me -- I've been dropping 16 seconds every time I've swam in the water in the 1500, and I've been PB-ing every single international, I just want to keep that streak up here,\" he said.\n\nThe heats, held in the morning, have drawn impressive crowds and Wiffen says the noise they generate is felt by the swimmers.\n\n\"I very rarely hear the crowd when I'm swimming but this one I can hear 100 percent. There's a lot of Irish support, I saw a lot of tricolours in the stands, so pretty happy,\" he said.\n\nHe is making the most of these Games -- as well as the two races at the La Defense Arena, he also plans to race in the 10km open water race in the River Seine.\n\nIt is a heavy workload, but Wiffen says he is the fittest he has ever been, describing himself as \"100 percent.\"", "source":

It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\"\n\nRead next: World champion swimmer Daniel Wiffen confident of gold medal glory at Paris Olympics\n\nRead next: Daniel Wiffen prepares to go for gold again after making history in Doha\n\nWiffen certainly made waves at La Defense Arena earlier today, clinching first place in his heat, which simultaneously served as a semi-final, outpacing major rivals including Aussie duo Sam Short and Elijah Whittington.\n\nWhittington, who has already bagged a silver at these Games in the 400m Freestyle, took the early lead but was overtaken by Wiffen who triumphed with a time of 7:41.53, clocking in his third-fastest performance ever.\n\nSpeaking post-race, the Loughborough University student shared that while the semi-final didn't push him to his limits, there's plenty more in the tank. \"It's never comfortable, but it wasn't at 100%.,\" the young star remarked.\n\n\"You didn't see my legs come in at the end, so that's where it is, but holding a good pace, happy with the morning swim and a fast time as well, I'm pretty happy. I was more nervous than I was before the World Championships, but that's just the Olympics, a different kind of level. But I dealt with it quite well. A bit nervous around the first 100m, but then I settled in.\n\n\"You see the Australians go out fast, I'm a middle swimmer, like to hold a fast pace no one else can hold. I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them, I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes.\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster, I was only 0.4 off an Olympic record (it was actually 0.25 off it) and no Irishman or woman has ever done that, so that would have been pretty cool to get. But we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"I'm not going in there with 100% effort trying to make the final - I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final. I said before, any lane has a chance. I'll be looking at everybody, I'll be doing my homework tonight, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night. I've never been in this shape before in my life.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would be content with a silver or bronze medal from his current position, Wiffen responded: \"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine (the 10,000m open water race), especially.\"\n\nSign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Daniel Wiffen becomes the first athlete from Northern Ireland to win an Olympic gold medal since 1988.\"\n\nThat led to a number of people pointing out that Wiffen, who was draped in an Irish tricolour after the race, had won the medal for Ireland.\n\nOne person said: \"Look what it says on his shirt.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"He's Irish and representing Ireland.\"\n\nSomeone else posted: \"That top doesn't say Northern Ireland??\"\n\n\"It clearly says Ireland on his shirt and he's even pointing to it,\" read another comment.\n\nStormont First Minister Michelle O'Neill and deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly were among the many people to congratulate Wiffen.\n\n\"This is truly a momentous occasion for Daniel and for local sport,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\n\"Not only has he secured NI's first Olympic gold medal in 36 years, it is also the first medal of the Games for our athletes and he set a new Olympic record. It was a fantastic performance by the @TeamIreland swimmer.\"\n\nWiffen said afterwards said: \"I don't think a lot of people actually believed me that I was going to do it tonight but yeah it was incredible. I've done it - that's all I want to say!\n\n\"I was so nervous, that's the most nervous I've ever been for a race but do you know what calmed me down - I heard by brother shout for me as soon as I walked out. I heard none of the crowd - just him, and that's what calmed me down, and really levelled my head.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, there's this whole saying going around that I'm getting 'Finked' - I'm

Ahmed Jaouadi, the 19-year-old from Tunisia, was fourth in 7:42.83.\n\nFew of us can ever begin to imagine being stuck in this moment. Olympic champion, Olympic gold medal winner, Wiffen now blissfully immortalised in his own event and given that rare and lasting place in the reels of Irish sporting history too.\n\nIn the now century of our Olympic participation, only nine Irish people, six men and three woman, had ever experienced becoming an Olympic champion, Olympic gold medal winner, since the country was first allowed to compete for itself as the Free State in time for the 1924 Olympics in Paris.\n\nWiffen now becomes number 10, also improving his own Irish and European record of 7:39.19, set last summer when finish fourth at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nElijah Winnington from Australia was the early leader at the 100m mark, Jaouadi in second, Wiffen just over a metre down in third, as that leading trio set off at just inside world record pace.\n\nThose fortunate enough to even stand on the Olympic medal podium will also tell you it's a place that must be truly believed in for it ever to be seen, and rarely had any Irish athlete believed he'd soon be standing there more than Wiffen. His four years at Loughborough University in England has also tempered that belief.\n\nWiffen's confidence, however, was not unfounded, his heat time of 7:41.53 inside the Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena on Monday morning was the fastest of the eight finalists, giving him the prime lane four for this medal showdown.\n\nPaltrinieri started in lane three, Jaouadi in five, and Finke in lane two, so Wiffen also had them within view.\n\nWiffen's walkout into the arena was again as cool as he likes it, mimicking it seemed the carving of his own name into history (fingers perhaps crossed just in case). Only Wiffen's time is now Olympic medal-winning gold time\n\nFinke, the 24-year-old from Florida, was back in Paris to defend both the 800 and 1,500m titles he won in Tokyo.\n\nIn getting this far, Wiffen already become the first Irish male swimmer to make an Olympic final, as bold and impressive as he would have liked.\n\nEver since the first session on Saturday, the Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena has been transforming itself into one of the loudest swimming dance halls in Olympic history, and Tuesday night's 19,000-sell-out was no exception.\n\nHis parents Jonathan and Rachal Wiffen watching from the stands, along with twin brother Nathan - as indeed were the parents of Finke, Joe and Jeanne.\n\nAfter turning 23 on Bastille Day, it continues Wiffen's magnificence trajectory of improvement since qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics as a 19-year-old, finishing some distance outside the finals there despite setting then Irish records of 7:51.65 for the 800m (finishing 14th) and 15:07.69 for the 1500m (finishing 20th).\n\nAlso in the now century of Ireland's participation in the Olympics going back to Paris in 1924, only two Irish swimmers had also previously won a medal, Michelle Smith de Bruin becoming the first when winning four in 1996, before McSharry won the race to become just the second on Monday night, with her magnificent bronze in the 100m breaststroke.\n\nWiffen had also won his last five consecutive championship finals, the 800m-1,500m double at the World championships in February, where he was also named best male swimmer, two months after winning the 400m-800-1,500m treble at the European short-course championships, where he also broke the world record.\n\nIn Tokyo, Finke was only fourth at the last turn, but came through to win in 7:41.87. He came close here too, just not close enough to claw back Wiffen.\n\nWiffen still has two more events to come, the 1,500m by his own admission possibly his best distance, before he takes on the 10km marathon swim next Friday week.\n\nAnd move over Tarzan.\n\nA century after Johnny Weissmuller won three gold medals in the pool at the 1924 Olympics also here in Paris, announcing himself as one of the best freestyle swimmers in the world, Wiffen has continued his meteoric trajectory in the sport, with no fear or need to look back now.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

I said before, any lane has a chance.

He has been lowering it ever since. One of his biggest dangers, the Australian Sam Short, was overtaken and left well behind by Wiffen in the heat. Short didn't make the final and afterwards revealed that a virus had hampered his chances.\n\nWiffen also reeled in another Aussie, the 400m silver medallist Elijah Whittington, who pushed himself into the early lead. The Armagh man beat Whittington to gold in the Worlds six months ago.\n\nDouble celebrations?\n\nWiffen hails from Magheralin, on the border of Armagh and Down - and while both counties may claim him he is happy to add Armagh's All-Ireland final triumph on Sunday as more fuel for his bid for two or even three Olympic medals in the days to come.\n\n\"Yeah, Armagh won,\" he smiled. \"My birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day...what is it, 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris?

Daniel Wiffen, Olympic champion,\" he told Ireland's RTE television. \"It's really good. I can't believe it.\"\n\nThe only other Irish swimmer to win an Olympic swimming title was women's triple champion Michelle Smith in 1996, and Wiffen was also Northern Ireland's first gold medallist in 36 years.\n\n\"I mean, I'm not going to lie, I did tell everybody already I was going to do it before. So it's just good to see it on paper,\" Wiffen told reporters later as some measure of calm returned.\n\nElijah Winnington led for the first 350 metres, with Wiffen easing into second place only at 250, but the Australian faded and the battle between the top three took off.\n\nWiffen led at the halfway point with Finke second but Paltrinieri, the Tokyo silver medallist, took the lead at 650 and stayed there until the final 50.\n\nThe Irishman, who had appeared to be spent, then turned on the afterburners and blasted down the final length to touch the wall first.\n\nHe turned around in triumph, putting his hands to his head before raising his fists to salute the crowd -- with a vocal Irish contingent -- at the La Defense Arena.\n\nWiffen, who won 800 and 1,500 gold at the world championships in Doha in February, donned his spectacles for the podium and dabbed repeatedly at his eyes as the Irish anthem sounded.\n\n\"I've never heard that national anthem at Olympics before,\" he said.\n\nThe medal was Ireland's second in the pool in Paris, with Mona McSharry taking women's 100 breaststroke bronze on Monday night.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris posted on X: \"Yes Daniel Wiffin! Masterful. Gold for Ireland. Those last 100 metres were mind blowing!! World class. Olympic record.\n\n\"I met Daniel's parents Rachel & Jonathan & brother Nathan at the weekend so know this is a dream come through for the whole family.

He would also be only the second swimmer after Michelle Smith de Bruin.\n\nHis confidence is not unfounded. Wiffen's heat time of 7:41.53 inside the Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena on Monday morning was the fastest of the eight finalists, giving him the prime fourth lane for the final.\n\nHe is the first Irish male swimmer to make an Olympic final.\n\n\"It's never comfortable, but it wasn't at 100 per cent,\" said Wiffen of his semi-final, where he took over the lead from just after the halfway mark, as the Australian duo of Sam Short and Elijah Winnington set the pace.\n\n\"I'm not going in there with 100 per cent effort trying to make the final. I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final. I said before, any lane has a chance. I'll be looking at everybody, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night.\"\n\nAfter the four heats, defending champion Bobby Finke from the US was only fifth with his 7:43.00, with Ahmed Jaouadi from Tunisia also laying down a marker with his 7:42.07, the second fastest of the lot.\n\nWiffen will also have to contend with Gregorio Paltrinieri from Italy, the 2016 Olympic champion in the 1,500m, who won silver in the 800m in Tokyo. Wiffen will also be aiming for gold in the longer event, plus the 10km marathon swim in the Seine.\n\nHe's also won his last five consecutive championship finals, the 800m-1,500m double at the World Championships in February, two months after winning the 400m-800-1,500m treble at the European short-course championships.\n\n\"One hundred per cent I'm the fittest I've ever been, I've never been in this shape before in my life. The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster, only 0.25 off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that, so that would have been pretty cool to get, but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal, so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we've got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine especially.\"\n\nAfter Armagh winning the All-Ireland football title on Sunday, he also believes a medal might be written in the stars.\n\n\"Yeah Armagh won, my birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day, and 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris?

This is an enormous result for Daniel Wiffen who will have centre lane in tomorrow night's final.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Winnington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Winnington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.independent.ie/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The colour of the medal was gold.\n\nHis arms were aching, his lungs nearly empty, but nothing was going to stop him on a famous night in Paris.\n\nAt the end, he turned and looked up the at the big screen -- Olympic champion over 800m and the first Irishman ever to win a medal in the pool at the Games.\n\nRead More: Daniel Wiffen strikes gold as the Terminator in his greatest performance yet\n\nRead More: Meet Daniel Wiffen, the Magheralin world champion with Olympic dreams\n\nA new Olympic record too.\n\n\"I was dying in the last 20 metres and I'm not sure if you saw that because my arms were in so much pain,\" said Wiffen.\n\n\"But I knew that the crowd was gonna carry me in and that's exactly what happened.\n\n\"I saw the red light on the block and then that was it.\"\n\nHe always credits his twin brother Nathan for pushing him along, getting under his skin when needed and giving him that extra motivation to get better.\n\nNathan is his training partner for life, his best friend and housemate. And his fellow YouTube star.\n\nLast night he helped settle his nerves too for the biggest race of his life.\n\n\"The only voice I heard in the crowd was my twin brother Nathan's,\" said Wiffen.\n\n\"That's what actually kept me level-headed when I walked out. It was just written in the stars.\"\n\nThe pair have nearly 4,000 subscribers to their Wiffen Twins page and post regular updates on everything from training to the 8,000 calories per day needed to fuel their swimming ambitions.\n\nIn their younger days they starred in BBC kids programmes and featured briefly in Game of Thrones.\n\nNathan was there again last night, wearing a green Team Wiffen T-shirt, urging him on as Wiffen took centre stage, this time the headline act. Child's play no more.\n\nAt the final turn it looked like anyone's race as Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri led with 50 metres to go. Then Wiffen got to work, hunting him down and storming to victory.\n\nAbout seven minutes and 38 seconds earlier the 23-year-old from Magheralin stood on the starting blocks in lane four.\n\nEither side of him were 19-year-old Tunisian Ahmed Jaouadi and Paltrinieri -- a three-time Olympic medallist, who won silver in this event in Tokyo.\n\nLurking dangerously on the blocks for lane two was Bobby Finke, the reigning Olympic 800m freestyle champion and the first American swimmer to win gold at 1500m in 37 years when he took that title in Tokyo as well.\n\nWiffen had not faced Finke when he won the world 800m final in Doha. This was a chance to settle that.\n\nWiffen has always been sure of his place at swimming's top table. Confidence is a preference for him. Last night he made good on it.\n\nBut an Olympic medal isn't won just on finals night -- a night of light shows, raucous crowds and glitz and glamour.\n\nWiffen's was won on the dark mornings and evenings in Lurgan and Lisburn and swimming pools up and down Ireland.\n\nIt was won in the countless sessions at Loughborough, the warm-ups, the swim-downs and the hard yards in training. In his case often as much as 80kms a week.\n\nHe set a new Irish record when competing in Tokyo, barely out of his teens and the records have been tumbling ever since.\n\nTwo years ago he finished fourth at the world Championships with a new European record and in February of this year he became world champion at 800m and 1500m.\n\nAt the worlds in February, Wiffen reeled in Paltrinieri over the final 50 to win and it was the same last night.\n\nIn the end, Paltrinieri was caught in the final strokes by Finke, who took silver for USA with the Italian taking bronze.\n\nWhen the medals came and the flags went up there were tears from Wiffen.\n\n\"I don't normally cry, so I was really hoping nobody was going to see that,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\n\"But it did come out of me, and it's obviously just a special moment.\"\n\nOne he will never forget.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie",

Daniel Wiffen, Olympic champion,\" he told Ireland's RTE television. \"It's really good. I can't believe it.\"\n\nThe only other Irish swimmer to win an Olympic swimming title was women's triple champion Michelle Smith in 1996, and Wiffen was also Northern Ireland's first gold medallist in 36 years.\n\n\"I mean, I'm not going to lie, I did tell everybody already I was going to do it before. So it's just good to see it on paper,\" Wiffen told reporters later as some measure of calm returned.\n\nElijah Winnington led for the first 350m, with Wiffen easing into second place only at 250m, but the Australian faded and the battle between the top three took off.\n\nWiffen led at the halfway point with Finke second but Paltrinieri, the Tokyo silver medallist, took the lead at 650 and stayed there until the final 50.\n\nThe Irishman, who had appeared to be spent, then turned on the afterburners and blasted down the final length to touch the wall first.\n\nHe turned around in triumph, putting his hands to his head before raising his fists to salute the crowd - with a vocal Irish contingent - at the La Defense Arena.\n\nWiffen, who won 800m and 1,500m gold at the world championships in Doha in February, donned his spectacles for the podium and dabbed repeatedly at his eyes as the Irish anthem sounded.\n\n\"I've never heard that national anthem at Olympics before,\" he said.\n\nThe medal was Ireland's second in the pool in Paris, with Mona McSharry taking women's 100 breaststroke bronze on Monday night.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Simon Harris posted on X: \"Yes Daniel Wiffin! Masterful. Gold for Ireland. Those last 100m were mind blowing!! World class. Olympic record.\n\n\"I met Daniel's parents Rachel & Jonathan & brother Nathan at the weekend so know this is a dream come through for the whole family.

Being a double world champion, that was only natural. But in the space of seven minutes, 41.53 seconds yesterday, the 23-year-old sent it a whole lot higher.\n\nWiffen came into the 800m freestyle as a contender but ahead of the final, at 8.02pm Irish time tonight, he's the man to beat. That's due to the controlled, classy display he unleashed to win his heat yesterday, his time making him the quickest qualifier and just a quarter of a second shy of the Olympic record.\n\nWhat was more ominous for Wiffen's rivals: he was keeping something in reserve. \"It wasn't at 100 per cent,\" he said. \"We'll go with 95. You didn't see my legs come in at the end so that's where [the extra bit] is, but I was holding a good pace and am happy with the morning swim.\"\n\nWiffen has been building for years towards this peak and said it's \"100 per cent\" the fittest he's ever been. A medal won't come easy, but after a memorable weekend for Armagh, one of their proudest sons now senses he might fulfil what he has long deemed his destiny.\n\n\"Yeah, Armagh won,\" he said. \"My birthday is on July 14, Bastille Day. What is it, 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris [in their first Olympic appearance as an independent nation]? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\".\n\nWiffen is drawn in lane four in tonight's final, with his chief rivals around him: Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri and USA's Bobby Finke to his left, Tunisia's Ahmed Jaouadi and Australia's Elijah Winnington to his right.\n\nWiffen said there was \"no significance\" to having the fastest qualifying time but he's \"got a great lane to look around\" as a result. \"Any lane has a chance,\" he added. \"I'll be doing my homework, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best.\"\n\nHe looked majestic in his heat yesterday, coasting into the lead just after halfway and drawing clear in the third quarter.\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster,\" he said. \"I was only off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that so that would have been pretty cool, but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them. I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes.\"\n\nOnly nine athletes have ever won gold at the Games for Ireland and no Irishman has ever reached the podium in swimming.

I love our flat, our team atmosphere, everything.\n\n\"I just love being part of Team Ireland.\"\n\nWhile a bit of a throwaway remark, when RTE cut back to their Montrose studio pundit Earl McCarthy did pick up on that remark.\n\nHe noted that Wiffen's preparation might not be going optimally based on that complaint.\n\nBut the proof is in the...pool and so far, he looks set to justify his pre-Olympics status as one of Ireland's main medal hopes.\n\nIn another media appearance, Wiffen added:\n\n\"Armagh won (the All-Ireland), my birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day, what is it 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine, especially.\"\n\nOne of the main medal contenders, Sam Short, failed to reach the final.\n\nThe Australian who took silver at last year's World Championships in this distance finished third in the same heat as Wiffen.\n\nHe and compatriot Elijah Winnington - who took silver in the 400m on Saturday - went out quickly but Wiffen had overhauled Short by the halfway mark and Winnington shortly afterwards and never relinquished the lead.\n\nBut he believes there is more to come.\n\nHe said: \"It's never comfortable, but it wasn't at 100 percent. It's tough to say, but we'll go with it being 95 percent.\n\n\"You didn't see my legs come in at the end so that's where it is, but I was holding a good pace.\n\n\"You see the Australians go out fast, I'm a middle swimmer, like to hold a fast pace no one else can hold.\n\n\"I'm not going in there with 100 percent effort trying to make the final. I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final.\n\n\"I've never been in this shape before in my life.\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster, I was just off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that so that would have been pretty cool to get but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"I'm happy with the morning swim and a fast time as well, I'm pretty happy. There's no significance to being the fastest qualifier, just I've got a great lane to look around.\"\n\nWiffen said that, although he cannot normally hear the crowd, it was different in La D\u00e9fense Arena where he was cheered on by considerable Irish support.\n\nAnd he admitted there were nerves before the got in the water.\n\nHe said: \"I was more nervous than I was before the World Championships, but that's just the Olympics, a different kind of level.\n\n\"But I dealt with it quite well. A bit nervous around the first 100m, but then I settled in.\n\n\"It's completely different, in Tokyo I was just there really qualified, and just tried to keep progressing.\n\n\"The past three years have been a blast for me, improving by 15 seconds in the 1500m every time I swam in the water, PBing in every international.\n\nAnd Wiffen intends to spend the evening swotting up on his opponents.\n\nHe said: \"I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them, I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes.\n\n\"I said before, any lane has a chance. I'll be looking at everybody, I'll be doing my homework tonight, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_whelan@thesun.ie", "name": "Vincent Whelan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earl McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loughborough University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Winnington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Winnington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bastille Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINA_World_Aquatics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FINA World Aquatics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_D\u00e9fense", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La D\u00e9fense"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "La D\u00e9fense"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/newspress-collage-8o8pz7g7i-1722334479559.jpg?1722338036&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1233, "textEnd": 1242}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

I've been practicing my whole year for this,\" Wiffen said.\n\n\"I was just looking and looking over [my shoulder]... I saw this is over, I've won.\"\n\nWiffen described being referred to as a gold medalist Olympian as \"amazing\" as he thanked his family, coach and Irish teammates.\n\n\"I couldn't to it without everybody, I am not alone out there,\" he said.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy. I have won everything... and now the Olympics.\n\n\"Now I can say that I'm probably the best ever so that's just even better.\"\n\nStormont's Deputy First Minister was among the first to congratulate NI's latest Olympic champion.\n\nEmma Little-Pengelly took to social media to post: \"Amazing!! Well done Daniel Wiffen.\n\n\"Northern Ireland's first individual gold since Lady Mary Peters in 1972! (and from Lagan Valley too!) What a result!\"\n\nAlliance leader Naomi Long also shared her congratulation online, adding: \"What a stunning performance!\"\n\nSport NI's interim chief executive Richard Archibald expressed immense pride.\n\n\"After a 36 year wait Daniel Wiffen is bringing an Olympic gold medal home to Northern Ireland!\" he said.\n\n\"At Sport NI we are immensely proud of Daniel and his achievements.\n\n\"We are proud to have supported Daniel at the start of his career through our National Lottery funded Athlete Award. His progress over the last few years has been incredible, with European and World titles as well as a coveted world record and now an Olympic record.\n\n\"He is an inspiration to us all and I am sure his win will encourage many young people across Northern Ireland to try their hand at swimming. With two more events to come the sky is the limit for Daniel and we wish him all the very best!\"\n\nEarlier, McMillan had competed for Team GB in the semi-finals earlier in the day helping the squad get to the final ahead of their stunning victory.\n\nThe 24-year-old, who previously represented Ireland in the Tokyo Games but switched teams for his shot at Olympic glory, put in a strong leg, securing a time of 1:45.68 to maintain GB's advantage, before Kieran Bird and Tom Dean finished the heat in 7:05.11.\n\nHe dropped out for the final with Matt Richards and Duncan Scott replacing him and Bird in the line-up - but still leaves Paris with a gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The colour of the medal was gold. His arms were aching, his lungs nearly empty, but nothing was going to stop him on a famous night in Paris.\n\nAt the end, he turned and looked up the at the big screen -- Olympic champion over 800m and the first Irishman ever to win a medal in the pool at the Games. A new Olympic record too.\n\n\"I was dying in the last 20 metres and I'm not sure if you saw that because my arms were in so much pain,\" said Wiffen.\n\nREAD MORE: NI man wins Olympic gold medal 'after 36 year wait'\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Daniel Wiffen? Inside life of Magheralin Olympic sensation\n\n\"But I knew that the crowd was gonna carry me in and that's exactly what happened.\n\n\"I saw the red light on the block and then that was it.\"\n\nHe always credits his twin brother Nathan for pushing him along, getting under his skin when needed and giving him that extra motivation to get better.\n\nNathan is his training partner for life, his best friend and housemate. And his fellow YouTube star.\n\nLast night he helped settle his nerves too for the biggest race of his life.\n\n\"The only voice I heard in the crowd was my twin brother Nathan's,\" said Wiffen.\n\n\"That's what actually kept me level-headed when I walked out. It was just written in the stars.\"\n\nThe pair have nearly 4,000 subscribers to their Wiffen Twins page and post regular updates on everything from training to the 8,000 calories per day needed to fuel their swimming ambitions.\n\nIn their younger days they starred in BBC kids programmes and featured briefly in Game of Thrones.\n\nNathan was there again last night, wearing a green Team Wiffen T-shirt, urging him on as Wiffen took centre stage, this time the headline act. Child's play no more.\n\nAt the final turn it looked like anyone's race as Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri led with 50 metres to go. Then Wiffen got to work, hunting him down and storming to victory.\n\nAbout seven minutes and 38 seconds earlier the 23-year-old from Magheralin stood on the starting blocks in lane four.\n\nEither side of him were 19-year-old Tunisian Ahmed Jaouadi and Paltrinieri -- a three-time Olympic medallist, who won silver in this event in Tokyo.\n\nLurking dangerously on the blocks for lane two was Bobby Finke, the reigning Olympic 800m freestyle champion and the first American swimmer to win gold at 1500m in 37 years when he took that title in Tokyo as well.\n\nWiffen had not faced Finke when he won the world 800m final in Doha. This was a chance to settle that.\n\nWiffen has always been sure of his place at swimming's top table. Confidence is a preference for him. Last night he made good on it.\n\nBut an Olympic medal isn't won just on finals night -- a night of light shows, raucous crowds and glitz and glamour.\n\nWiffen's was won on the dark mornings and evenings in Lurgan and Lisburn and swimming pools up and down Ireland.\n\nIt was won in the countless sessions at Loughborough, the warm-ups, the swim-downs and the hard yards in training. In his case often as much as 80kms a week.\n\nHe set a new Irish record when competing in Tokyo, barely out of his teens and the records have been tumbling ever since.\n\nTwo years ago he finished fourth at the world Championships with a new European record and in February of this year he became world champion at 800m and 1500m.\n\nAt the worlds in February, Wiffen reeled in Paltrinieri over the final 50 to win and it was the same last night.\n\nIn the end, Paltrinieri was caught in the final strokes by Finke, who took silver for USA with the Italian taking bronze.\n\nWhen the medals came and the flags went up there were tears from Wiffen.\n\n\"I don't normally cry, so I was really hoping nobody was going to see that,\" said the 23-year-old.\n\n\"But it did come out of me, and it's obviously just a special moment.\"\n\nOne he will never forget.\n\nSign up to our f ree sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox.", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk",

No Irishman has ever won gold in swimming at the Olympics. Wiffen, the world champion, could change that.\n\nHe will face a strong field of participants, including the reigning championBobby Finke,Gregorio Paltrinieri,Elijah Winningtonand surprising Tunisian qualificationAhmed Jaouadi.\n\nWiffen is also the world record holder in the short distance in this event and knows how to set his pace. So does Finke, the champion in two distances in Tokyo.\n\nWinningtonwho won silver in the 400m freestyle earlier in this competition, leads the 200m, from Jaouadi and Wiffen. They are all under the world record pace.\n\nWiffen and Finke both narrowly pass Jaouadi at 300 metres, while Winnington is still ahead.\n\nThe Irishman looks around to make sure he can match Winnington, and now that he's halfway there, he's taken the lead. Jaouadi tries to swim into Wiffen's wash. Finke and Paltrineri are second and third in the 400, while Winnington has decided to simply drop back.\n\nIt's still Wiffen, now leading from Paltrinieri, who once won a world title in the 1500m solo swim from lane one. Wiffen is just 0.06 ahead of the Italian at the 550 bend, with Finke also in the mix. It's a 200m sprint between the three.\n\nThe margin between Wiffen and Paltrinieri has dropped to 0.01 seconds! The Italian is heading towards 650, did Wiffen go too early? Paltrinieri leads with three lengths to go!\n\nThey come back for the bell lap, two lengths left and the crowd has turned up the volume. Wiffen tries to turn this back, as does Finke, who had a great last 50 in Tokyo.\n\nWiffen timed this well! 0.10 seconds into the race as they head home! And here comes Finke, just like in Tokyo!\n\nIt's a grandstand finish!Daniel Wiffen wins gold for Ireland in Olympic record time!\n\nHe raises both arms in the air and drops the microphone. 7:38.19.\n\nBobby Finke wins silver after a fast finish, 0.56 behind; Paltrinieri bronze in 7:39.38.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "800 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Paltrinieri", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gregorio Paltrinieri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irishman_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Irishman (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://img.olympics.com/images/image/private/t_social_share_thumb/f_auto/primary/gtwy2irg1rwkghw1ds4e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Cooney reports from La Defense Arena, Paris\n\nIT'S FAIR TO say that that we here on the island of Saints and Yerrahs are unfamiliar with Daniel Wiffen's kind of dominance.\n\nThis morning he cruised into the final of the men's 800m freestyle at the Paris Olympics, posting the competition's fastest time as he did so. Oh, and he effectively pulled up at the line.\n\n\"It's never comfortable, but I wasn't at 100 percent\", said Wiffen. \"You didn't see my legs come in at the end so that's where it is, but holding a good pace, happy with the morning swim and a fast time as well, I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nAsked as to what percentage he was motoring at, Wiffen laughed and said, \"that's a tough one to say, we'll go with 95.\"\n\nWiffen's Australian opponents in his heat, Elijah Winnington and Sam Short, went out hard, but he calmly and gradually scythed them down. He took the lead at the 500 metre mark and left everyone bobbing about in his wake from there.\n\nHe held back his kick for the line, so he has afterburners to thrust in tomorrow's final if he needs it. Those who have worked for Wiffen say his greatest power is not necessarily in his legs, but in the awesome pulling power of his arms.\n\nOthers might look at his remarkable self-confidence as the greatest weapon in his arsenal.\n\n\"I'm not going in there with 100 percent effort trying to make the final\", he said. \"I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final. I said before, any lane has a chance. I'll be looking at everybody, I'll be doing my homework tonight, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster, I was only 0.25 off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that. so that would have been pretty cool to get but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\"\n\nThat time, by the way, was Wiffen's third-fastest ever.\n\nWiffen says the only benefit to posting the fastest time is the fact he will be racing from lane four in tomorrow night's final, from which he says he can have a good look around at his competition.\n\nThat competition is suddenly looking tamed. Aussie Sam Short was deemed one of his biggest medal rivals, but having struggled with illness at last month's national trials, he shockingly failed to make the final. The 2023 world champion meanwhile, Tunisia's Ahmed Hafnaoui, pulled out of the Games a couple of months ago.\n\nWiffen's biggest rivals in tomorrow night's final will be American Bobby Finke and Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri.\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here\", said Wiffen, \"it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this.\"\n\nWiffen will race the 1500m in the pool too, before he takes to the Seine for the 10km open water event.\n\nLook hard enough across the rippling water and you might have seen Ireland's rising tide. Ireland have never before had more than one swimmer make the final of a single Olympic Games, but we qualified two within an hour this morning, as Ellen Walshe followed Mona McSharry and preceded Wiffen in joining the very elite of the elite.\n\nThe qualification process for the longer-distance events is necessarily swift: there are no semi-finals so, like Wiffen, Ellen Walshe had to rank among the eight-fastest times across two heats.\n\nShe initially made a slow start in the opening butterfly section, lagging seventh at the first turn, before then seguing into the backstroke, her weakest discipline of those being examined. But she clung on, and when she glanced to her left - having been landed awkwardly in lane one - she battled through the water.\n\n\"I knew I had 200 to go, I could see the middle of the field and thought, 'Okay, I just need to turn on the gears and fight'\", said Walshe. \"I had a strong finish and I am delighted to go into the final tonight.\"\n\nShe wasn't happy with her time of 4:39.97, more than two seconds off her personal best. Resetting that record is her ambition in a final for which Canada's world record holder Summer Mcintosh is the favourite.\n\n\"It was such a relief\", said Walshe of the moment she realised she had made the cut. \"The time left my head which I wasn't too over the moon with, but I have another chance to have a go at this tonight.\"\n\nDanielle Hill, meanwhile, took care of her business by placing 16th in the heats of the 100m breaststroke to progress to her semi-finals tonight.\n\n\"Pretty cool\", said Wiffen of his team-mate's results.\n\nHe expects more of his own success to follow.\n\n\"Armagh won, my birthday is on 14 July, Bastille Day. What is it, 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\"", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gavin_cooney@the42.ie", "name": "Gavin Cooney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Winnington", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Winnington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Walshe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ellen Walshe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Hafnaoui", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Hafnaoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Paltrinieri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregorio Paltrinieri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Hill_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Hill (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bastille Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6449379/listing?version=6449462&width=590", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 4791, "textEnd": 4798}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Finke did too but Wiffen's management of the race was paced perfectly and he had just enough to hold off the American.\n\n\"I don't think a lot of people actually believed me that I was going to do it tonight but yeah it was incredible,\" Wiffen said. \"I've done it - that's all I want to say!\n\n\"I was so nervous, that's the most nervous I've ever been for a race but do you know what calmed me down - I heard my brother shout for me as soon as I walked out. I heard none of the crowd - just him, and that's what calmed me down, and really levelled my head.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, there's this whole saying going around that I'm getting 'Finked' - I'm glad to say I haven't been 'Finked\" so obviously pretty happy to get my hand on the wall first.\"\n\nIreland pays tribute to 'history-maker' Wiffen\n\nWiffen becomes the first gold medallist from Northern Ireland for 36 years and Ireland's first-ever male swimming gold medallist.\n\nThe last athletes from Northern Ireland to win Olympic gold were Stephen Martin and Jimmy Kirkwood, who were part of the winning Team GB Hockey team at Seoul in 1988, while Wiffen is the first individual gold medallist from Northern Ireland since Mary Peters triumphed for GB in the pentathlon at Munich in 1972.\n\nStormont First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Deputy First Minister Emma Little Pengelly congratulated the swimming hero.\n\n\"This is truly a momentous occasion for Daniel and for local sport,\" they said in a joint statement. \"Not only has he secured NI's first Olympic gold medal in 36 years, it is also the first medal of the Games for our athletes and he set a new Olympic record.

Gavin Cooney reports from La Defense Arena, Paris\n\nTHE REVELATION OF the night was perhaps less the gold medal or the Olympic Record but that Daniel Wiffen was nervous.\n\nThe man who one went to a sports psychologist to be told he didn't need a sports psychologist woke up this morning feeling a tiny pinprick of doubt.\n\n\"I know that I seem very confident on the outside\" he said, \"but there's always a little percentage of you thinking, 'Can I do this?'\"\n\n800 metres is not quite his favourite distance. No, that's the 1500m. For any other swimmer, the longer the exposure to Daniel Wiffen, the greater the pain.\n\nBut the 800m? Perhaps it wasn't quite long enough. Perhaps one, two, or even three of the world's best swimmers were sufficiently fortified to survive seven-odd minutes looking directly into the sun.\n\nBut Wiffen tackled his nerves as best he could. He went to work. He went for a quick session in the pool and told John Rudd of Swim Ireland that he wanted to hit 1:02. He clocked 1:01.01.\n\n\"It's done\", Wiffen told Rudd. \"We've won.\"\n\nWiffen was last to swagger out for the race, status earned by going fastest in the heats. He was also given the central lane four, from which he could keep a darting eye on his two main rivals, America's Bobby Finke and Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri.\n\nLook at the casual swing of those long, limby arms: it's hard to believe the force with which they pull him through the water. They could haul down statues.\n\nBut it seems not all the nerves were gone. He said afterwards that his first 300 metres were \"absolutely terrible. My stroke was all over the place.\"\n\nTo the rest of us it looked like a standard teeth-clenched tussle for an Olympic gold medal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs he did in Wiffen's semi-final, Australia's Elijah Winnington went out fast, and lead for the first half of the race. Wiffen found his rhythm at the 300m mark, and Winnington would soon vacate the premises. He ceased being relevant from 400 metres. He allegedly finished last.\n\nNow was time for Wiffen to worry about Finke and Paltrinieri to his immediate left in lane three.\n\n\"My goal was to keep building, keep building, keep building.\"\n\nBut he couldn't shake Palrinieri.\n\nThe splits were winnowing with every fifty metres.\n\nWiffen's 0.47 second lead at 500 metres became 0.06. Then 0.01. Then they jacknifed. Wiffen was second, 0.57 seconds behind. It got worse. With 100 metres to go, he trailed by 0.78 seconds.\n\nBut then came the recovery. Paltrinieri had made his investment in a subprime mortgage, because soon he was about to be bankrupt. He led Wiffen by a tenth of a second as they hit the wall for the final 50 metres, but then the Italian fell. He managed to hold on for a bronze medal.\n\nBut the final boss wasn't done.\n\n\"I was literally looking at Bobby Finke. That's all I was doing. I was like, 'this guy comes about the fastest, well, not the fastest any more.\"\n\nWiffen's glance at Finke cost him what he described as a \"lopey stroke\", but he quickly ratcheted it tight. Sprint.\n\n\"I was dying last 20 metres and I'm not sure if you saw that. because my arms were in so much pain.\n\n\"But I knew that the crowd was gonna carry me in, and that's exactly what happened.\"\n\nWiffen at the moment of triumph. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO\n\nHe hit the wall in 7:38.19, a new Olympic record. The Olympic record he promised on Monday night. That Finke and Paltrinieri both finished within the old record time accentuated what Wiffen had just done. They both brought the best they had and it still wasn't enough.\n\nWiffen climbed out of the pool and pumped his arms with a confident kind of steadiness. He said the only voice in the crowd he heard was his twin brother's. He returned 35 minutes later in his tracksuit, stood atop the podium, and let a few tears roll down his cheek as Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann rang around the arena and the Irish flag began its slow, slow, gorgeously slow ascent in front of him.\n\nThe crowning that awaits all great Irish athletes is to be known nationwide by their first name. Sonia, Kellie, Katie, Roy, Jack, Johnny, Ruby...Mona.\n\nWiffen might be the first to become a verb.\n\nWiffen (verb): to execute brilliantly and in so doing have all your thoughts about your brilliance confirmed.\n\nFind a car parking spot right outside the supermarket on a busy Friday evening? You've Wiffened it.\n\nJump through the Dart doors as they are closing? You've Wiffened it.\n\nFix that leaky tap without calling a plumber? You've Wiffened it.\n\n\"There's a whole saying going around of getting Finked\", Wiffen told RT\u00c9.\n\nNot anymore.

In doing so, he recorded his third fastest time ever - 7.41.53 - as Wiffen's dreams of Olympic glory in Paris remain firmly on course.\n\nConsidering the high the county is already on after Kieran McGeeney's men toppled Galway on Sunday, the Magheralin man is hoping to tap into that mood when the final comes around.\n\n\"I mean, Armagh won, my birthday's on July 14th, Bastille Day, it's 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris... just everything seems to be aligning, doesn't it?\"\n\nAnd, despite posting such an impressive time, Wiffen insists there is much more to come when he takes to the water on Tuesday night.\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all - I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster.\n\n\"I was only 0.4 off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that so that would have been pretty cool to get, but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"It's never comfortable, but it wasn't at 100 per cent - you didn't see my legs come in at the end so that's where it is, but holding a good pace, happy with the morning swim and a fast time as well, I'm pretty happy.\n\n\"I'm not going in there with 100 per cent effort trying to make the final... I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final. I've got a great lane to look around but, I said before, any lane has a chance.\n\n\"I'll be looking at everybody, I'll be doing my homework tonight, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night.\"\n\nWhen he travelled to Tokyo three years ago, Wiffen wasn't in the frame at the top end of competition; as an experience, it was a world away from where he stands now.\n\nMonday's heat affirmed his position as the hunted going into the final and, despite having been on this stage before - albeit in entirely different circumstances - there were nerves as he made the walk poolside.\n\n\"I was more nervous there than when I won the World Championships.\n\n\"That's just the Olympics. It's a different kind of level. Yeah, I was nervous but I dealt with it quite well. You're nervous round the first 100, then you settle in.\n\n\"I never really hear the crowd when I'm swimming, that one I could hear, 100 per cent. There was a lot of Irish support, I saw a lot of tricolours in the stands so I'm pretty happy.\n\n\"In Tokyo I was just there already qualified, trying to keep progressing.

The Magheralin man swims in the 800m freestyle final on Tuesday evening, July 30, at 8pm.\n\nThe former Loughborough University student is favourite for the race having cruised to victory in the semi-final and Wiffen himself is making no bones about his own targets.\n\nIn 2021, he competed in the men's 800m freestyle and 1,500m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics. In 2022, he won a silver medal representing Northern Ireland in the 1,500m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games.\n\nRead next: Daniel Wiffen storms into Olympic 800m Freestyle final with Armagh's victory on his mind\n\nRead next: Rory McIlroy had 'sense of resentment' surrounding Team Ireland decision over GB\n\nTwo years ago, he became the first Irish swimmer to break a European record in history. Since then, the 23-year-old has added one gold and two silver European U23 medals, three European gold medals - both in 2023 - and two World gold medals.\n\nWiffen is a twin brother with his brother Nathan also a brilliant swimmer in his own right. Earlier this year Daniel became the fourth man to do the distance double when he won the 1500m freestyle by more than 10 seconds at the World Championships up in Doha.\n\nEarlier this week, Wiffen posted the third fastest 800m time of his career to secure a Paris final spot - and the opportunity to win a first individual summer Olympics gold by a Northern Ireland athlete since Lady Mary Peters' 1972 pentathlon triumph.\n\nHow old is Daniel Wiffen?\n\nDaniel Wiffen is 23. He was born on July 14, 2001.\n\nWhere is he from?\n\nHe was born in London, but moved to Magheralin, on the Down Armagh border at the age of two.\n\nWho is his brother?\n\nHsi twin brother is called Nathan and he is also a world class swimmer. He finished fourth in the 1,500m at the 2024 European Championships.\n\nThe siblings once worked as extras in Game of Thrones - in the iconic 'Red Wedding' scene.\n\nSwimming is in the blood for the Wiffens as their mum swam at a high level as did their older brother Ben who now works as a coach.\n\nHis thoughts on his Olympic chances:\n\n\"Armagh won, my birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day, what is it 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine, especially.\"\n\nDaniel Wiffen will compete in the 1,500m Freestyle and Open Water 10km in Paris.\n\nSign

It is the 37th Olympic medal won the Irish athletes since 1928.\n\nWiffen was the last of the eight finalists to be introduced and he received a big reception from the packed arena.\n\nAustralia's Elijah Winnington set the early pace leading the field through the first five laps with Wiffen just behind.\n\nBut the Armagh swimmer took the lead for the first time on lap 8 with the veteran Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri closest.\n\nAt the 600m mark he was still ahead but then the Italian took over with the defending Olympic champion Bobby Finke in third spot.\n\nAs the final reached its climax, Wiffen retook the lead and was second at 750m and then he powered ahead in final 50 to win in an new Olympic record of 7:38.10 ahead of Finke (7.38. 75) with Paltrinieri picking up another Olympic medal in third spot.\n\nBut the evening belonged to Wiffen.\n\nThe double 800m/1500m World champion will attempt to make it an Olympic double in the longer event later this week.\n\nBut for the moment the Loughborough University student from Magheralin, in County Armagh can savour the greatest moment of his career\n\nWiffen, who is coached in Loughborough by Andi Manley posted the fastest time (7.41.53) of the eight finalists including defending Olympic champion Bobby Finke (US) and 2016 gold medallist Gregorio Paltrinieri in the heats. But he underlined his class to improving his time when he needed too.\n\nSince accepting a sports scholarship at Loughborough University along with his twin brother Nathan, having previous swam competitively with Lurgan SC, he made remarkable progress.\n\nHe first display his potential as a rookie at the Tokyo Games three years ago setting new Irish records of 7:51.65 and 15:07.09 when placing 14th and 20th respectively in the 800m and 1500m.\n\nHe secured a silver at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in 2022.\n\nA year later in Japan he was fourth in both the 800m and 1500m at World Championships, with a new European record in the 800m.\n\nThen at the European short course championships last year he won three gold medals (400m, 800m, 1500m) where his 7:20.46 smashed Grant Hackett's world record from 2008.\n\nIn February 2024, he not only became the first Irish swimmer to medal at a World LC Championships but became a double world champion in 800m/1500m and his 13:34:07 was the fifth fastest in history.\n\nIt has been quite a week for Armagh. And Wiffen is by no means finished.\n\nHe is out again in the heats of the 1500m on Saturday with the final 24 hours later and has also entered the 10km marathon swim scheduled for the Seine, though with the postponement of the men's triathlon it remains to be seen whether this event will go ahead as scheduled.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish

He finished fourth in the 1,500m at the 2024 European Championships.\n\nThe siblings once worked as extras in Game of Thrones - in the iconic 'Red Wedding' scene.\n\nSwimming is in the blood for the Wiffens as their mum swam at a high level as did their older brother Ben who now works as a coach.\n\nHis thoughts on his Olympic chances:\n\n\"Armagh won, my birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day, what is it 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine, especially.\"\n\nDaniel Wiffen will compete in the 1,500m Freestyle and Open Water 10km in Paris.\n\nGet

I've done it - that's all I want to say!\n\n\"I was so nervous, that's the most nervous I've ever been for a race but do you know what calmed me down - I heard by brother shout for me as soon as I walked out. I heard none of the crowd - just him, and that's what calmed me down, and really levelled my head.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, there's this whole saying going around that I'm getting 'Finked' - I'm glad to say I haven't been 'Finked\" so obviously pretty happy to get my hand on the wall first.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 30 Jul 2024, 9:31 PM Last updated: Tue 30 Jul 2024, 11:28 PM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meath Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "800 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Paltrinieri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gregorio Paltrinieri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Winnington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Winnington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Organising_Committee_of_the_Olympic_and_Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=40d8da5e-a503-5c4e-9783-3992554031e5&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99852&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The 800m is obviously quite a new event in the Olympics.\n\n\"But obviously I'm an 800m Olympic champion, it definitely feels great and exceeded my expectations.\"\n\nHe shed a tear on the podium as the tricolour went up and the national anthem rang out around the La D\u00e9fense Arena.\n\nWiffen admitted he started the race poorly and it was halfway before he edged in front.\n\nPaltrinieri fought back over the last 400 and the Italian was just ahead at the final turn, but he had burned himself out.\n\nThen it was Wiffen time.\n\n\"Really my first 300m was absolutely terrible. My stroke was all over the place,\" said Wiffen.\n\n\"I was just so nervous that I couldn't get any stroke in. But luckily I had a good enough easy speed to keep it going, I was still in the race.\n\n\"And then, my goal was to keep building, keep building, keep building.\"\n\nDefending champion Bobby Finke was able to reel in Paltrinieri in the final metres, but he couldn't get near Wiffen.\n\n\"I was literally looking at Bobby Finke.

Gavin Cooney The 42, reports from La Defense Arena, Paris\n\nThe 42 Editor's note: This article by Gavin Cooney forms part of The 42's subscriber-only coverage of the Paris 2024 Olympics, with unique insights and fresh perspectives on the biggest stories every single day. If you'd enjoy more great sportswriting like this, you can sign up here for a free one-month trial to The 42.\n\nTHE REVELATION OF the night was perhaps less the gold medal or the Olympic Record but that Daniel Wiffen was nervous.\n\nThe man who once went to a sports psychologist to be told he didn't need a sports psychologist woke up this morning feeling a tiny pinprick of doubt.\n\n\"I know that I seem very confident on the outside\" he said, \"but there's always a little percentage of you thinking, 'Can I do this?'\"\n\n800 metres is not quite his favourite distance. No, that's the 1500m. For any other swimmer, the longer the exposure to Daniel Wiffen, the greater the pain.\n\nBut the 800m? Perhaps it wasn't quite long enough. Perhaps one, two, or even three of the world's best swimmers were sufficiently fortified to survive seven-odd minutes looking directly into the sun.\n\nBut Wiffen tackled his nerves as best he could. He went to work. He went for a quick session in the pool and told John Rudd of Swim Ireland that he wanted to hit 1:02. He clocked 1:01.01.\n\n\"It's done,\" Wiffen told Rudd. \"We've won.\"\n\nWiffen was last to swagger out for the race, status earned by going fastest in the heats. He was also given the central lane four, from which he could keep a darting eye on his two main rivals, America's Bobby Finke and Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri.\n\nLook at the casual swing of those long, limby arms: it's hard to believe the force with which they pull him through the water. They could haul down statues.\n\nBut it seems not all the nerves were gone. He said afterwards that his first 300 metres were \"absolutely terrible. My stroke was all over the place.\"\n\nTo the rest of us it looked like a standard teeth-clenched tussle for an Olympic gold medal.\n\nAs he did in Wiffen's semi-final, Australia's Elijah Winnington went out fast, and lead for the first half of the race. Wiffen found his rhythm at the 300m mark, and Winnington would soon vacate the premises. He ceased being relevant from 400 metres. He allegedly finished last.\n\nNow was time for Wiffen to worry about Finke and Paltrinieri to his immediate left in lane three.\n\n\"My goal was to keep building, keep building, keep building.\"\n\nBut he couldn't shake Palrinieri.\n\nThe splits were winnowing with every fifty metres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWiffen's 0.47 second lead at 500 metres became 0.06. Then 0.01. Then they jacknifed. Wiffen was second, 0.57 seconds behind. It got worse. With 100 metres to go, he trailed by 0.78 seconds.\n\nBut then came the recovery. Paltrinieri had made his investment in a subprime mortgage, because soon he was about to be bankrupt. He led Wiffen by a tenth of a second as they hit the wall for the final 50 metres, but then the Italian fell. He managed to hold on for a bronze medal.\n\nBut the final boss wasn't done.\n\n\"I was literally looking at Bobby Finke. That's all I was doing. I was like, 'this guy comes about the fastest, well, not the fastest any more.\"\n\nWiffen's glance at Finke cost him what he described as a \"lopey stroke\", but he quickly ratcheted it tight. Sprint.\n\n\"I was dying last 20 metres and I'm not sure if you saw that. Because my arms were in so much pain.\n\n\"But I knew that the crowd was gonna carry me in, and that's exactly what happened.\"\n\nWiffen at the moment of triumph. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO\n\nHe hit the wall in 7:38.19, a new Olympic record. The Olympic record he promised on Monday night. That Finke and Paltrinieri both finished within the old record time accentuated what Wiffen had just done. They both brought the best they had and it still wasn't enough.\n\nWiffen climbed out of the pool and pumped his arms with a confident kind of steadiness. He said the only voice in the crowd he heard was his twin brother's. He returned 35 minutes later in his tracksuit, stood atop the podium, and let a few tears roll down his cheek as Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann rang around the arena and the Irish flag began its slow, slow, gorgeously slow ascent in front of him.\n\nThe crowning that awaits all great Irish athletes is to be known nationwide by their first name. Sonia, Kellie, Katie, Roy, Jack, Johnny, Ruby...Mona.\n\nWiffen might be the first to become a verb.\n\nWiffen (verb): to execute brilliantly and in so doing have all your thoughts about your brilliance confirmed.\n\nFind a car parking spot right outside the supermarket on a busy Friday evening? You've Wiffened it.\n\nJump through the Dart doors as they are closing? You've Wiffened it.\n\nFix that leaky tap without calling a plumber? You've Wiffened it.\n\n\"There's a whole saying going around of getting Finked,\" Wiffen told RT\u00c9.\n\nNot anymore. This was the night a whole sport shifted, and a country couldn't quite believe it was finally tilting towards us.\n\nWritten by Gavin Cooney and originally published on The 42 whose award-winning team produces original content that you won't find anywhere else: on GAA, League of Ireland, women's sport and boxing, as well as our game-changing rugby coverage, all with an Irish eye.

Standing at the top of the podium and having an Olympic gold medal around his neck.\n\nThe twist is he didn't think it would happen in the 800m freestyle but in his preferred longer distance of 1500m. Even Wiffen has the capacity to surprise himself.\n\nBut this is a man who also keeps living up to his own billing. He came to Paris to win gold, never shied away from telling anyone and he backed up those words in the most glorious way inside the La D\u00e9fense Arena as he set a new Olympic record of 7:38.19 to win the 800m freestyle. It is, indeed, Wiffen time.\n\n\"It's going to be really weird to say but I dreamt of this moment so many times in my head. I've gone over it in so many different ways about what's going to happen. To be fair in my eyes I didn't really think I was going to do it in the 800m because it's not my favourite event,\" Wiffen said after with the gold medal around his neck.\n\n\"My favourite event is the longer distance. And the 800m is obviously a new event but obviously I'm an 800m Olympic champion and it definitely feels great.\"\n\nA gold medal in his first ever Olympic final, this is the Wiffen way. For his walkout, he did the action of writing his name into the history books. He was still playing the showman. But he was nervous, he wasn't as calmed as he looked.\n\n\"Uh, definitely not. The only voice I heard in the crowd was my twin brother Nathan's. I think that's what actually kept me level-headed when I walked out,\" he said.\n\n\"And, yeah, it was just written in the stars. I said before here it was Bastille day on my birthday, 100 years since Ireland competed, there was also a storm tonight at 9pm. I said to my coach Steve (Beckerleg, national centre Dublin coach), I was like, oh yeah, we're renaming our storm Storm Daniel.\"\n\nIt was a fascinating race. Wiffen took-over the lead from Australia's Elijah Winnington at the half-way point for the first time in the race.\n\nThen Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri - in lane three next to him - took charge and Wiffen just sat on him. It was all building up to the last 50m and then is when Wiffen emptied himself into a finishing kick.\n\nTokyo gold medallist Bobby Finke took silver with Paltrinieri in third. In Wiffen's assessment, it was far from the perfect race.\n\n\"So I had been training every different scenario that is going to happen. Normally I would only train one way and that's to try to hold on, burn everybody out in the middle, but I knew that the Olympics is completely different and you don't know how you are going to feel in the first 100m,\" he said.\n\n\"Really my first 300m was absolutely terrible. My stroke was all over the place. I was just so nervous that I couldn't get any stroke in. But luckily I had a good enough easy speed to keep it going, I was still in the race.\n\n\"And then, my goal was to keep building, keep building, keep building. Got to the 150m in my head, it went so fast so that was lucky.\n\n\"And then I was literally looking at Bobby Finke, that's all I was doing. I was like, this guy comes back the fastest, well, not the fastest anymore. He comes back the fastest.\n\n\"I was like we need to have at least a body length on him. I was doing this weird loopy stroke to try to have a look. Went on the last wall turn, put my head down and sprinted the last 20.\n\n\"I was dying the last 20m and I'm not sure if you saw that because my arms were in so much pain. But I knew that the crowd was going to carry me in and that's exactly what happened. I saw the red light on the block and then that was it.\"\n\nThe double world champion has another job to come in these Olympics in the pool. He's back for the 1,500m heats on Saturday with the final on Sunday. This is his favoured event. And boy, is he just getting started.\n\n\"This is 100 per cent not the end. I'm only 23. Peak age for my event is 27, but you saw Paltrinieri there in the last 100m and he's like 29. Who knows what's going to happen in the future, but I'm very happy today to say that I'm Olympic champion,\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah, 1500m on Saturday.

That was thrilling enough as he wiped away tears standing on the podium, the Irish flag draped over his shoulders.\n\nPerhaps just as importantly, the 23-year-old Irishman is sure to pick up some new followers on his YouTube channel -- a pitch he made when asked how people can learn more about a swimmer who is largely unknown outside his country.\n\n\"People should watch,\" Wiffen said after winning the 800-meter freestyle on Tuesday night. \"I blog every week -- show you exactly what an Olympic champion does day-in, day-out in the pool.\"\n\nGet ready for a flood of fans, Daniel.\n\nWearing round glasses and looking studious, Wiffen cried as the Irish anthem played in La Defense Arena. He may not look the part of an Olympic champion, but his performance in the pool says otherwise.\n\nWiffen will be back later in the Paris Games, hoping to win another gold on Sunday in the 1,500 meters -- the final day of competition in the pool.\n\n\"I don't normally cry, so I really hope nobody is going to see that,\" Wiffen said. \"But it did come out of me, and it's obviously just a special moment. I've never heard that national anthem from an Olympics before.\"\n\nWiffen surged past Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri on the final lap, looking as fresh as he did at the beginning of the grueling race. He won in 7 minutes, 38.19 seconds, overpowering defending Olympic champion Bobby Finke (7:38.75) of the United States and Paltrinieri (7:39.38).\n\nMona McSharry won bronze for Ireland's first medal of these Games on the previous night in the 100 breaststroke.\n\n\"I was dying the last 20 meters,\" Wiffen said. \"I'm not sure if you saw that, because my arms are in absolutely so much pain. But I knew that the crowd is gonna carry me in, and that's exactly what happened. Then I saw the red light on the block, and that was it.\"\n\nUntil these Olympics, Ireland's swimming history was essentially confined to Michelle Smith de Bruin, who surprisingly claimed three golds and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics amid suspicions she was doping.\n\nShe later received a drug ban that essentially ended her career, but she kept her medals.\n\nWiffen was not asked about Smith de Bruin as he huddled with reporters, primarily Irish who were not looking to spoil a special night.\n\n\"To be honest -- it's going to sound really weird to say -- I've dreamt of this moment so many times in my head, I've gone over it so many different ways of how it was going to happen,\" he said. \"But to be fair, I didn't think I was going to do it in the 800 because it wasn't my favorite. I prefer the longer distance.\"\n\nSo, get ready for his shot at another Irish medal on Sunday -- and more tears.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_wade@hjnews.com", "name": "Stephen Wade", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorio_Paltrinieri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gregorio Paltrinieri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanterre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/hjnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/ba/1ba76a8d-3978-5cdc-9938-f88763e6125a/66a96f35bb800.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Better than that, he swims the swim on the greatest of all stages.\n\nDaniel Wiffen, ladies and gentlemen. Ireland's first Paris 2024 gold medalist.\n\nWiffen became Ireland's first ever male Olympic pool finalist on Monday. He is now Ireland's first ever male Olympic gold medal winner, reaching and touching first in a dramatic 800m Freestyle final at the La Defense Arena.\n\nREAD MORE: Mona McSharry targets more Olympic glory on back of landing first Irish medal\n\nREAD MORE: Meet Daniel Wiffen, the Magheralin world champion with Olympic dreams, a twin brother and Game of Thrones past\n\nHe told us that he would break the Olympic record in the final, then went ahead and did it, taking the lead at halfway then losing it with 200m to go, only to regain it again from the Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri.\n\nIt wasn't over. The reigning champion, Bobby Finke of the USA, has a fast finish and found a late surge.\n\nBut Wiffen has been like the Terminator in this raucous arena, reeling in his rivals and eliminating them mercilessly. There was only going to be one winner as the block surged into view.\n\nAmidst the roars of acclaim that followed the 6'3\" Magheralin machine eventually - calmly - emerged from the water, then declared himself as one of the best ever in the sport before he shed a tear as he stood on the podium and the national anthem played.\n\nThen, after posing for photos with the tricolour wrapped around him, he joyously greeted his family before a quick lap of honour.\n\nHas Ireland ever had an athlete like Daniel Wiffen? We are not used to our Olympic hopefuls bigging themselves up the way this 23-year-old does.\n\nIt makes us a bit uncomfortable, yet there's nothing unnatural about his declarations and pronouncements. Wiffen has backed them up, using his World Championship fourth place a year ago as fuel to become a double Worlds champion in December.\n\nThat's just not how Irish people are built and yet it's how Wiffen is built. His progression since the Tokyo Games, when he made his Olympic debut, has been astonishing in terms of lopping great chunks of national records and yet he made his improvements on a consistent level.\n\nHe is just different, from that appearance with his twin brother Nathan in the famous Red Wedding episode of Game of Thrones to breaking records that Irish swimmers have never before threatened.\n\nGo back to December 2022 and the Irish Winter Championships at the Aquatic Centre in Blanchardstown.\n\nWiffen, whose main focus was the 1500m Freestyle, broke the European short course 800m record. In doing so, he broke through the glass ceiling as the first Irish swimmer to hold a European record.\n\nA few days shy of a year later, the Loughborough student broke the longest standing World short course record and Aussie Grant Hackett congratulated him for swiping him off the top spot. All of it was building to this moment.\n\nAround La Defense Arena there are no whispers of anything amiss in what he is doing. \"I would like to say that I'm probably one of the most-tested athletes in the world right now,\" declared Wiffen earlier this month.\n\n\"I'm not really surprised when you have the results that I've had and the time progressions. I hope everybody gets tested the same as I do. I'd like to say that's the case, but I don't know.\"\n\nHe's not done in Paris, either, with the 1500m and Open Water race to come. Right now, the Wiffenator looks unstoppable.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news",

That was thrilling enough as he wiped away tears standing on the podium, the Irish flag draped over his shoulders.\n\nPerhaps just as importantly, the 23-year-old Irishman is sure to pick up some new followers on his YouTube channel -- a pitch he made when asked how people can learn more about a swimmer who is largely unknown outside his country.\n\nAlso Read | Paris Olympics 2024: Olympic Triathletes Will Swim in France's Seine River After Days of Concerns About Water Quality.\n\n\"People should watch,\" Wiffen said after winning the 800-meter freestyle on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I blog every week -- show you exactly what an Olympic champion does day-in, day-out in the pool.\"\n\nAlso Read | ISL 2024-25: Mumbai City FC Announce Contract Extension of Syrian Defender Thaer Krouma Till 2025 Season.\n\nGet ready for a flood of fans, Daniel.\n\nWearing round glasses and looking studious, Wiffen cried as the Irish anthem played in La Defense Arena. He may not look the part of an Olympic champion, but his performance in the pool says otherwise.\n\nWiffen will be back later in the Paris Games, hoping to win another gold on Sunday in the 1,500 meters -- the final day of competition in the pool.\n\n\"I don't normally cry, so I really hope nobody is going to see that,\" Wiffen said.\n\n\"But it did come out of me, and it's obviously just a special moment. I've never heard that national anthem from an Olympics before.\"\n\nWiffen surged past Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri on the final lap, looking as fresh as he did at the beginning of the grueling race. He won in 7 minutes, 38.19 seconds, overpowering defending Olympic champion Bobby Finke (7:38.75) of the United States and Paltrinieri (7:39.38).\n\nMona McSharry won bronze for Ireland's first medal of these Games on the previous night in the 100 breaststroke.\n\n\"I was dying the last 20 meters,\" Wiffen said.\n\n\"I'm not sure if you saw that, because my arms are in absolutely so much pain. But I knew that the crowd is gonna carry me in, and that's exactly what happened. Then I saw the red light on the block, and that was it.\"\n\nUntil these Olympics, Ireland's swimming history was essentially confined to Michelle Smith de Bruin, who surprisingly claimed three golds and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics amid suspicions she was doping.\n\nShe later received a drug ban that essentially ended her career, but she kept her medals.\n\nWiffen was not asked about Smith de Bruin as he huddled with reporters, primarily Irish who were not looking to spoil a special night.\n\n\"To be honest -- it's going to sound really weird to say -- I've dreamt of this moment so many times in my head, I've gone over it so many different ways of how it was going to happen,\" he said.\n\n\"But to be fair, I didn't think I was going to do it in the 800 because it wasn't my favorite. I prefer the longer distance.\"\n\nSo, get ready for his shot at another Irish medal on Sunday -- and more tears.

Mandatory Credit: Grace Hollars-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSwimming events at the Paris Olympics have been witnessing intense competition and remarkable achievements among various nations. With athletes vying for glory in multiple categories, there's ample opportunity for redemption and rewards.\n\nIreland, facing stiff competition from powerhouses like the US, Australia, and Italy, found its champion in Daniel Wiffen for the 800m freestyle event. The 23-year-old swimmer, still early in his career, has already made a significant impact.\n\nIn the Men's 800m Freestyle finals at the Paris Olympics, Wiffen surged through the grueling race to claim victory. He not only secured gold for Ireland, creating history for his country but also shattered the Olympic record for the event.\n\nClocking an impressive time of 7:38.19, Wiffen celebrated his monumental win with a triumphant pose, symbolizing his dominance in the pool. While he may achieve more accolades in Paris, Wiffen's accomplishments extend beyond the swimming arena, marking him as a noteworthy figure in Irish sports.\n\nBorn in Leeds, UK, Wiffen has a twin brother, Nathan, who is also a swimmer. Nathan specializes in the 1500m freestyle category, and the brothers aspire to make waves together in the future.\n\nThe 23-year-old has participated in several national and international competitions, including the World Championships, European Championships, and the Commonwealth Games.\n\nThroughout his career as an elite swimmer, he has made a significant impact across the nation. However, Daniel Wiffen initially rose to fame for a different reason, long before swimming became a crucial part of his life.\n\nAs a pre-teen, Wiffen had a brief brush with the entertainment industry, appearing as an extra on HBO's popular fantasy series 'Game of Thrones'. While this early experience with stardom was fleeting, it foreshadowed the greater acclaim he would achieve in the world of competitive swimming.\n\nWiffen's true claim to fame came years later when he secured an Olympic gold medal and set an Olympic record, cementing his place in sports history.\n\nCurrently training at Loughborough University in England under the guidance of their Director of Swimming, Wiffen has his sights set on other events at the Paris Olympics. With expert coaching and a proven track record, expectations are high for his future performances.\n\nThe Irish swimmer, who finds his greatest support in his twin brother, is now focusing on the 1500m freestyle event. This distance is a favorite for both brothers, and Wiffen aims to secure another historic podium finish for his country.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "radha_iyer@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Radha Iyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_La_D\u00e9fense_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanterre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nanterre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loughborough University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINA_World_Aquatics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FINA World Aquatics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/666908cc-danwif.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He won his heat in 7:51.65, which was good enough to place him 14th overall but unfortunately not enough to make the final.\n\nBut he's been a different animal since then, to qualify for tonight's final, Wiffen won his heat with an impressive time of 7:41:53 to book his place in the 800m freestyle final. The Irish athlete set the fastest time across all four heats, in his heat, the Australian duo of Elijah Winnington and Sam Short raced into the lead only for Wiffen to hunt them down.\n\nMagheralin is Daniel's home, a small village between Moira and Lurgan on the border between Down and Armagh. Though their home is in Armagh, the nearest GAA club St Michael's, who Daniel played for at underage level, is affiliated to the Down County Board.\n\nA sibling rivalry with his twin Nathan has helped push Wiffen to such great heights that has seen him recognised worldwide as a swimming superstar.\n\nEach week the twins spend a combined 50 hours plus in the pool and gym and believe that skills gained now, such as time management and discipline, will last them a lifetime.\n\nBoth are currently studying computer science degrees at Loughborough University in Leicestershire, England.\n\nAside from being a champion swimmer, Wiffen also has the distinction of featuring in one of the most popular TV shows of all time, Game of Thrones.\n\nThe hit TV series was partly filmed in Belfast, with Wiffen and his twin brother having the opportunity to appear as extras in one of the series' most memorable episodes, the infamous Red Wedding.\n\nThe 7:39.19 he set when finishing fourth in last year's World Championships in Fukuoka stands as a European record.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "glen_mathews@balls.ie", "name":

He woke up, ate breakfast, and went for a swim. But in the hours before his 800-m freestyle final at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, butterflies -- or something like it -- started to set in.\n\n\"The only difference from a normal day is that I was like, sh-tting myself, honestly,\" said Wiffen after his thrilling victory at La D\u00e9fense Arena in Nanterre, France on Tuesday night. \"I've never been this nervous.\"\n\nWiffen fought off the jitters to hold on to victory, setting a new Olympic record in the event with a time of 7 minutes, 38.19 seconds. (Finally, there was some kind of record in the pool, whose shallow depth has been the subject of consternation for creating waves that may be slowing swimmers down). American Bobby Finke, the defending Olympic champ, made his typical charge in the last 50 m -- Finke is known for his finishing speed -- but Wiffen touched the wall first, barely: Finke finished with a time of 7 minutes, 38.75 seconds, just .56 seconds behind the winner.\n\nTo Wiffen, the stars were aligned for victory. His birthday, he noted after the race, is July 14 -- the same as Bastille Day. He noticed there was a storm outside the arena at 9 p.m,, a few minutes before the start of his race. \"We're renaming that storm 'Storm Daniel,'\" Wiffen told his coach.\n\nIreland is reveling in its Paris aquatic moment. Going into the men's 800 free, the country has just three swimming gold medals in its history; they were all won by Michelle Smith at the 1996 Games. Irish officials and fans were already buzzing around town thanks to the bronze won on Monday by Mona McSharry, in the women's 100-m breaststroke.\n\nWith Wiffen's win, Paris should expect even more Irish energy these next few nights. A fair number of green-clad fans have descended upon Paris. \"It's as close as we'll get to a home Games, outside of London,\" says Trish Mayon, Ireland's press attach\u00e9 for swimming.\n\nTeam USA has done less celebrating than usual at these Games. After winning a gold in the men's 4x100 freestyle relay on Saturday, and Torri Huske's 100-m butterfly victory on Sunday, the Americans have gone without first place hardware the past two nights. Team USA won three silvers on Tuesday, as Regan Smith, the world-record holder in the 100-m backstroke, finished second to her rival Kaylee McKeown of Australia, who also set an Olympic record with a time of 57.33 seconds. \"Other people's performances are completely out of my control,\" said Smith after the race. \"Kaylee is one of one. She is an absolutely incredible racer, and she knows what to do when it matters. But I'm really proud of myself.\"\n\nIn the last race of the evening, Team Great Britain fended off the United States in the 4x200 freestyle relay. In a post-race press conference, Finke attributed the relative drought to the growth of the sport around the world, and the inevitable improvement in competition that results.\n\nPlus, American swimming fans needn't grow too anxious: Katie Ledecky races in the 1,500-m on Wednesday. She owns history's 19 fastest times in that event.\n\nPlus, Wiffen's worth your cheers. Like overnight U.S. gymnastics sensation Stephen Nedoroscik, he's a nerdy-looking athlete who wears glasses. Isn't that enough to love the guy?\n\nWiffen is known for exuding confidence, which is relatively rare for an Irish athlete, according to journalists at the race. UFC heel Conor McGregor aside.\n\n\"To me, he's the most unique sports person in Ireland there's ever been, because of the way he expresses himself,\" says Michael Foley, a reporter at the Sunday Times of Ireland. \"He's very confident, very brash, not very Irish.\"\n\nBefore Tuesday night, Wiffen's claim to fame was may have been his role as an extra, along with his twin brother Nathan -- also an elite swimmer -- as an extra in the controversial \"Red Wedding\" episode of the HBO hit show Game of Thrones. (Many main characters were killed off in that episode, which aired in 2013). He'd be up for a House of the Dragon role, he says.\n\nIn swimming circles, his YouTube channel -- in which he gives a behind-the-scenes look on what it takes to be an Olympic-level swimmer -- even inspires his competitors. \"Sometimes I use it to motivate me in practice,\" says Finke.\n\nWiffen, who was born in Great Britain but grew up in Northern Ireland, in County Down, expects a warm welcome once he returns home. \"I'm sure it's gonna be massive,\" said Wiffen, when asked about the potential reaction to his win. \"I remember last Olympics, when the rowing boys pulled up with their gold, it was crazy. I mean, we'll see what happens.\" Though he's scheduled to compete in the 1,500-m freestyle, whose heats begin on Aug. 3 -- \"I'm sure there's going to be fireworks,\" he promises -- and the 10K open-water marathon swim on Aug. 9, he said he'd allow himself to celebrate tonight.\n\n\"Half the Irish team is still going to be waiting for me when I get back [to the Olympic village],\" says Wiffen. \"The dining hall has some great chocolate muffins. That's what I'll be having.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory", "type": "author", "isAgency":

You don't know how you're going to feel in the first 100.\n\n\"So really, my first part of the race was absolutely terrible. My stroke was all over the place, I was just so nervous.\n\n\"But luckily I had a good enough speed to keep it going and I was still in the race. Then my goal was to keep building.\"\n\nWiffen paid tribute to his identical twin brother Nathan, also a distance swimmer who missed out on qualification for Paris, for urging him on.\n\n\"I tell you what, the only voice I heard in the crowd was my twin brother Nathan's,\" he said.\n\n\"I've dreamed of this every day of my life.\n\n\"I know that I seem very confident on the outside, but there's always that little tiny feeling that, you know, can I do this?\"\n\nmp/gj", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They are reminders of his first experience of the big show, motivations every time he needs a shirt.\n\nHis teenage years had only ended earlier that month. The national records he set in the 800m and 1500m were mere footnotes at the back end of a swim meet where Mona McSharry's achievement in making an actual Olympic final had demanded the attention.\n\nWe talk about shaving fractions of seconds off times in the pool. Wiffen has taken a hacksaw to his - admittedly in a much longer event that lends itself to greater advances - but there is no denying the difference between then and now.\n\nHe has taken over 16 seconds off his 800m freestyle mark since. The 7:39.19 he set when finishing fourth in last year's World Championships in Fukuoka stands as a European record. He's also stripped over 33 seconds from his 1500m freestyle time.\n\nTokyo and Paris? Worlds apart.\n\n\"Completely different,\" he said on Monday shortly after dominating his 800m heat at the La Defense Arena. \"In Tokyo I was just there really [as a qualifier], and just tried to keep progressing. The past three years have been a blast for me.\"\n\nIt's in the 800 on Tuesday night where he will go for gold in what is, lets not forget, his first Olympic final. He made it there by finishing fastest of the 31 swimmers in the heats, his 7:41.53 over half-a-second better than his closest rival.\n\nHis reaction impressed more than the time. The Olympic record, set in Tokyo by Ukraine's Mykhailo Romanchuk, is just 0.25 seconds better. Wiffen emerged from the pool having recorded his third fastest time ever and then proceeded to pick holes in it.\n\nThe message was simple and without conceit: there's more to come. Better.\n\n\"We'll save that for tomorrow night,\" he said of Romanchuk's mark. There is a matter-of-factness about Wiffen that delivers searing honesty without a shred of boastfulness, or its mirror image, false modesty. He says it as he sees it.\n\nJohn Rudd, the high-performance director for Swim Ireland describes a \"binary\" type of character who will tell you what he feels and thinks, someone of boundless confidence whose work ethic has delivered improvements to his technique and his tactics and strategy.\n\n\"If he feels he can win he will tell you he can win,\" said Rudd.\n\nThe Englishman was speaking after Wiffen's 800m and 1500m golds at the 2024 World Championships in Doha at the start of the year. Five of the eight 800m finalists in Doha, Wiffen included, will line up again here.\n\nThat includes the silver and bronze medallists, Elijah Winnington of Australia and Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri. Germany's Sven Schwarz came fourth that day and another Italian, Luca De Tullio, came in seventh.\n\nBobby Finke, the American who was marked absent at the Worlds, is the reigning Olympic champion and the 2022 world champion. He recorded the fifth fastest time in the heats on Monday but his PB, 7:38.67, is the best in the field.\n\nThat's just over half-a-second better than Wiffen's. Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri's best is only 0.08 behind that, although his was set five years ago, and there are a few other names notable by their absence this time.\n\nTunisia's Ahmed Hafnaoui, who claimed gold at the 2023 Worlds in Fukuoka, is not in Paris. Australia's Sam Short, who took silver in a race where Wiffen came fourth, failed to make this final having finished one place outside the top eight.\n\nSo, talk of gold and giddiness at the thought of Ireland continuing to flex its muscles in the Olympic pool after years of treading water is valid, but there is no guarantee of that or any other step on the podium at the evening's end.\n\n\"Any medal is good,\" said Wiffen. \"It's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal, so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we've got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine, especially.\"\n\nThat's the 1500m and the 10k open water swim but there won't be any more talk of that until the 800 is come and gone with Wiffen stressing the point that any one of the eight swimmers can do something special here.\n\nHe wasn't just throwing that out there. The 23-year doesn't need a picture of the men's 400m freestyle on his wardrobe. The race, when Hafnaoui stormed to a completely unforeseen gold medal from an outside lane is tattooed in his mind.\n\nThe Tunisian was 18 at the time and 16th in the ranking entering that meet. His gold medal-winning performance made him the lowest-seeded winner in an Olympic pool since Athens in 2004. Wiffen will be keeping tabs on the full pool from his middle lane.\n\n\"I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them,\" he said.\n\nEveryone knows Wiffen now. Medal here and it will be his picture on walls all over the country.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Wiffen has become the first athlete from Northern Ireland to win an Olympic gold medal in 36 years in a thrilling 800m freestyle final in Paris.\n\nThe Team Ireland swimmer edged the USA's Bobby Finke

becomes the first Olympian from Northern Ireland to win Olympic gold for Ireland and the first Olympian from Team Ireland to win a gold medal in swimming since 1996.\n\nAfter setting the fastest time in the heats on Monday, where he said he had one eye on an Olympic record, he duly delivered in spectacular fashion.\n\nWiffen has now added Olympic gold to his 800m and 1500m triumphs at the World Championships in Doha.\n\nOn a day where the temperature in Paris hit 36 degrees, it was Wiffen who kept his cool in the biggest race of his life.\n\nAfter taking the lead at the midpoint of the race, he slipped to second with 50 metres remaining but dug deep and his finish was worthy of any Olympic medal as he passed Finke in the closing stages to touch the timing beam first.\n\nAfter stating he

I'm there to get the job done and hopefully finish it in the final. I said before, any lane has a chance. I'll be looking at everybody, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best there tomorrow night.\n\nSo what was his effort here?\n\n\"That's a tough one to say, we'll go with 95... but 100 per cent I'm the fittest I've ever been, never been in this shape before in my life.\n\nHe then added: \"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster, I was only 0.25 off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that so that would have been pretty cool to get but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal, so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine [the 10km marathon], especially.\"\n\nAfter Armagh winning the All-Ireland on Sunday, he also feels his stars are aligning.\n\n\"Yeah Armagh won, my birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day, what is it, 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\"\n\nEarlier, Ellen Walshe produced a brilliant finish to snatch fourth place in her heat of the 400m individual medley, and a spot in that final tonight (7.30 Irish time).\n\nHer time of 4:39.97 seconds placed her seventh overall, the 22-year-old from Dublin just off her best of 4:37.18, with Canada's Summer McIntosh, one of the favourites for the event, winning the heat in 4:37.35\n\nDanielle Hill also touched home in fourth in the women's 100m backstroke, and good enough to see her make the semi-final tonight too (7.57 Irish time).\n\nFor Walshe, who came to Paris ranked 15th, making the final - and joining her roommate Mona McSharry - was indeed most satisfying: \"It's a bit of a shock, I saw fourth on the board and I was like, 'Oh, I don't know', it's just a waiting game,\" she said. \"I hadn't seen the results from the heats before and once I saw it, it was such a relief.\n\n\"And Mona is my roomie, she came back at all hours this morning after recovery and physio and swim down. We had joked about hopefully us all being in the final tonight, I am so glad to join her there. I can go back to the room and we can do the exact same thing tonight. I am super excited.\"\n\nHill will also be back in the pool later on Monday for her 100m backstroke semi-final: \"What an incredible experience, the noise is just deafening, we went from Covid times, to this, so you have to soak it up as well,\" she said.\n\n\"But everything we've been working on is there, and now we've just got to utilise all the stuff I've been working on. We reset, and see it there another gear there. I'm happy to have made the semi-final, still a bit job to do. But very happy with the decision to come back this year.\"\n\nThen it's over to McSharry, who qualified for 100m breaststroke final ranked second fastest overall, and ahead of some of the best event specialists of all time, improving her Irish record to 1:05.51. And no reason whatsoever to stop thinking about that medal chance now - her final is set for 8.25pm Irish time.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_La_D\u00e9fense_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Winnington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Winnington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Hill_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Hill (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Walshe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ellen Walshe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_McIntosh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer McIntosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bastille Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Gaelic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/RVLOTPCYT7INCXVBFN3OLV3M4I.jpg?smart=true&auth=56fb5991c0038eac63d6471930e7c69a3c0e09ee51d41c2384bffdbf0f3ee1bf&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 2683, "textEnd": 2692}], "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

And he never doubted what was going to happen when he walked into the arena.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie,\" he smiled, \"I did tell everybody already what was going to happen. It's just good to see it on paper.\"\n\n\"I don't think a lot of people actually believed me that I was going to do it tonight but yeah it was incredible. I've done it - that's all I want to say!\n\n\"There was supposed to be a storm tonight at nine o'clock, I said to my coach Steve they'll have to rename that 'Storm Daniel' after the 800's done.\"\n\nAnd yet Wiffen claims nerves hindered him for the first 300m of the race, with the only voice that could calm him before the start the most familiar of all - twin Nathan.\n\n\"I was so nervous, that's the most nervous I've ever been for a race but do you know what calmed me down? I heard by brother shout for me as soon as I walked out. I heard none of the crowd - just him, and that's what calmed me down, and really levelled my head.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, there's this whole saying going around that I'm getting 'Finked' - I'm glad to say I haven't been 'Finked\" so obviously pretty happy to get my hand on the wall first.\n\n\"It feels incredible. Andrew Bree said it just as I want to say it -'lights, camera, action' - that's exactly what I did - I'm writing myself into the history books!\"\n\nThe term 'Finked' was in reference to the American's renowned fast finishes, but he had no answer as Wiffen turned on the after-burners.\n\n\"It's amazing. What's my name? Daniel Wiffen, Olympic champion... it's really good, I can't believe it.\n\n\"I want to thank my brother Nathan, my parents, my whole coaching staff in Loughborough University and Team Ireland. I couldn't have done it without anybody. I'm not alone out there. It was such a good effort.\n\n\"I'm not gonna lie, I was looking for Bobby Finke the whole time... I was 'I can't get caught last 50m. I've been training all f***ing year for this.

Being a double World Champion, that was only natural. But in the space of seven minutes, 41.53 seconds on Monday, the 23-year-old sent it a whole lot higher.\n\nWiffen came into the 800m Freestyle as a contender but ahead of the Final, at 8.02pm UK time on Tuesday night, he's the man to beat. That's due to the controlled, classy display he unleashed to win his heat yesterday, his time making him the quickest qualifier and just a quarter of a second shy of the Olympic record.\n\nWhat was more ominous for Wiffen's rivals: he was keeping something in reserve. \"It wasn't at 100 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll go with 95. You didn't see my legs come in at the end so that's where [the extra bit] is, but I was holding a good pace and am happy with the morning swim.\"\n\nWiffen has been building for years towards this peak and said it's \"100 per cent\" the fittest he's ever been. A medal won't come easy, but after a memorable weekend for Armagh, one of their proudest sons now senses he might fulfil what he has long deemed his destiny.\n\n\"Yeah, Armagh won,\" he said. \"My birthday is on July 14, Bastille Day. What is it, 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris [in their first Olympic appearance as an independent nation]? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\".\n\nWiffen is drawn in lane four in Tuesday night's Final, with his chief rivals around him: Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri and USA's Bobby Finke to his left, Tunisia's Ahmed Jaouadi and Australia's Elijah Winnington to his right.\n\nWiffen said there was \"no significance\" to having the fastest qualifying time but he's \"got a great lane to look around\" as a result. \"Any lane has a chance,\" he added.\n\n\"I'll be doing my homework, see how everybody swims it, making sure I'll be one of the best.\"\n\nHe looked majestic in his heat yesterday, coasting into the lead just after halfway and drawing clear in the third quarter.\n\n\"The time didn't surprise me at all, I actually thought I'd be a little bit faster,\" he said. \"I was only off an Olympic record and no Irishman or woman has ever done that so that would have been pretty cool, but we'll save that for tomorrow night.\n\n\"I don't know some of the names in the Final, I'll need to look out for them. I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m Final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes.\"\n\nOnly nine athletes have ever won gold at the Games for Ireland and no Irishman has ever reached the podium in swimming. He's now on the brink. \"I'll take any medal, whatever colour,\" Wiffen said.\n\nSadly, Larne's Danielle Hill will not be in Tuesday night's 100m Backstroke Final.\n\nHill finished eighth in 1:00.80 marginally slower than the 1:00.40 she swam earlier in the heats. It was outside her personal best of 59.11 and wasn't fast enough to secure her a place in the Final.\n\nMeanwhile, Matt Richards defied being in an outside lane to claim Olympic silver in the men's 200m Freestyle.\n\nRichards claimed Team GB's second runner-up spot of these Paris Games in the pool but like Adam Peaty 24 hours earlier, he was 0.02 seconds adrift of the winner -- Romanian sensation David Popovici.\n\nDuncan Scott, who won silver in the event at Tokyo 2020, finished fourth in a frenetic finish, just 0.08 secs adrift of bronze medallist Luke Hobson.\n\nIreland's Ellen Walshe finished eighth in last night's 400m Individual Medley Final.\n\nThe 22-year-old Dubliner became only the third swimmer in Irish history to reach an Olympic Final.", "source": {"uri":

Each one is two hours long.\n\n\"On top of that I do three strength and conditioning sessions in the gym per week as well as two core sessions and also a circuit one.\n\n\"This is a particularly heavy training block. The minimum one we'd follow would still be ten pool sessions a week.\"\n\nHe added: \"I love the training regime and how it keeps you active all of the time.\n\n\"Even with the travelling we do for it I don't mind because you get to see all of these nice countries.\n\n\"It almost feels like we're going on holidays despite all of the work we have to put in.\"\n\nThe work has paid off and then some for Daniel Wiffen, who has emerged as a true Irish superstar in recent years.\n\nIn 2021, he competed in the men's 800m freestyle and 1,500m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIn 2022, he won a silver medal representing Northern Ireland in the 1,500m freestyle at the Commonwealth Games.\n\nThat December, he broke the European record for the 800m freestyle short course, becoming the first Irishman to hold a Euro record.\n\nThe following year would be a landmark one for the Down swimmer.\n\nHe became the 2023 European short-course champion over 400, 800 and 1,500m freestyle, the first Irish swimmer to do so.\n\nWiffen claimed U23 European gold in the 1,500m freestyle in Dublin in August, as well as silver in the 400m and 800m freestyle disciplines.\n\nFour months later, he won gold in the 400m, 800m, and 1,500m at the European Championships.\n\nHe warmed up for the 2024 Olympics in the best way possible, by winning gold in the 800m and 1,500m freestyle at the World Championships in February.\n\nAlong with the medals, he holds a whole host of records.\n\nDaniel shattered the world record at 800m at the European Short Course Championships in December, having claimed the European record five months earlier.\n\nWiffen won the fastest 800m freestyle heat in a time of 7:41.53, his third quickest time of his career.\n\nAnd the 23-year-old is confident of a podium finish in Tuesday evening's final.\n\nWiffen said: \"Armagh won, my birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day, what is it 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris? It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine, especially.\"\n\nThere have been some hiccups along the way, however, with Wiffen adding: \"Yeah it's so good...I mean, the food in the Village is a bit terrible honestly.\n\n\"But everything else is class. I love our flat, our team atmosphere, everything.\n\n\"I just love being part of Team Ireland.\"\n\nWhile a bit of a throwaway remark, when RTE cut back to their Montrose studio pundit Earl McCarthy did pick up on that remark.\n\nHe noted that Wiffen's preparation might not be going optimally based on that complaint.\n\nBut the proof is in the...pool and so far, he looks set to justify his pre-Olympics status as one of Ireland's main medal hopes.\n\nAlong with the 800m freestyle, Daniel will be competing in the 1,500m Freestyle and Open Water 10km", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie",

The field at the Olympics is stronger than the one he competed against during that event in Qatar, meaning it was always going to be interesting to see how he stacked up against the competition.\n\nAfter this race, it's fair to say that he is well positioned to be in among the medals.\n\nWiffen produced a stunning performance in the race. He found himself behind the leader for the opening half of the swim, with his Australian opponent going out at a very quick pace in the longer distance format.\n\nThe Irishman would take control of the race from that point onwards, going on to ease to victory. His time of 7:41:53 was over a second quicker than everyone else in the field, meaning he will be in the centre lane for tomorrow's medal race.\n\nREAD HERE: Odd Paul O'Donovan Comments Drew A Cringe From Fintan McCarthy At Olympics\n\nWhile he is still just 23-years old, Daniel Wiffen certainly seems ready to do the business on the biggest stage.\n\nHis performance at the World Championships made him a household name in Ireland and he now looks on course to win the nation's first ever Olympic medal in men's swimming.\n\nSpeaking to RT\u00c9 after this morning's race, Wiffen shared his belief that he will win an Olympic medal, even if the food in the athlete's village isn't doing him any favours.\n\nVery happy. It was very close to my World Championship winning time that I only did six months ago and it felt a hell of a lot easier than that one...\n\nI can't ask for more. I love the centre lane, it's my favourite lane. We will wait and see tomorrow night, it's all about this 36-hour recovery period that I've got to get right...\n\nI expect that if anybody has got a lane in the final, anybody can win from anywhere. I will be well aware of every lane and I'm looking forward to the final...\n\nI said I wanted a medal, and I will be coming away with one eventually at some point. I just can't wait to race again honestly, I love that.\n\nI was a bit nervous kind of walking out, but after the first 100 metres I settled in nicely and felt quite good...\n\nIt's so good. I mean, the food is a bit terrible honestly in the village, but everything else is class. I love the flats, I love everything, I love the team atmosphere, it's great. I love being part of Team Ireland...\n\nI walked out and got a big cheer. I could hear people cheering my name, so there's quite a lot of Irish support here.\n\nI'm really looking forward to the final, because I hear that a lot of people coming.

That was thrilling enough as he wiped away tears standing on the podium, the Irish flag draped over his shoulders.\n\nPerhaps just as importantly, the 23-year-old Irishman is sure to pick up some new followers on his YouTube channel - a pitch he made when asked how people can learn more about a swimmer who is largely unknown outside his country.\n\n\"People should watch,\" Wiffen said after winning the 800-meter freestyle on Tuesday night. \"I blog every week - show you exactly what an Olympic champion does day-in, day-out in the pool.\"\n\nGet ready for a flood of fans, Daniel.\n\nWearing round glasses and looking studious, Wiffen cried as the Irish anthem played in La Defense Arena. He may not look the part of an Olympic champion, but his performance in the pool says otherwise.\n\nWiffen will be back later in the Paris Games, hoping to win another gold on Sunday in the 1,500 meters - the final day of competition in the pool.\n\nGold medalist Daniel Wiffen, of Ireland, poses for a photo with his national flag on the podium following the men's 800-meter freestyle final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Nanterre, France. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\n\"I don\u00b4t normally cry, so I really hope nobody is going to see that,\" Wiffen said. \"But it did come out of me, and it's obviously just a special moment. I've never heard that national anthem from an Olympics before.\"\n\nWiffen surged past Italy\u00b4s Gregorio Paltrinieri on the final lap, looking as fresh as he did at the beginning of the grueling race. He won in 7 minutes, 38.19 seconds, overpowering defending Olympic champion Bobby Finke (7:38.75) of the United States and Paltrinieri (7:39.38).\n\nMona McSharry won bronze for Ireland's first medal of these Games on the previous night in the 100 breaststroke.\n\n\"I was dying the last 20 meters,\" Wiffen said. \"I\u00b4m not sure if you saw that, because my arms are in absolutely so much pain. But I knew that the crowd is gonna carry me in, and that\u00b4s exactly what happened. Then I saw the red light on the block, and that was it.\"\n\nUntil these Olympics, Ireland's swimming history was essentially confined to Michelle Smith de Bruin, who surprisingly claimed three golds and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics amid suspicions she was doping.\n\nShe later received a drug ban that essentially ended her career, but she kept her medals.\n\nWiffen was not asked about Smith de Bruin as he huddled with reporters, primarily Irish who were not looking to spoil a special night.\n\n\"To be honest - it\u00b4s going to sound really weird to say - I\u00b4ve dreamt of this moment so many times in my head, I\u00b4ve gone over it so many different ways of how it was going to happen,\" he said. \"But to be fair, I didn't think I was going to do it in the 800 because it wasn't my favorite. I prefer the longer distance.\"\n\nSo, get ready for his shot at another Irish medal on Sunday - and more tears.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nGold medalist Daniel Wiffen of Ireland reacts after receiving his gold medal for the men's 800-meter freestyle final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Monday, Tuesday, July 30, 2024.

Just he did everything he was going to do. It was just brilliant.\"\n\nHis dad Jonathan said: \"Stroke after stroke, we were watching him, we're watching the board, we're watching the time, we're watching each other. We're sort of saying how are the others doing?\"\n\nHe added: \"By the last 150 metres, we were all on our feet. All the people around us were cheering Daniel on and shouting for him in the stadium. It was absolutely amazing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McMillan's brother Leo said the fact he did not get his medal on the podium did not take away from his amazing performance in the heat.\n\n\"He really didn't have any nerves and neither did I going into it, I just have full confidence in him,\" he told Radio Ulster.\n\n\"I thought he was going to do really well and he did. We were absolutely ecstatic last night and even this morning. I'm just so proud of him. Obviously, it would have been nice to see him stand on the podium, but the performance itself in the heat was amazing. And he really did put on a show.\"\n\nStormont First Minister Michelle O'Neill and deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly have congratulated both swimmers while Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tanaiste

This is where media interviews are conducted, and every competitor is expected to stop if requested.\n\nReporters mostly congregate along national lines, and it's not common for an Irish athlete to attract attention from beyond the press from these shores.\n\nOne exception has been in rowing, where their status as defending champions makes the men's lightweight doubles of Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy international news.\n\nAnother was in the La Defense Arena, shortly after midday here in Paris yesterday.\n\nThe swimmers from the last of the four heats in the men's 800m freestyle were coming through in dribs and drabs, and the Irish written press were waiting for Daniel Wiffen to finish his broadcast interviews.\n\nWe were soon joined by American journalists, eager for any tidbit they could gather about Wiffen. There were reporters there, too, who were servicing the official Olympic media service, which dispatches quotes and reports to all media here, and which is relayed by news agencies around the world.\n\nWiffen is big news in the world of swimming, a place where the biggest nations traditionally hold sway.\n\nThat was immediately apparent on arrival at the venue yesterday morning.\n\nThe La Defense Arena is stunning, a remarkable footprint containing sport and business facilities to the west of Paris. It is enormous, with an IFSC-type commercial area to one side. If a company built an indoor arena containing a sports stadium beside the IFSC in the Dublin docklands, you would have an approximation of this place.\n\nRacing 92 have their home here and, in an Olympic-inflected twist, they left the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir for here. That was the stadium used for the Paris Olympics of 1924.\n\nThe Arena and all areas around it were packed with fans yesterday morning. Americans and Australians predominated, reflective of how dominant those countries are in swimming.\n\nThere were plenty of Chinese visitors, too, but when Ellen Walshe, Danielle Hill and Wiffen took to the pool on their turns, clusters of tricolours appeared.\n\nThe noise was terrific, but when any French entrant appeared, it hit new levels.\n\nSwimmers often maintain that they don't hear the noise when they are competing. They are hearing this.\n\nThe place nearly came apart on Sunday night when home star Leon Marchand won gold in the men's 400m individual medley. 'I always said before that I never hear the crowd when I'm swimming; that one I could hear 100 per cent,' said Wiffen.\n\n'There were a lot of Irish support. I saw a lot of tricolours in the stand, so pretty happy.'\n\nHe had good reason to be after a display in the heats of the 400m individual medley that saw him finish as fastest qualifier.\n\nComing after his world record-breaking and world titles of recent months, it makes him a firmer favourite to take Ireland's first gold tonight.\n\n'I was more nervous than I was before the World Championships, but that's just the Olympics, a different kind of level,' he said.\n\n'But I dealt with it quite well. A bit nervous around the first 100m, but then I settled in.'\n\nHis ambitions for tonight are also helped by the failure of one of his main rivals to make the final. As well as Wiffen, Sam Short of Australia and America's Bobby Finke were regarded as the main contenders, but Short missed out.\n\nWiffen's strong performance means he gets lane four in tonight's final (8.02pm).\n\nThe advantage of a central lane is the perspective it gives of swimmers on either side.\n\n'I'm a middle swimmer,' he said. 'I like to hold a fast pace no one else can hold. I don't know some of the names in the final, I'll need to look out for them; I'm not going to make the mistake in the 400m final in 2021 when some of them won from outside lanes.'\n\nHe wished Ellen Walshe and Mona McSharry well in their finals last night, but his evening was to be spent off his feet after a 'good feed', and then studying the opposition.\n\nWiffen is the subject of fevered anticipation at home, and it's striking to see him figure so prominently in discussions within the sport, too.\n\nIreland has no rich tradition of swimming. There's plenty of contentious history, of course, but there is not the kind of immersion in and understanding of the sport that there is in other places.\n\nA trip to an Olympic swimming event is a riotous introduction to its status. The colour and the noise may be found at other disciplines, too, but under a closed roof the environment is greatly heightened.\n\nThere is severe doubt about whether boxing will make the roster in Los Angeles in 2028, which feels unthinkable given its place in Irish history.\n\nIt is dispensable at the Olympics the way all but a handful of sports are and, along with athletics, swimming is one of the immovable anchors of the Games.\n\nThe progression of Walshe and McSharry to finals, the excellent performance by Danielle Hill in getting to a semi-final, and of course Wiffen's startling promise are helping us to understand that a little better.\n\n'Completely different,' Wiffen said of the build-up here compared to the 2020 Games.\n\n'In Tokyo I was just there really, qualified and just tried to keep progressing.\n\n'The past three years have been a blast for me, improving by 15 seconds in the 1500m every time I swam in the water, PB-ing in every international.'", "source":

I've done it - that's all I want to say! \"I was so nervous, that's the most nervous I've ever been for a race but do you know what calmed me down - I heard by brother shout for me as soon as I walked out. I heard none of the crowd - just him, and that's what calmed me down, and really levelled my head.\" \"I'm not going to lie, there's this whole saying going around that I'm getting 'Finked' - I'm glad to say I haven't been 'Finked\" so obviously pretty happy to get my hand on the wall first.\"\n\nThe last athletes from Northern Ireland to win Olympic gold were Stephen Martin and Jimmy Kirkwood, who were part of the winning Team GB hockey team at Seoul in 1988.\n\nWiffen is the first individual gold medallist from Northern Ireland since Mary Peters triumphed for GB in the pentathlon at Munich in 1972.\n\nOnly an hour after Wiffen's success another Northern Ireland swimmer secured a gold medal.\n\nWhile Jack McMillan did not participate in the Olympic 4x200m freestyle final that was won by Team GB swimmers Matt Richards, James Guy, Tom Dean and Duncan Scott, the 24-year-old from Co Down still secured a medal having swum for the team in the qualifying heats.\n\nStormont First Minister Michelle O'Neill and deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly congratulated both swimmers.\n\n\"This is truly a momentous occasion for Daniel and for local sport,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\n\"Not only has he secured NI's first Olympic gold medal in 36 years, it is also the first medal of the Games for our athletes and he set a new Olympic record. It was a fantastic performance by the @TeamIreland swimmer.\"\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris described Wiffen's performance as \"masterful\".\n\n\"On behalf of the entire country, hoarse from screaming at their televisions and computer screens, I would like to send our absolute admiration and congratulations to Daniel Wiffen,\" he said.\n\n\"Daniel, you did it - Olympic gold and an Olympic record.\n\n\"The 800-metre freestyle final in Paris was one for the ages and Daniel's technique, power and grit under pressure confirms him as a once-in-a-generation athlete. He's a world champion and now an Olympic champion, and it was our privilege to witness it.\n\n\"This is a family affair and I can only imagine the joy of Rachel, Jonathan and Nathan this evening. This is your victory too.\n\n\"Congratulations Daniel, we can't wait to see what you do next.\"\n\nDeputy premier Micheal Martin described Wiffen's win as an \"outstanding performance\".\n\n\"A breathtaking race and a new Olympic record,\" he said.\n\n\"What an achievement for Daniel and his family.\"\n\nRichard Archibald, interim chief executive officer of Sport NI, said: \"After a 36-year wait Daniel Wiffen is bringing an Olympic gold medal home to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"At Sport NI we are immensely proud of Daniel and his achievements.\n\n\"We are proud to have supported Daniel at the start of his career through our National Lottery funded athlete award. His progress over the last few years has been incredible, with European and World titles as well as a coveted world record and now an Olympic record.\n\n\"He is an inspiration to us all and I am sure his win will encourage many young people across Northern Ireland to try their hand at swimming. With two more events to come the sky is the limit for Daniel and we wish him all the very best.\"\n\nOn McMillan's achievement, he added: \"Jack played an integral role in the team securing their spot in tonight's final with the fastest qualifying time.\n\n\"At Sport NI we are proud to have supported Jack's journey to success through our Sport NI Sports Institute and National Lottery-funded Athlete Award.\"\n\nWiffen's victory came a day after Sligo's Mona McSharry clinched a dramatic Olympic bronze medal for Ireland in the final of the women's 100m breaststroke.\n\nCatch up with the latest UTV

You don't know how you're going to feel in the first 100.\n\n\"So really, my first part of the race was absolutely terrible. My stroke was all over the place, I was just so nervous.\n\n\"But luckily I had a good enough speed to keep it going and I was still in the race. Then my goal was to keep building.\"\n\nWiffen paid tribute to his identical twin brother Nathan, also a distance swimmer who missed out on qualification for Paris, for urging him on.\n\n\"I tell you what, the only voice I heard in the crowd was my twin brother Nathan's,\" he said.\n\n\"I've dreamed of this every day of my life.\n\n\"I know that I seem very confident on the outside, but there's

Finke of the United States to grab victory by 0.56 seconds.\n\nFollowing the win, the BBC got themselves in some hot water with a social media post about Wiffen.\n\nThe BBC Sport account posted on X saying: \"History in Paris!\n\n\"Daniel Wiffen becomes the first athlete from Northern Ireland to win an Olympic gold medal since 1988.\"\n\nThe post got some backlash from fans, who pointed out that Wiffen was representing Ireland and draped in the tricolour following his victory.\n\n\"News to me that there's a northern Irish team in the Olympics,\" replied one fan.\n\nAnother replied: \"No country called Northern Ireland at the Olympics lads.\"\n\nA third added: \"Pointlessly antagonistic, he's representing Ireland.\"\n\nIt's definitely not the most controversial thing the BBC have put out on the topic, however, it definitely could have been worded better.\n\nBorn in in Leeds, Wiffen moved to Magheralin, on the Down Armagh county border, at the age of two and possesses both British and Irish nationality,\n\nHe represents Ireland at the Olympic, World, and European levels, but has represented Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games.", "source": {"uri": "sportsjoe.ie",

jokes about Catholics in the northeastern United States.\n\nThe event saw an Irishman, Daniel Wiffen, take gold, an American, Bob Finke take silver, and an Italian, Gregorio Paltrinieri, take bronze.\n\nSo when the trio of flags were hoisted, it did not take long for jokes to come flooding in on social media.\n\n'Average Catholic school on the East Coast,' wrote one person on Twitter.\n\nAnother added: 'THE DEPARTED (2006)', in reference to the epic crime thriller movie set in Boston that focuses on Irish-Italian relations in the US and features Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg.\n\nThis trio of flags set off a series of tweets about Catholics in the northeastern United States\n\nDaniel Wiffen of Ireland (centre) pipped Bob Finke (left) and Gregorio Paltrinieri (right) to gold\n\nWiffen became the first Irishman to win gold in swimming at an Olympics\n\nOne fan was thinking exactly the same thing, writing: 'WORLD NEEDS PLENTY A BARTENDERS!!' - a famous line from the movie.\n\nOne viewer went along the same lines as they posted: 'BROOKLYN (2015),' a romantic film starring Saoirse Ronan who plays a young Irishwoman Eilis Lacey moving to the New York borough looking for work in the 1950s before she meets Italian-American Tony Fiorello.\n\nLacey is then told at a dinner with Fiorello's family by his younger brother that Italians don't like the Irish as they battled for jobs and housing in the US.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the three nations stood side-by-side on the podium, and the joke was not lost on one X user as they wrote: 'As an Irish-Italian (ex) catholic in new jersey... yeah.'\n\nMeanwhile, one viewer simply saw the image of the three flags and claimed: 'This is brilliant!!'\n\nInside the pool, it was a thrilling battle between Wiffen, Finke and Paltrinieri that went down to the final few metres.\n\nJokes were made about the relations between the Irish and Italians in the US after Tuesday's race, with one fan referring to the movie 'Brooklyn' that stars Saoirse Ronan (pictured)\n\nWith 100 metres to go it looked like Italy were set for the third gold medal in swimming when Paltrinieri took the lead, but Wiffen came storming back to touch first in a new Olympic record time.\n\nWiffen, who hails from County Armagh, became the first male swimmer from Northern Ireland to win an Olympic gold medal for Ireland.\n\nIt was also Ireland's first gold medal in the pool since 1996.\n\nHe stood at the top of the podium as Amhran na bhFiann - the Irish national anthem - played at a men's swimming event for the first time, and he could be back there again over the coming days.\n\nWiffen is due to compete in the 1500m freestyle and the open-water swimming event in Paris.\n\nUSA's Finke, who won gold in the 800m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics, had to settle for silver this time around after an impressive final 50 metres, while it was bronze for Paltrinieri - who nabbed silver behind Finke in Tokyo just three years ago.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The family had spent the night celebrating with staff from Swim Ireland.\n\nThe Wiffens said they woke on Wednesday to numerous messages of congratulations from family, friends and acquaintances. \"We're only getting to see them now, so it's making me very emotional,\" said Ms Wiffen.\n\nThe family had been \"quite calm\" during the race, she said. The atmosphere was \"electric\" but at about the 400m stage she admitted she had \"a bit of a wobble\" and she did not know how the race was going to go. \"I knew it was going to be close.\" The last race that his parents had attended was in Doha when Daniel won in the World Championships after leading comfortably for much of the race. \"As a parent, that's the best position to be in, because you just know when they're that far in front, it's definitely going to be a win.\"\n\nWhen the whole family embraced Daniel after his win, Ms Wiffen said she told her son that they were very proud of him. She said she had been surprised at the weight of the Olympic medal.\n\n\"I would have been happy with a medal of any colour, but deep down we wanted gold.. He was quite clear in his interviews [before the race] that he wanted gold. You don't go into a race to lose.\"\n\n[ Ireland united in joy: Daniel Wiffen's Olympic gold reaches across the divideOpens in new window ]\n\nIt had been a very special moment when Sarah Keane of Swim Ireland presented the medal to Daniel. \"She turned around and gave us a big wave. So that was a very special moment, too, for her, Daniel, the family.\"\n\nThe best moment for Jonathan Wiffen was when Daniel and his twin Nathan embraced after the win. \"It was just lovely.\"\n\n\"They are very, very close. I know Nathan and Daniel speak when they're not together, almost hourly on FaceTime, and he speaks with his other brother and sister as well, quite regularly.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swim Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/3JVWZKT4VF5WXTW2CITEMXM5SQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=025a1e2889b5446ee99c024c0abdcc6170733a203c8000ffe4b8c4abcf3be158&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Now I can say I am one of the best ever.'\n\nSpeaking poolside, a jubilant Wiffen added: 'I don't think a lot of people actually believed me that I was going to do it tonight, but yeah, it was incredible. I've done it - that's all I want to say! I was so nervous, that's the most nervous I've ever been for a race but do you know what calmed me down? I heard my brother shout for me as soon as I walked out.\n\n'I heard none of the crowd, just him, and that's what calmed me down, and really levelled my head. I'm not going to lie, there's this whole saying going around that I'm getting \"Finked\" - I'm glad to say I haven't been \"Finked\", so obviously pretty happy to get my hand on the wall first.\n\n'It feels incredible. I'm writing myself into the history books!'\n\nWiffen - under coach Andi Manley at Loughborough University, where he is studying - became the first Irish man in history to win an Olympic swimming medal. Later he shed tears on the podium as Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann rang out in La D\u00e9fense Arena.\n\nSeconds after his triumph, hundreds of supporters took to social media to congratulate him, including T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin. 'Outstanding performance by Daniel Wiffen to win gold for Ireland this evening,' he said. 'Have just arrived in Paris and delighted to catch the race with our embassy team and sports administrators.'\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris said: 'On behalf of the entire country, hoarse from screaming at their televisions and computer screens, I would like to send our absolute admiration and congratulations to Daniel Wiffen. Daniel, you did it - Olympic gold and an Olympic record. The 800metre freestyle final in Paris was one for the ages and Daniel's technique, power and grit under pressure confirms him as a oncein-a-generation athlete.\n\n'He's a world champion and now an Olympic champion and it was our privilege to witness it. This is a family affair, and I can only imagine the joy of Rachel, Jonathan and Nathan this evening. This is your victory too.'\n\nWiffen's Olympics are not over, as he is going for another gold in the 1500m freestyle.\n\nAnd Ireland could soon have another medal in the bag, with 2020 gold winner Kellie Harrington set to fight on Thursday in a last-eight boxing match in which she can secure at least a bronze.\n\nThe Dubliner continues takes on the Colombian Angie Valdes Pana. Boxing fans will be able to watch a special screening of the fight at the Diamond Park Basketball Court in Dublin 1 from 4.30pm today.\n\nYesterday was another action-packed day of highs and lows for our Irish Olympians, who strove to make their country proud. In rowing, Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch booked their place in the final of the men's double sculls, taking place on Thursday.\n\nDoyle, from Belfast, said the race took a toll on his body, and that 'if your body isn't hurting coming through an Olympic semifinal, you're not doing it right'.\n\nThe pair are up for the main event on Thursday morning where they face reigning world champions Netherlands, Spain, Romania, New Zealand and the United States in the race for the gold.\n\nAt the canoe slalom, Kildare paddler Noel Hendrick advanced to the K1 semi-final, ranking 19th overall. The 26-year-old finished in a time of 90.68 seconds, with just one penalty for touching the fifth gate.\n\n'I had to put down the fastest run that I possibly could so it was freeing in a way, but also I just attacked all the way to the bottom and I'm really pleased,' he said afterwards.\n\nHowever, the Irish men's hockey team were left dejected after suffering their third loss in Paris.\n\nDespite making 13 shots during the 60-minute game, Mark Tumilty's men simply could not get the ball past India's star goalie PR Sreejesh, losing 2-0.\n\nHowever, all is not lost for the Irish side as they still have an opportunity to reach the quarterfinals, providing they beat Argentina on Thursday and New Zealand on Friday.\n\nIn boxing, Meath's Jennifer Lehane, 25, met a very experienced Chinese fighter on her Olympic 54kg debut, and ultimately lost 5-0 to Yuan Chang. However, she said the experience will only drive her on further.\n\n'I've never fought before as many people before in my life and in such an amazing venue,' she said. 'To hear so much support coming from the crowd was just incredible and I'll be forever grateful for that experience alone.'", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"},

Before Monday, the last Olympic gold medals won by competitors from the North had come courtesy of Jimmy Kirkwood and Stephen Martin, part of the Great Britain team that won gold in hockey at the Seoul Olympics in 1988.\n\nDeputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly was quick off the mark on X. \"Amazing!! Well done Daniel Wiffen - Northern Ireland's first individual gold since Lady Mary Peters in 1972! (and from Lagan Valley too!) What a result!\"\n\nBBC Northern Ireland warmed to the theme, also on X. \"36 years of waiting is over Daniel Wiffen wins gold in the 800m freestyle final. The first athlete from Northern Ireland to win Olympic gold since 1988.\"\n\nWiffen's victory came on the same day as Belfast swimmer Jack McMillan won gold with Team GB in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay.\n\nThe North's First Minister Michelle O'Neill reached across the divide to congratulate both athletes. \"An historic day at the Olympics for local athletes, as Daniel Wiffen from Armagh and Jack McMillan from Belfast both win gold medals in swimming.\"\n\nArmagh has waited more than 22 years for sporting success and suddenly there was an All-Ireland and an Olympic gold medal within two days.\n\nArmagh GAA's official account reflected the ecstasy in the county. \"ARMAGH GOES GOLD AGAIN Here Daniel Wiffen's twin can be seen watching the Armagh game on Sunday before watching his brother grab Gold at the Paris Olympics today!! Well done to Daniel Wiffen! The pride of Armagh (past pupil of St Pat's Armagh) & Ireland along with our county players.\"\n\nSt Patrick's Grammar School in Armagh city has seven of the senior football squad who returned the Sam Maguire for the first time in 22 years.\n\nWiffen himself finally settled the argument as to whether he was from Armagh or Down by saying after winning gold. \"What can we say?

Their diligence and time management and application just can't be questioned,\" he said.\n\nThere is a \"great sense of pride\" around the twins at St Patrick's, where eyes are \"firmly\" on Paris as Daniel prepares for the 800m freestyle final and his 1500m freestyle heat.\n\n\"They are great kids. We're very, very proud of them,\" Mr Clarke said. \"We facilitated them as best we could, but their rise in swimming is down to their own dedicated and huge support from home, from their club, from the school.\n\n\"Swimming would be very much a minority sport in schools, but the two boys definitely raised it to a higher level, people would have been aware they were breaking Irish records even when they were at school.\"", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2010_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Women's_800_metre_freestyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming at the 2010 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's 800 metre freestyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ulster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magheralin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magheralin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Magheralin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Level", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A-Level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aquatic_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Aquatic Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Football Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINA_World_Aquatics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FINA World Aquatics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Freestyle_Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking/Freestyle Walking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The only other gold won by Ireland in an Olympic pool came at Atlanta in 1996 when Michelle Smith collected three.\n\nWiffen, also the first Irish male swimmer to win a medal of any colour, could not hide his emotions when the national anthem played as he stood on top of the podium.\n\n\"I don't normally cry, so I really hope that nobody's gonna see that,\" he said.\n\n\"But, yeah, it did come out of me, and it's obviously just a special moment.\n\n\"I've never heard that national anthem at an Olympics before, and it's just crazy to say that it was me standing on a No. 1 podium here for the first time.\"\n\nWiffen, who also won the 800m at the World Championships in Doha in 2024, came home ahead of American defending Olympic champion Bobby Finke (7:38.75) and Tokyo silver medallist Gregorio Paltrinieri (7:39.38) of Italy.\n\nHe took control at 400m after Australia's Elijah Winnington went out hard but tired and was reeled in. Paltrinieri made at a move at 600m and led to the final turn before Wiffen came roaring back to rewrite history.\n\n\"My first part of the race was absolutely terrible. My stroke was all over the place, I was just so nervous,\" he said.\n\n\"But luckily I had a good enough speed to keep it going and I was still in the race. Then my goal was to keep building.\"\n\nThe Irishman paid tribute to his identical twin brother Nathan, also a distance swimmer who missed out on qualification for Paris, for urging him on.\n\n\"I tell you what, the only voice I heard in the crowd was my twin brother Nathan's,\" he added.\n\n\"I've dreamt of this every day of my life. I know that I seem very confident on the outside, but there's always that little tiny feeling that, you know, can I do this?\"\n\nIn other events, Australian Kaylee McKeown crushed Regan Smith to extend her reign over the 100m backstroke, while Great Britain capped the night session on Day 4 by retaining their men's 4x200m freestyle relay crown.\n\nBritain's late triumph was their first gold medal of the Paris swimming meet and condemned the United States to a second straight day without a title. Instead, the Americans had to settle for minor medals in all three events.\n\nMcKeown's strong back-end pace made the difference again as she mowed down Smith and American bronze-winner Katharine Berkoff to retain her own 100m title in an Olympic record time of 57.33sec.\n\nIn the relay the quartet of James Guy, Tom Dean, Matthew Richards and Duncan Scott then kept the gold medal in British hands, beating the Americans by 1.35sec, with Australia taking the bronze.

The family had spent the night celebrating with the staff from Swim Ireland.\n\nFollowing their late night, the family had awoken to numerous messages of congratulations from family, friends and acquaintances.\n\n\"We're only getting to see them now, so it's making me very emotional,\" added Ms Wiffen.\n\nThe family had been \"quite calm\" during the race, she said. The atmosphere was \"electric\" but at about the 400m stage she admitted she had \"a bit of a wobble\" and she did not know how the race was going to go. \"I knew it was going to be close.\"\n\nThe last race that his parents had attended was in Doha when Daniel won in the World Championships where he had been far in front.\n\n\"As a parent, that's the best position to be in, because you just know when they're that far in front, it's definitely going to be a win.\"\n\nWhen the whole family embraced Daniel after his win, Ms Wiffen said she told her son that they were very proud of him. She said she had been surprised at the weight of the Olympic medal.\n\n\"I would have been happy with a medal of any colour, but deep down we wanted gold. He was quite clear in his interviews (before the race) that he wanted gold. You don't go into a race to lose.\"\n\nIt had been a very special moment when Sarah Kane of Swim Ireland presented the medal to Daniel. \"She turned around and gave us a big wave. So that was a very special moment, too, for her. Daniel, the family.\"\n\nThe best moment for Jonathan Wiffen was when Daniel and his twin Nathan embraced after the win. \"It was just lovely.\"\n\n\"They are very, very close. I know Nathan and Daniel speak when they're not together, almost hourly on FaceTime, and he speaks with his other brother and sister as well, quite regularly.\"\n\nThe Principal of St Patrick's Grammar School in Armagh has told of his delight at the haul of medals by former pupils in recent days with Daniel Wiffen's gold at the Olympics and seven past pupils were also members of the All-Ireland winning Armagh football panel.\n\n\"Sport plays a very, very big part in the school. And this is definitely a big, big lift for the whole school community and in the city and all around. So we're over the moon. We're very, very happy,\" he told RT\u00c9 radio's Morning Ireland.\n\nMr Clarke said that Daniel Wiffen's Olympic medal win was a \"just reward\" for all the efforts he and his twin Nathan had put in since they were teenagers. A number of years ago they participated in an interview for the school during which they stated their ambitions to go to the Olympics.\n\n\"I look forward to digging that interview out again to present that to the two boys because now here we are. A new reality has set in. And not only is Daniel Olympic champion, he's also Olympic record holder. And as he said himself, there's more to come.

I was looking for Finke all the time, I was looking over at Bobby Finke but I was not losing last 50 metres, I've been practising for that all year. Now I can say I am one of the best ever.\"\n\nWow, what a race that was! Might have been closer than he thought but he had another kick in the final 50 metres. Absolutely brilliant.\n\n7:38.19 for Wiffen. A stunning Olympic record and personal best. The fifth fastest time ever. Stunning.\n\nThrilling finish here between Wiffen, Paltrinieri, Wiffen and Finke! It's 0.10 in the difference with 50m left. Wiffen goes, kicks and takes the lead! 25 metres left. Finke goes for it. But Wiffen has it!\n\nGOLD FOR IRELAND! DANIEL WIFFEN! OLYMPIC RECORD\n\nWiffen first, Finke second and Paltrinieri third.\n\nAfter 700m: Paltrinieri goes ahead. Wiffen is 0.78 behind.\n\nAfter 600m: Wiffen still leads! Barely. Paltrinieri makes his move to second and is looking strong. It's neck and neck. 0.01 in the difference.\n\nAfter 400m: Wiffen takes the lead! 0.07 ahead of Finke, Winnington fading.\n\nAfter 300m: Strong start by Winnington, Wiffen moves ahead of Jaqouadi into second place. Only 0.79 behind. Finke up to third.\n\nAfter 100m: Wiffen third as Winnington leads from Jaqouadi. +1.19 behind.\n\nWiffen comes out looking confident, making a gesture of writing something on his hand. Ready to go!\n\nAustralia's Kaylee McKeown wins the women's 100m breaststroke ahead of the two Americans. Brilliant Olympic record time.\n\nThis was how they qualified for the 800m freestyle final:\n\nThe world record was set in 2009 by Zhang Lin with 7:32:12. Wiffen's has the ninth fastest time of all-time with 7:39:19.\n\nIn 2021, Bobby Finke took the gold with 7:41:53, beating Paltrinieri.\n\nUSA win the gold in the team competition in gymnastics. Italy the silver and Brazil the bronze.\n\nBiles is truly a modern Olympics legend, Ian O'Riordan met another one before Daniel Wiffen's race. He tips Wiffen to win! Let's hope Michael Phelps is right.\n\nA Hollywood finish for Simone Biles in the team event now, last out and her usual stunning routine!\n\nComing up in under an hour now is Daniel Wiffen in the 800m freestyle in the pool. A real gold medal chance after qualifying first into the final and winning the world championship earlier this year. Should he do it, it would only Ireland's 12th ever gold medal, and only the second ever gold in swimming.\n\nThe women's team gymnastics is on now with Simone Biles starring for the US team and there is more good news for the Americans as they finish third in the Rugby Sevens after beating Australia in the bronze medal match. I don't think anyone expected Australia to lose to Canada and USA and miss out on a medal after beating Ireland, but there you go.\n\nCanoe slalom/kayaking: In the men's kayak single heats, Noel Hendrick finished 19th after his two runs, putting him through to Thursday's semi-final. The 26-year-old improved on his 98.64 from the first round to get home in 90.68.\n\nEarlier, Michaela Corcoran finished 21st in the women's slalom C1, clocking 129.55 in the first run and 168.08 in the second.\n\nRugby Sevens: Ireland lose 28-12 to Great Britain in the women's sevens. They finish the tournament in eighth place.\n\nStadelmann wins five points in a row! It's 20-15 now, Darragh has made a few sloppy errors.\n\nAnother point for Stadelmann and she wins 21-15. Darragh beaten unfortunately. Had a great opportunity there but just slipped away.\n\nIt's 15-15 now, back and forth between the two.\n\nIt's 10-10, Stadelmann hitting a great smash and this is going down to the wire.\n\nDarragh takes an 8-5 lead, but again is pegged back to 8-7. But stays ahead 9-7 with some good play.\n\nAn early 5-3 lead for Darragh in the deciding game, but Stadelmann gets it back to 5-5.\n\nNeck and neck again, 21-21. Fantastic rally and Darragh hits a high lob and just sneaks in. 22-21. But Stadelmann wins the next two points and back to game point at 23-22. The Swiss woman wins the game 24-22. One game all! Best of three.\n\nGreat stuff by Darragh, who goes 18-16 behind, but then gets back to 18-18. Darragh lets one go and it's in, could be costly at 19-18, Stadelmann goes long again, 19-19.\n\nDavid Gorman logging on here.\n\nBadminton: Rachael Darragh has won the first set of her match against Jenjira Stadelmann of Switzerland. In the second set she trailed for nearly all of the second set but now it's back level, 16-16!\n\nThank you for your company. David Gorman will keep you well informed for the rest of the blog. He'll tidy up any outstanding Irish interest in the afternoon's fare, the Canoe Slalom, Rugby Sevens and Badminton. And of course he'll be on hand for Daniel Wiffen's medal race tonight.\n\nSAILING: Robert Dickson and Se\u00e1n Waddilove's excellent Olympic regatta in the men's Skiff class continued with a fourth place finish in race seven, 13th in race eight and then ninth in the last race of the day to leave them maintain their second place in the overall standings from yesterday.\n\nSAILING: Robert Dickson and Se\u00e1n Waddilove's excellent Olympic regatta in the men's Skiff class continued with a fourth place finish in race seven, before a 13th place in race eight dropped them from second to third in the overall standings with one further race to come today.\n\nRUGBY: Canada advanced to the gold-medal game in the Women's Sevens at the Paris Olympics with a stunning 21-12 upset win over second-ranked Australia - the Aussies beat Ireland twice in the tournament - at Stade de France. Charity Williams, Asia Hogan-Rochester and Piper Logan scored tries for the fifth-ranked Canadians, who also stunned world number three France in the quarterfinals.\n\nTop-ranked New Zealand defeated the United States 24-12 in the other semifinal. Ireland, who lost to France 19-7 earlier to day will take on GB at 5.0pm, Irish time for seventh and eighth place.\n\nEQUESTRIAN\n\nAbigail Lyle made her Olympic debut in the Dressage Individual Grand Prix on board Giraldo, at the picturesque Palace of Versailles venue, and scored a brilliant 69.441 to finish sixth in her group, but it wasn't enough to progress to the individual final.\n\nLyle and 13-year-old Giraldo; affectionately known as 'Arty', were almost foot perfect throughout their routine, and the result meant a sixth place finish in Group B. However it wasn't enough for the Bangor rider to qualify for Sunday's final, but nonetheless Lyle was over the moon with the performance.\n\nLyle said: \"I had expectations - I wanted a comfortable, happy horse to do himself proud and take him home to look after him for the rest of his life but here we are, with an amazing ride, in an amazing stadium, and I just can't fathom it. He was so comfortable in there - we both went into some sort of zone.\n\n\"I've been very emotional over the last few days, sometimes nervous, sometimes overwhelmed but I've reminded myself that I'm so lucky to have such an incredible horse and such an incredible team around me. Everything went according to plan, maybe with the slight exception being the halt, but the main content of the test, I was delighted with.\"\n\nBelfast's Philip Doyle and Clonmel's Daire Lynch are through to the final of the Men's Double (M2x) after an impressive showing in their semi-final this morning. In a time of 6:13.14, Ireland are top seed going into the final.\n\nLynch said: \"We knew we were in a good position coming in but you don't really know where other countries are at, and like we didn't win a single race until Worlds last year so we're showing good signs I suppose that we've timed it fairly well. Obviously the last block before we came here was probably our best one yet so hopefully we can just bring that in to the final now.\n\nDoyle added: \"It went pretty much the exact way we thought it would go, we did what we wanted to do, we executed well. We're knew there would be a couple that would go off like the clappers at the start, and sure we knew they'd go off like that and if they're going to go off and do silly things they're going to pay for it later so you just have to be confident that we are going to make them pay. We just have to watch because obviously the six lads in the final might not pay too hard so we need to not let them get too much and then work our way through again.\"\n\nDoyle and Lynch are up for the main event on Thursday morning where they face reigning world champions Netherlands, Spain, Romania, New Zealand and the United States in the race for the medals.\n\nThe Women's Double (W2x) of Zoe Hyde and Alison Bergin miss out on the medal race, failing to push into the top three positions in today's semi-final. They crossed in fifth which sees them into the B Final where they will race for 7-12 place.\n\nAfterwards a disappointed Bergin said: \"We've been preparing for a long time for this and we were just taking every race as it comes so yeah we're disappointed but we'll just look forward to the next race now. We'll re-assess later, sit down and look at the race and make a news strategy for the next day.\"\n\nThe Women's Four of Emily Hegarty, Natalie Long, Eimear Lambe and Imogen Magner also fell short on picking up a place in the final with a fourth-place finish in the repechage. With only two boats to qualify to the final, Ireland will race for final placings (7-12) on Thursday.\n\nBOXING\n\nMeath's Jennifer Lehane met a very experienced Chinese fighter on her Olympic 54kg debut and ultimately lost 5-0 to Yuan Chang in the last 16, but said the experience will only drive her on further. The Ashbourne native has only been boxing at international level for a few seasons after switching from elite Taekwondo five years ago.\n\n\"I thought the first round was close and that I came more into myself in the second. I was a bit more relaxed and the shots flowed a little bit more but overall I think she got the better of me today,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\nChang had incredibly fast fists and won every round unanimously on the judge's scorecards for a 5:0 victory but the Irish fighter, who could hear the travelling fans chanting her name, gave everything right to the last bell.\n\n\"It was just an incredible experience overall to come out to such a huge crowd. I've never fought before as many people before in my life and in such an amazing venue. To hear so much support coming from the crowd was just incredible and I'll be forever grateful for that experience alone.\n\n\"All my crazy family were there. They all came over to support me here and I know there was loads of support from my home town of Ashbourne and the school I worked in (St Mary's), where I know the kids were looking up to me, so I hope I have been able to inspire a few more to follow their dream.\"\n\nLehane put her primary school teaching career on hold to train fulltime with Ireland's elite boxers and indicated that she would like to continue that in future, with some occasional substitute teaching.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nIreland Men's Hockey suffered a 2-0 defeat to the Tokyo Olympic bronze medallists India in their third Pool match. Harmanpreet Singh scored a first-half double to give India an early lead at the historic Yves-du-Manoir Stadium, and although Ireland created a number of goal-scoring opportunities, the world number five ranked side held firm to see out the win. Mark Tumilty's Ireland side now have a rest day on Wednesday ahead of Thursday's clash with Argentina at (12.15pm Irish time), before they conclude the Pool stages against New Zealand on Friday at 4.0pm, Irish time.\n\nMen's Kayak: Noel Hendrik lies in third place after the first eight competitors in the first of two runs. He had 10 penalty points after hitting five gates. His second run comes later this evening.\n\nRUGBY: Women's Sevens semi-final: New Zealand 24 USA 12. The Olympic champions are one match away from retaining their crown.\n\nSAILING: Robert Dickson and Se\u00e1n Waddilove's excellent Olympic regatta in the men's Skiff class continued with a fourth place finish in race seven, the first of three today. The Irish crew lie in second place overall.\n\nIreland led 7-0 through an Eve Higgins try at halftime but three second half tries allowed the hosts to cruise home. They will contest fifth and sixth place, Ireland seventh and eighth, those matches taking place this evening. They take on GB who beat them in the opening match of the tournament.\n\nRUGBY: France now lead Ireland 14-7 with two minutes remaining.\n\nRUGBY: France have scored a converted try and with four minutes left they are level with Ireland, 7-7\n\nFull-time: Ireland 0 India 2\n\nA much improved second half performance but Ireland were left to rue a first 30-minutes that lacked energy and intensity, and perhaps after the break their failure to convert even one of 10 penalty corners. Mark Tumilty's side play their final two matches on Thursday and Friday.\n\nRUGBY: The Ireland women's Sevens lead France 7-0 at half-time. Railway Union's Eve Higgins continued her rich vein of form with the try and conversion having scored all of Ireland's points in the pool match against Australia. The Irish side lost to the Aussies again, this time in the quarter-final and are currently competing for a place in the fifth and sixth team playoff.\n\nHalf-time: Ireland 7 France 0\n\nCanoe Slalom: The 21-year-old Michaela Corcoran hit five gates, each a two second penalty, in her first run in the C1 class. 18 of 21 will qualify for the semi-finals.\n\nHockey: Ireland's second half performance has been appreciably better but they still can't find a way to score.\n\nHockey: A glorious chance for Ireland to reduce the deficit but Ben Walker flicks a shot wide with teammate John McKee free and facing just a tap-in if Walker had been aware of his presence.\n\n44 mins: Ireland 0 India 2\n\nHockey: Ireland finally manage a shot of note through Lee Cole from a short corner and from two ensuing penalty corners they also failed to score. It's been much better from Ireland in the third quarter.\n\nIreland 0 India 2\n\nSwimming: Siobh\u00e1n Haughey, a grandniece of former Irish Taoiseach Charlie Haughey, became the only athlete from Hong Kong to ever win three Olympic medals after claiming the bronze in women's 200-metre freestyle at the 2024 Paris Olympics. One of those to congratulate her was Irish T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin. He tweeted that it was \"a fantastic result\" and a \"proud day\" for the Haughey family.\n\n23 mins GOAL: Indian captain Harmanpreet Singh gets his and his team's second goal. Three penalty corners in succession and from the third his shot took a deflection off Ben Walker and into the roof of the net. It's ridiculously hot at Stade Yves du Manoir and that won't help Ireland who need to find more, a lot more.\n\nIreland 0 India 2\n\nHockey: Ireland head coach Mark Tumilty has given the team a rocket, exhorting them to be proactive not reactive and reminding them that they are representing their country. He pointed to the need to chase the runners and that they have to have more energy and discipline. He emphasised the fact that they were better in the last seven minutes of the quarter.\n\nHockey, 11 mins, GOAL: Ireland concede a penalty, Shane O'Donoghue forced into the foul. Harmanpreet Singh the scorer. India full value.\n\nIreland 0 India 1\n\nHockey, 7 mins: It's all India from the opening whistle, Ireland giving away frees by the bucket load as they can't get out of their own half.\n\nLehane: \"I did well in the first two rounds, the second round was my best. The overall experience of the Chinese fighter was (key). I am only young and there is a lot more to come from me. It has been an amazing experience here. I have had amazing support. Thank you every single one of them. I hope people are inspired to follow their dreams.\"\n\nBoxing: Chang continued to dominate, heavier of hand in her punching but also a sharp technician, dominating the centre of the ring. Lehane was gutsy and can be proud of her effort, five years after taking up boxing. She just came up against a better fighter. Chang wins.\n\nBoxing: Lehane looked less nervous at the start of the second round and settled into her work nicely, her footwork excellent and a sharper snap to her punching. Chang though continued to catch the Irish girl with the more powerful shots. All five judges go for the Chinese boxer.\n\nBoxing: Ireland's Jennifer Lehane has lost the first round on all five judges' cards (10-9). Yuan Chang beat the Irish girl to the punch in the early stages of the fight, her two-inch reach advantage apparent. The Chinese boxer utilised her experience and ring craft to dominate the round.\n\nBoxing: Jennifer Lehane is on her way to the ring.\n\nCame across this graphic while waiting for the Jennifer Lehane fight. Irish swimmer Ellen Walshe's race as an animated graphic.\n\nBoxing: Ashbourne schoolteacher Jennifer Lehane got a bye in to the last 16 of the 54kg division. She faces China's two-time Asian Games champion Yuan Chang in the 54kg division and is due in the ring in about 15 minutes.\n\nFor those that missed it here is Ireland's Olympic bronze medalist Mona McSharry's charming post race interview last night.\n\nRowing: Our man Denis Walsh is at the rowing. Here's what he has had to say. \"Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch reached the final of the men's double sculls with an impressive win in theiri semi-final, comfortably holding off crews from the United States and New Zealand in the closing 200 metres. However there was no joy for Zoe Hyde and Alison Bergin who finished fifth in the semi-final of women's double sculls, or the women's four, who came fourth in their repechage.\n\n[ Olympic final awaits Irish duoOpens in new window ]\n\nRowing: The Irish four of Emily Hegarty, Eimear Lambe, Natalie Long and Imogen Magner finish a disappointing fourth in their repechage race. The Irish boat was in third place behind the winners America and China for most of the race but they faded and were overtaken by the Danes in the final 50 metres. The top two crews made the Olympic final.\n\nRowing: Emily Hegarty, Eimear Lambe, Natalie Long and Imogen Magner are the Irish four. They are third after 1,000 metres.\n\nRowing: The Ireland women's four are at the start line for their Repechage race to see if they can get into the top two for a place in the Olympic final.\n\nRowing: Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch win their men's double sculls semi-final. Cool, calm, collected and commanding. A superb display of race rowing. That's all the alliteration I've got. The Irish pair are into the Olympic final.\n\nRugby: The Ireland women's Sevens team take on France in the first of two matches to compete for fifth to eighth place after last night's quarter-final defeat. Having lost captain Lucy Rock earlier in the tournament, the Irish squad could be further depleted after B\u00e9ibhinn Parsons limped off in the Aussie game. Allan Temple-Jones squad face France this afternoon.\n\nRowing: The Irish crew are in the second semi-final in about eight minutes.\n\nRowing: Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch are next up in the men's double sculls semi-final, having been impressive winners in their heat. Philip is in his second Olympics.\n\nRowing: Tralee's Zoe Hyde and Alison Bergin of Fermoy finished fifth in the women's double sculls. The Irish boat was never really in contention after falling off the pace a little in the second 500 metres. New Zealand won the race, Netherlands were second and France third. The Irish crew were fourth in the world championships last year in which they finished ahead of the New Zealand and French boasts, albeit that the French boat was a different pair.\n\nRowing: Zoe Hyde and Alison Bergin in the women's double sculls, are fifth through the first 500 metres and retain that position through 1,000 metres. The need to finish top three to qualify for the Olympic final.\n\nSailing: Robert Dickson and Se\u00e1n Waddilove lie in second place as the Men's skiff event reached the halfway stage of the Paris Olympic regatta in Marseilles. The Dublin pair were overall leaders going into the final race of yesterday thanks to earlier fourth and second places.\n\nThey placed eighth in the third race of the day. The light winds faded while New Zealanders Isaac Kale McHardie and William McKenzie took their third race win to move into the overall lead of the event.\n\nThe Irish crew hold a nine-point lead over the next placed crew, Spain's Diego Botin le Chever and Florian Trittel Paul. They undertake three more races today.\n\nSpeaking of required reading Denis Walsh spoke to Finbarr Kirwan.\n\n[ Finbarr Kirwan is the most powerful Irish person in the wide world of sport.Opens in new window ]\n\nIan O'Riordan witnessed Mona McSharry win a bronze medal, Ireland's first of many, hopefully, in Paris.

Darragh; a niece of three-time Irish Olympian fellow badminton player Chloe Magee, has a current world ranking of 82.\n\nFollowing Liam Jegou's brilliant seventh place finish in the C1 final yesterday canoe slalom teammates Michaela Corcoran and Noel Hendrick get their 2024 Olympic Games underway in the first and second runs of the Men's K1, and Women's C1, respectively.\n\nIreland's men's hockey team face a match approximating to a win-or-bust - it's not strictly that - after defeats to Belgium (2-0) and yesterday, Australia (2-1). There were aspects of the performance against the Aussies that were first class, especially in the second quarter and they'll need to replicate that against the Tokyo bronze medallists India at lunchtime (12.15).\n\nIn Equestrian Abigail Lyle's Olympic debut begins in the Dressage Individual Grand Prix on board Giraldo, at the picturesque Palace of Versailles venue. Lyle is Ireland's only dressage competitor and will bid to qualify for the Individual Final (Freestyle to Music). The top two athletes from each group and the six athletes with the next best scores (including ties) will qualify to the Individual Final (Grand Prix Freestyle).\n\nHello and good morning, John O'Sullivan here. I am rehydrated and ready to go.\n\nFollowing Mona McSharry's historic bronze medal last night, Ireland's double world champion Daniel Wiffen will attempt to win his first medal of the Olympics when he goes in the final of the 800m freestyle. The Armagh man is the fastest qualifier for that final on a time of 7:41.53 from yesterday's heats.\n\nThree of the Irish rowing crews are back on the water tomorrow morning aiming to make it into their respective Finals. The men's and women's doubles must finish in the top three of their semi-finals to gain a spot in the final, and a tight top two finish is needed for the women's four in the repechage of their event.\n\nMalachy Clerkin wrote: \"First up, Zoe Hyde and Alison Bergin go in the women's double sculls at 9.50am. Philip Doyle and Daire Lynch, the men's double sculls pair who probably had the most eye-catching display of all the Irish crews in the heats.

The family had spent the night celebrating with the staff from Swim Ireland.\n\nFollowing their late night, the family had awoken to numerous messages of congratulations from family, friends and acquaintances.\n\n\"We're only getting to see them now, so it's making me very emotional,\" added Ms Wiffen.\n\nThe family had been \"quite calm\" during the race, she said. The atmosphere was \"electric\" but at about the 400m stage she admitted she had \"a bit of a wobble\" and she did not know how the race was going to go. \"I knew it was going to be close.\"\n\nThe last race that his parents had attended was in Doha when Daniel won in the World Championships where he had been far in front.\n\n\"As a parent, that's the best position to be in, because you just know when they're that far in front, it's definitely going to be a win.\"\n\nWhen the whole family embraced Daniel after his win, Ms Wiffen said she told her son that they were very proud of him. She said she had been surprised at the weight of the Olympic medal.\n\n\"I would have been happy with a medal of any colour, but deep down we wanted gold. He was quite clear in his interviews (before the race) that he wanted gold. You don't go into a race to lose.\"\n\nIt had been a very special moment when Sarah Kane of Swim Ireland presented the medal to Daniel. \"She turned around and gave us a big wave. So that was a very special moment, too, for her. Daniel, the family.\"\n\nThe best moment for Jonathan Wiffen was when Daniel and his twin Nathan embraced after the win. \"It was just lovely.\"\n\n\"They are very, very close. I know Nathan and Daniel speak when they're not together, almost hourly on FaceTime, and he speaks with his other brother and sister as well, quite regularly.\"\n\nThe Principal of St Patrick's Grammar School in Armagh has told of his delight at the haul of medals by former pupils in recent days with Daniel Wiffen's gold at the Olympics and seven past pupils were also members of the All-Ireland winning Armagh football panel.\n\n\"Sport plays a very, very big part in the school. And this is definitely a big, big lift for the whole school community and in the city and all around. So we're over the moon. We're very, very happy,\" he told RT\u00c9 radio's Morning Ireland.\n\nMr Clarke said that Daniel Wiffen's Olympic medal win was a \"just reward\" for all the efforts he and his twin Nathan had put in since they were teenagers. A number of years ago they participated in an interview for the school during which they stated their ambitions to go to the Olympics.\n\n\"I look forward to digging that interview out again to present that to the two boys because now here we are. A new reality has set in. And not only is Daniel Olympic champion, he's also Olympic record holder. And as he said himself, there's more to come. So we're just absolutely delighted for Daniel, Nathan and all of his family. And we're very, very, very proud here.\"\n\nThe Wiffen brothers had been very diligent in their swim training and had also applied themselves to their studies, he said. They had a 5am start every day and by the time they arrived at school they had already been up for four hours.\n\nRSS\n\nSyndicated Content\n\nPublished: Wed 31 Jul 2024, 10:17 AM\n\nLast updated: Wed 31 Jul 2024, 10:45 AM", "source": {"uri": "westmeathindependent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Westmeath Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swim Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=cb34119c-c250-57f3-b4f9-6b481a117741&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99558&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

His progress over the last few years has been incredible, with European and World titles as well as a coveted world record and now an Olympic record.\n\n\"He is an inspiration to us all and I am sure his win will encourage many young people across Northern Ireland to try their hand at swimming. With two more events to come the sky is the limit for Daniel and we wish him all the very best.\"\n\nWiffen's victory came a day after Sligo's Mona McSharry clinched a dramatic Olympic bronze medal

With three golds and a bronze from the 1996 Olympic Games, Michelle Smith is arguably the most decorated Irish swimmer in history. However, her legacy is tainted -- two years after her successful Olympics, she received a four-year doping ban for tampering using alcohol to tamper with her urine samples from drug tests. In addition, it was revealed that she took androstenedione, a substance that got banned in 1997, prior to being tested.\n\nAt the Paris Olympic games, Ireland finally excised its' Smith-induced demons. First, Mona McSharry claimed bronze in the women's 100 breast and broke the Irish record for the same event in the semi-finals (1:05.51). That same session, Ellen Walshe finished 8th in the 400 IM, her first-ever Olympic final. A day later, Daniel Wiffen surged on his back half to claim Olympic gold in the 800 free, breaking the Olympic record with a time of 7:38.19 in the process.\n\nWith those medals, McSharry and Wiffen became the first Irish swimmers to medal at the Olympic games since Smith in 1996, as well as the second and third Irish swimming medalists ever. Additionally, Wiffen is now the first Irish man to win an Olympic medal. In other words, there was only one Irish Olympic swimming medalist in 125 years. And this year, there were two in one Olympic Games.\n\nAnd the crazy thing is that this may not be it for Ireland. Wiffen still has the 1500 free left to swim, where he is also a medal contender and the second overall seed. Walshe will also have the 200 IM left to swim, which is arguably her best event.\n\nNow with this new generation of Irish stars, the nation can at least partially put the past behind them to celebrate the present. And with Walshe, Wiffen, and McSharry being 22, 23, and 23 years old respectively, the future is looking very bright.", "source": {"uri": "swimswam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SwimSwam"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yanyan_li@swimswam.com", "name": "Yanyan Li", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androstenedione", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Androstenedione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Walshe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ellen Walshe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Mona-McSharry-By-Jack-Spitser-HOG00346-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Just he did everything he was going to do. It was just brilliant.\"\n\nHis dad Jonathan said: \"Stroke after stroke, we were watching him, we're watching the board, we're watching the time, we're watching each other. We're sort of saying how are the others doing?\"\n\nHe added: \"By the last 150 metres, we were all on our feet. All the people around us were cheering Daniel on and shouting for him in the stadium. It was absolutely amazing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McMillan's brother Leo said the fact he did not get his medal on the podium did not take away from his amazing performance in the heat.\n\n\"He really didn't have any nerves and neither did I going into it, I just have full confidence in him,\" he told Radio Ulster.\n\n\"I thought he was going to do really well and he did. We were absolutely ecstatic last night and even this morning. I'm just so proud of him. Obviously, it would have been nice to see him stand on the podium, but the performance itself in the heat was amazing. And he really did put on a show.\"\n\nStormont First Minister Michelle O'Neill and deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly have congratulated both swimmers while Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tanaiste

And there definitely was a sense that all is well in the world for the Irish contingent after the morning session in the pool.\n\nEllen Walshe and Daniel Wiffen are through to their respective finals, while Danielle Hill has a semi-final to look forward to. Their progression forward played at the La Defense Arena that didn't quite the have the high-voltage atmosphere that was in evidence on Sunday. Morning sessions, with heats and semis, don't quite have that same adrenaline-rush.\n\nIn the press room, Irish scribes were in contented mood as they pieced together their thoughts on three Team Ireland competitors progressing within a short period of each other. All told, there are 6,000 media professionals at the Paris Games, all of them hoping to report on good news stories. And for the Irish journos, there is much to ponder with a trio of finalists in the pool.\n\nThere's a cautious optimism around Mona McSharry, in that if can she deliver that littler bit more, a medal could be hers. As for Wiffen, the view amongst those assembled was that he is some sort of express train, heading towards gold. Optimism that is justified on the back of his world titles in February and the ease by which he won this morning.\n\n\"But don't rule out Bobby Finke\", was the assessment of Swimming Ireland's press officer Trish Mayon, still believing that the reigning Olympic champion despite being over a second slower than Wiffen in his heat, still has something left in the tank. Finke's time in the heat was five seconds slower than his best.\n\nSo finals are a different ball game then? Maybe not, if you're Daniel Wiffen. He thinks the stars are aligning. The county that he identifies with most had a lot to celebrate on Sunday.\n\nHe told the media huddle at the La Defence: \"Yeah, Armagh won. My birthday is on July 14th, Bastille Day. What is it, 100 years since Ireland competed in Paris. It just seems everything is aligning, doesn't it?\"\n\nIt also would seem that any podium finish will do for the 23-year-old, in spite of his winning time in the heats - 7:41.53 - being just 0.4 seconds off the Olympic record set in 2021 by Ukraine's Mykhailo Romanchuk\n\n\"Any medal is good, it's my first race here, it's my first time being in contention for an Olympic medal so I'll take any medal, whatever colour, and then we got another two races after this and I'm looking forward to the one in the Seine (Open Water), especially.\"\n\nEach night at the swimming will require a special ticket for some journalists to attend. An app has to be downloaded to ensure you get a seat. We could have three or four nights of finals to come where Irish are involved. And then there's Daniel's assignment on the River Seine come Friday week. Following that 10km trek should be fun.\n\nIn a few hours, Mona McSharry hits the pool in the 100m breaststroke final; a second Olympic final for the Sligo competitor. Before that Ellen Walshe goes in the 400m IM final.\n\nA first swimming medal for Ireland since 1996 and a first male medallist at an Olympics are sure to be part of the introductory pars that will be filed by journalists if things work out the way we hope in the next few days.\n\nMore contented scribes then in the press room!\n\nWatch the 2024 Olympic Games with 14 hours of televised action on RT\u00c92 and RT\u00c9 Player each day.

Members of an elite among the elite. Still only 23 years of age, what he just did on Tuesday night will overgrow the hedging of his own days and into the neighbouring gardens of years and generations to come.\n\n\"I'm writing myself into the history books,\" he said. That was the gesture as he walked out from the call room, one hand scribbling on the palm of the other.\n\nThe other seven finalists emerged with faces cut from stone, the Irishman stood out. Even then.\n\nHe did it again by winning gold in the 800m freestyle final in Olympic-record time. And he absolutely had to.\n\nThe USA's Bobby Finke and Gregorio Paltrinieri of Italy were miles inside the previous record too. That was the 7:41.28 written by Ukraine's Mykhailo Romanchuk in Tokyo three years ago. Wiffen just beat it by more again.\n\n\"I said it here before,\" he explained, \"Bastille Day is my birthday, [it is] 100 years since Ireland [first] competed [at the Games], but there was also a storm tonight at nine o'clock.\n\n\"I said to my coach Steve [Beckerleg]. I was like, 'We're renaming that storm, Storm Daniel', because that was the time the 800 was on.\"\n\nHis 7:38.19 tore more than three seconds off those numbers from 2021.\n\nThe Armagh man had 0.56 to spare on Finke who powered through, as he is wont to do on the home stretch, to take the silver without ever quite convincing he could take the top step. Wiffen was the first Irish male swimmer in an Olympic final. It goes without saying, he's the first Irish male swimmer to medal.\n\nHe sat in third for the first quarter, in second for the next, took the lead at halfway, settled back into second and up to three-quarters of a second behind Paltrinieri at one point before producing a stunning last 100 to suck all the tension from the air and allow the party to start that fraction earlier.\n\nIf it looked supremely choreographed then the truth was different. He felt nerves like never before on the night and, while his twin Nathan calmed him with a voice that somehow penetrated the stadium's din as he emerged from the call room, the occasion actually poured into his first \"absolutely terrible\" 300m.\n\nHis stroke was all over the place but his easy speed was good enough to keep him in the race. From there he built, block by block, split by split, until pushing for home. His arms screamed for clemency 20 metres out but suffered the agony long enough. An Olympic best and one second, exactly, quicker than his previous PB.\n\nWiffen had told anyone who would listen that he intended to win Olympic gold medals. Plural. He said after the semi-final that he would save the Olympic record for this final. He became a double World champion at this distance back in February, and at a 1500m freestyle version that he will compete in later this week.\n\nHe had put up all the signposts and invited everyone to follow.\n\nHis zen-like calm and certainty this past few years was reflected pre-race by his twin - himself an international distance swimmer - who had hummed and hawed for a bit when asked how the race would unfold before laying it straight. \"I don't think it's going to be a race but, who knows, we'll see, anything can happen,\" said Nathan.\n\nThe matter-of-factness of their confidence stood out before the race but emotion wouldn't stay silenced. When Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann came on, Wiffen wiped away tears and shuttered his eyes like a humming bird its wings. This wasn't a song he was accustomed to hearing at an Olympics and he had kickstarted the tune.\n\nIt feels big in all sorts of ways.\n\nIrish swimmers have been chipping away at their minnow status for years. People like Grainne Murphy and Shane Ryan worked their picks and crampons ever higher up the mountain, establishing higher base camps for others to follow. Mona McSharry's bronze in the women's breaststroke on Monday evening was another huge gain.\n\nThis last two days have felt like the culmination of one journey as Irish swimming fully emerged from all those earlier decades of mediocrity, and the beginning of another. Wiffen didn't say he had written history. He said he was writing it. There are many more chapters to follow.\n\n\"No, this is 100 per cent not the end. I'm only 23. Peak age for my event is 27, but you saw Gregorio Paltrinieri there in the last 100 and he's like 29. Who knows what's going to happen in the future? But I'm very happy today to say that I'm Olympic champion.\" The thing is, this isn't even his best race. That 1500, which he goes in later this week, is his sweet spot. A 10k open water swim lies ahead here too and he seems fully tuned in for it.

He said it calmed him, levelled his emotions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14 July is his birthday and Bastille Day. And it's been 100 years since Ireland first competed - and that was in Paris.\n\nThere was a storm due tonight at 9pm. \"We're renaming that storm, Storm Daniel,\" he told his coach earlier, remarking at the timing of his final.\n\nAnd, lastly on his list of fate, were his fellow county men who walked up the steps of the Hogan Stand just last Sunday to collect the Sam Maguire.\n\n\"What can you say, we're All-Ireland champions and Olympic gold medalists - what a great county,\" he said tonight.\n\nArmagh GAA didn't miss a beat, celebrating his achievement on X.\n\n\"Well done to Daniel Wiffen! The pride of Armagh (past pupil of St Pat's Armagh) & Ireland along with our county players.\"\n\nThere had been questions raised about the 23-year-old's county allegiances as both Down and Armagh laid claim to the talent.\n\nNot only has Wiffen himself quashed any doubts over the answer, his father was emphatic when asked by RT\u00c9 earlier today.\n\n\"Absolutely, it's Armagh. There's no doubt in my mind,\" Jonathan Wiffen told Clare MacNamara. He also revealed the family had watched the All-Ireland final in Paris last Sunday.\n\nTonight's result continues an incredible year for Wiffen, a product of the Larne Swimming Club, who has been training and studying at Loughborough University since 2021.\n\n2024 also saw the two-time Olympian become a double world champion in the 800m and 1500m.\n\nRead Next Related Reads Brilliant Biles leads USA to Olympic women's team gold An afternoon in awe of BMX Freestyle, one of the Olympics' newest -

Get one of them under your belt.\n\n\"My goal was to progress and progress and progress until I became Olympic champion.\"\n\nThat progress has been spectacular.\n\n\"I'm happy to say I've had a very good up-slope in terms of swimming,\" he added.\n\n\"We went from 14th place at the last Olympics, making a World Championships final, winning a Commonwealth medal, fourth at a World Championships, triple European champion, world record, double world champion, and now Olympic champion.\n\n\"I've won it all, what can I say?\n\n\"It's a dream come true. I mean, children dream of becoming an Olympian and I've just become Olympic champion.\"\n\nIn the crowd at the Paris La Defense Arena was Daniel's biggest supporter, his twin brother Nathan.\n\nAnd it turns out his inspiration.\n\n\"This is going to sound weird, but there were 20,000 people in this crowd, but the only voice I heard in the crowd was my twin brother. That was what kept me level-headed as soon as I walked out,\" he said.\n\n\"As soon as I heard that I knew it was a sign and I was going to win it.\n\n\"I've said in a lot of interviews that my birthday is on Bastille day and it's 100 years since Ireland [first] competed at the Olympics. There was meant to be a storm at nine o'clock, and I'll tell you what, it was the 800m freestyle.\"\n\nIt was a thrilling final with Wiffen chasing down Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri in the closing 100 metres.\n\nHe became the first male swimmer representing Team Ireland to win an Olympic medal as well as ending the long drought for an athlete from Northern Ireland to win a gold.\n\nHe may not know his history but he certainly isn't done creating his own legacy.\n\nThe 1500m freestyle heats come up on Saturday with the final on Sunday.\n\nCould it be double gold, just like earlier this year at the World Championships?\n\n\"We're not done here. Yeah, I can't wait for the 1500m freestyle, it's my favourite event.\"\n\nAs if one Olympic gold medallist wasn't enough, after waiting for so long, within an hour of Wiffen's success, Jack McMillan also became an Olympic champion.\n\nThis was a second appearance at a Games for the Bangor swimmer who competed for Ireland in Tokyo before transferring to Great Britain.\n\nMcMillan is based at the University of Stirling and trains alongside some of the very best Team GB swimmers, including his Olympic team-mate Duncan Scott, so the switch made sense.\n\nAfter finishing fifth at the Olympic trials, he was selected as a relay-only swimmer for Paris.\n\nHis job was to make sure the men's 4x200m freestyle relay team reached the final while Scott and individual silver medallist Matt Richards were either rested or were swimming other events in the morning.\n\nMcMillan did his job to perfection, in fact he swam faster than the Tokyo individual 200m freestyle champion Tom Dean.\n\nHowever, with Richards and Scott drafted back into the final line-up, McMillan had to watch as they stormed to victory, defending their Olympic title.\n\n\"The atmosphere here is just unbelievable, it's incredible,\" reflected McMillan.\n\n\"It's my first Olympics with Team GB, so I'm pretty proud of myself for getting here and obviously for the team.\"\n\nIt was a night to remember for both swimmers, and for Northern Ireland sport, but stay tuned as there could be more good news from Paris just around the corner.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

In the end, American Bobby Finke touched the wall in second.\n\nThey both held on to reach the podium, Wiffen raced atop it with a new Olympic record to boot.\n\nThe 23-year-old simulated the writing of his name for the latest inspired walkout and then cemented it in the pool. His is the tenth name engraved onto a historic list, a select few who have achieved a gold medal in Ireland's century of Olympic participation.\n\nEvery move, every stroke, every bold declaration was aimed towards this day. Wiffen went beyond delivering, conquering in 7:38:19. The boy who talked the talk did in fact walk the walk.\n\nStep-by-step he eyed the summit. From Leeds to the village of Magheralin to Loughbrough University to Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena, where he ascended to the peak.\n\nWith the support of his family, in particular twin brother Nathan, the only voice he can hear in the entire crowd pre-race. An Irish sporting sensation at the pinnacle of a global sport. Imagine.\n\nHe never saw it any other way. After all, this is a swimmer who changed his sports psychologist because they made him go over the possibility of losing a race. He couldn't contemplate such a prospect.\n\nWhen he found a new psychologist, they told him he didn't need their help. What is the difference between confidence and arrogance? Performance. That is precisely what he did.\n\n\"Amazing. I am not going to lie, I did tell everyone already I was going to do it before,\" he said afterwards. \"It was just good to see it on paper.\"\n\nIt was a night full of promise and delirium. From late afternoon on, the pool was full of dreamers. As the warmup clock counted down, a truly exceptional facility transformed into a bright phantasmagoria.\n\nIt was a stunning exhibition of light and sound, the only drawback being that there wasn't a sell-out to see it. Once more, empty seats were apparent across the stand. Top tiers were full but prime positions lay barren. Such a scale is most likely reflective of the pricing, which opened at \u20ac85 for category D and rose to \u20ac690 for category A.\n\nThis failure to pack the place out did a disservice to the displays of the theatre and its generational athletes. Miracles are only sufficiently disseminated with witnesses to spread it. Mercifully, a strong Irish cohort were present for Wiffen's coronation.\n\nBeneath the screen that announced his new record sat a host of proud Irish swimmers including bronze medallist Mona McSharry. Their roars combined with the clatter of snapping seats as everyone rose to their feet during a dramatic crescendo.\n\nThis was a night for the creation of stars. A chance to watch the cosmic event that creates gold in the flesh. Hometown hero Leon Marchand took to the pool 15 minutes before Wiffen in the semi-final of the men's 200m butterfly. His parents are former Olympic swimmers Xavier Marchand and C\u00e9line Bonnet. His coach is Michael Phelps's former mentor Bob Bowman.\n\nBy the third length, every pull was celebrated with a Ol\u00e9, like football supporter's hurrahing every pass against an outclassed opponent. His quest to become the first swimmer to win butterfly and breaststroke medals at one Games continues. History's hand was reaching out to all of Paris. Wiffen then emerged and beckoned it closer.\n\n\"I am surprised, I don't think a lot of people believed I was going to it today,\" he declared. \"Incredible. I said it. I done it.\"\n\nHe was the last to walk out. He was the last to remove his tracksuit. He was the last man to succumb to the fatigue that comes with such a taxing discipline. Elijah Winnington was the early leader only to finish in eighth.\n\nAt the midway point, Wiffen started to push but it was still knee-rattlingly close. It's not like his eventual triumph was sudden either. His recovery after a nervy initial 300 metres, his composure in the closing push, his ability to establish and then maintain that flowing technique, elevated him above all competition. It was clutch.\n\nThe only time that steely poise cracked was on the podium. The tricolour was raised, the national anthem rang out, his lip began to twitch and his eyes blinked incessantly as if blinded by his own extraordinary stardom.\n\nDaniel Wiffen and Ireland, coming to terms with this new reality that they are now a global power in the pool.

I knew that I missed one.\n\n\"We're All-Ireland champions and Olympic gold medallists, what a great county.\n\n\"But there was also a storm at nine o'clock.\n\n\"I said to my coach Steve Beckerleg, 'We're renaming that storm, Storm Daniel', because that was the time the 800m was on.\n\n\"I have been training for every different scenario that is going to happen.\n\n\"Normally I would only train one way by holding on and burning everybody out in the middle.\n\n\"But I know the Olympics are different and you don't know how you are going to feel in the first 100 metres.\n\n\"My first 300m was terrible. My stroke was all over the place.\n\n\"I was just so nervous that I couldn't get any stroke in but luckily I had a good enough easy speed to keep it going and I was still in the race.\n\n\"Then my goal was to keep building and building\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009\"\n\nAs had happened in the heat, Australian 400m specialist Elijah Winnington had gone out hard and led for most of the first half of the race.\n\nBut Wiffen -- fourth at the 150m mark -- never panicked and had overhauled him by the midway point, with American Bobby Finke moving into second.\n\nIt became apparent that Gregorio Paltrinieri was a threat as the Italian first of all overhauled Finke and then started to eat into Wiffen's lead which was down to one hundredth of a second by the 600m mark.\n\nAnd it was no surprise when he then overtook the Armagh man and he led by 0.67 seconds at the 650m mark and 0.78 seconds with 100m to go.\n\nBut Wiffen fought back in those final two lengths and was within one-tenth of a second of the leader with 50m to go at which point he blew him away.\n\nHe finished in a time of 7:38.19, shaving more than three seconds off the previous Olympic record set by Ukraine's Mykhailo Romanchuk in Tokyo.\n\nFinke finished ahead of Paltrineri too but the fact that all three were well within the old Games record showed just what an epic race it had been with Wiffen keeping an eye on the Yank in the closing stages.\n\nHe said: \"I was literally looking at Bobby Finke.\n\n\"That's all I was doing. I was like, 'This guy comes about the fastest'\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009well, not the fastest anymore.\n\n\"I was like we need to have at least a body length on him.\n\n\"I was doing this weird lopy stroke to try to have a look.\n\n\"I was dying for the last 20 metres because my arms were in so much pain.\n\n\"But I knew that the crowd was going to carry me in and that's exactly what happened.\n\n\"I saw the red light on the block and then that was it.\"\n\nIncredibly, Wiffen admitted that this was not the event he had expected to strike gold in.\n\nOn Saturday he competes in the 1500m heats, with the final the following day, and he also plans to compete in the 10km open water swim.\n\nHe said: \"This is going to sound really weird but I've dreamed of this moment so many times in my head, I've gone over so many different ways about how it was going to happen.\n\n\"In my eyes, I didn't really think I was going to do it in the 800m because it's not my favourite event.\n\n\"My favourite event is the longer distance stuff.\n\n\"The 800m is quite a new event in the Olympics but I'm an 800m Olympic champion, it feels great and exceeded my expectations.\n\n\"My goal is obviously to be back on the podium again.\n\n\"I'll get the recovery in and I will enjoy myself.\n\n\"I will try to treat myself to whatever they have in the Village.\n\n\"I don't know what they have, and in the 1500m, get through the heats and see what happens.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_o_riordan@thesun.ie", "name":

That said, she admitted to having \"a bit of a wobble\" around the halfway mark of the race, unsure how the rest of the race was going to go.\n\nShe said the last race of Daniel's she and her husband had attended was his dominant World Championships performance Doha.\n\n\"As a parent, that's the best position to be in, because you just know when they're that far in front, it's definitely going to be a win.\"\n\nAs for Tuesday's final, she said she would have been happy \"with a medal of any colour\" but that she knew her son was going for the gold.\n\nHe was quite clear in his interviews that he wanted gold. You don't go into a race to lose.\n\nShe also said it had been a very special moment when Sarah Kane of Swim Ireland presented the medal to Daniel.\n\n\"She turned around and gave us a big wave. So that was a very special moment, too, for her. Daniel, the family,\" she told RT\u00c9 Radio's Morning Ireland.\n\nEarlier on the same programme, the principal of St Patrick's Grammar School in Armagh said past pupil Daniel Wiffen's spectacular win was the culmination of a remarkable few days which also saw seven other past pupils All Ireland senior football medals with Armagh.\n\n\"Sport plays a very, very big part in the school. And this is definitely a big, big lift for the whole school community and in the city and all around. So we're over the moon.

A new reality has set in. And not only is Daniel Olympic champion, he's also Olympic record holder. And as he said himself, there's more to come.\" he said.\n\nMr Clarke added that the entire community around St Patrick's were \"very, very, very proud\" of Daniel and his family.\n\nThe Wiffen brothers had been very diligent in their swim training and had also applied themselves to their studies, he said.\n\n\"They had a 5am start every day and by the time they arrived at school they had already been up for four hours.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivienne_clarke@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Vivienne Clarke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_heaney@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Steven Heaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swim Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's_Grammar_School,_Armagh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9 Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Armagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8456/4228096_4_articlelarge_OLYMPICS_20Paris_20203577.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

There is no gathering planned to watch the final but something might be happening on his return, Ms Hughes said.\n\nCurrently studying in Loughburough University and training as a member of their elite program under coach Andi Manley, Daniel is hoping to follow Mona McSharry on to the podium after her third place finish in the 100m breast stroke on Monday\n\nAnother Larne Swimming Club member, Newtownabbey's Danielle Hill, is also competing in the games, qualifying for the semi finals in the 100m backstroke but missing out on a final spot. She will compete in the 50m freestyle heats on Saturday, while Daniel will be focussing on the 1500m freestyle on the same day.\n\nJack McMillan, from Belfast, swims in a final this evening as a member of Team GB's 4x200m relay team.\n\nDaniel, a former pupil at St Patrick's Grammar in Armagh City, won the 800m and 1500m freestyle gold at the World Aquatic Championships in Doha in February.\n\n\"If I didn't come away with a medal I would be very disappointed,\" Daniel said ahead of the Olympics.\n\n\"Going in with the times that I've produced, with my PBs (personal bests), they would just put me on the podium if I can replicate them. I've done it time and time again so we'll just keep doing what we are doing.\"\n\nAll of the Wiffen family have travelled to Paris for the games, including twin brother Nathan who narrowly missed on Olympic qualification. Mother Rachel and father Jonathan along with siblings Ben and Beth are also in Paris.\n\nDerry McVeigh, of Silver Hatch Sports, which represents both Daniel and Nathan, said the family is incredibly close and supportive.\n\n\"Daniel will be in camp but the relationship between the members of the family is that they will be on to each other five or 10 times a day,\" Mr McVeigh said.\n\nHe added that the swimmer brings \"incredible positivity\" to the camp, that he has \"real leadership qualities\" and a \"can do it\" attitude.\n\nBrother Ben, six years older and a one time Irish 1500 metre medallist, was an early inspiration to the twins and is now a swimming coach in Enniskillen.\n\nRachel and Jonathan Wiffen, originally from Liverpool and Leeds respectively, moved to Magheralin when the twins were two.\n\nMr Wiffen spent some years working abroad so much of the work of helping to develop the twins' talent fell to their mother.\n\nWhile they were growing up, the both trained twice a day, three days a week, and once a day three other days, then with competitions at the weekends.\n\nMr Manley, Daniel's head coach at Loughborough University, said the swimmer knows how his rivals will swim and that they have covered \"all the 'what if' scenarios\" to ensure he has reached peak performance.\n\n\"Anything can happen, but in terms of what we're focusing on, it's just going to be delivering the best race possible for him,\" said Mr Manley.\n\n\"We know how his rivals will swim it. We've been talking about that a lot over the last 18 months, in terms of all the 'what if' scenarios, and how to go about that. But I think he's at a level now where he shouldn't be fearful of anyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He set himself up for what might seem like unrealistic tasks but he would go after them with a steely determination that is very rare.\n\n\"He definitely does have the mentality of someone who could be an Olympic champion, there is no doubt about that.\"\n\nMr Sheppard said children watching the Paris Olympics at home will now be looking up to Wiffen - and bronze medallist McSharry - and see the success they have found in swimming.\n\n\"It's tangible. The kids can see these people that live and breathe on the island of Ireland, who spent their formative years here and were able then to bridge across into high performance centres and be world-class athletes,\" he said.\n\nWiffen is well-placed to earn a place on the podium, with final preparations ensuring that he is in a position to \"deliver the best race possible\" in the pool in Paris.\n\nHis head coach at Loughborough University, Andi Manley, said Wiffen has studied the type of race his rivals will swim, and they have covered \"all the 'what if' scenarios\" to ensure he has reached peak performance.\n\n\"Anything can happen, but in terms of what we're focusing on, it's just going to be delivering the best race possible for him,\" said Mr Manley.\n\n\"We know how his rivals will swim it. We've been talking about that a lot over the last 18 months, in terms of all the 'what if' scenarios, and how to go about that. But I think he's at a level now where he shouldn't be fearful of anyone.\n\n\"We've done the work and he's ready to go and swim real fast. And we just need it all to happen in that seven and a half minutes on the night.\"\n\nAn occasion like an Olympic final is rare, an event so filled with emotion, pressure and expectation that many athletes can allow it to get the better of them.\n\nSpeaking on his way to Paris to watch Wiffen attempt to take home a medal, Mr Manley was confident the swimmer will \"step up\" in the arena, with a walk-out in front of 15,000 spectators \"all adding to his performance rather than taking away\".\n\n\"It has been phenomenal. He has just consistently gotten better year-on-year,\" said Mr Manley. \"He has momentum coming into this, he is a guy on an upward trajectory and it has all been part of our plan with the goals we have set along the way.\"", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Down", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Down"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisburn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisburn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lisburn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magheralin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magheralin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Magheralin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loughborough University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Terrible analysis from the @BBCSport as usual.'\n\n'OMG, can't believe I just heard Clare Balding claim Daniel Wiffen's gold medal for Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland are not in the Olympics!' user Olive posted on X.\n\n'Claire Balding and BBC at it again tonight with toxic comments declaring the amazing achievement of Daniel Wiffen from Northern Ireland and not Ireland, the country he represented,' Paul shared.\n\n'Hang on Clare Balding! You can't have Daniel Wiffen, he's Irish and the medal is for Ireland!' Nikki wrote.\n\n'Clare Balding trying to claim Wiffen as he was born in NI. He's competing for Ireland' Glynis added.\n\nMeanwhile Melanie said Clare was 'stoking the fire' with her comments while Conroy claimed the presenter was 'showing no respect' for the swimmer.\n\nBBC Sport also found itself inundated with negative responses after sharing a post following his win that read: 'Daniel Wiffen becomes the first athlete from Northern Ireland to win an Olympic gold medal since 1988.'\n\nReplying, user Clive said: 'He represents Ireland not Northern Ireland. They don't compete in the Olympics. Look at his T-shirt lads.'\n\n'Did you miss the Team Ireland bit,' Anto asked.\n\n'What anthem are they playing lads? What does it say on his top?' Conall added.\n\nLast year the national broadcaster issued an apology to Irish actor Paul Mescal for calling him British when reporting on his Oscar nomination.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who is from Maynooth, was given the nod for his leading role in indie flick Aftersun in the Actor in a Leading Role category.\n\nBut when covering the nominations, the BBC reported: '2023 Oscar nominations: British actors Paul Mescal and Bill Nighy are nominated for leading role.'\n\nIn a written apology, it later said: 'In text running across the screen we reported that Paul Mescal was one of two British actors who had been nominated for an Oscar for a leading role.'\n\n'The text should have said that Paul Mescal is Irish. We apologise for the mistake.'\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted BBC and representatives for Clare Balding for comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : What is PRK at the Olympics?

Watching from the wings was twin brother Nathan, who expected it to be a clearer win for his brother after a dramatic finish saw Wiffen just hold off defending American champion Bobby Finke.\n\n\"Maybe at 300 I was like 'oh it's a bit close here, I thought it would be way more'. But on the last 200 to 100 I was like 'ah he's got it in the bag here', because he had a good place, strategic placing in terms of who was behind him and who was in front of him.\"\n\nThe Magheralin man admitted nerves had seen him struggle to find his stroke in the opening 300m, but said the sound of Nathan's voice helped him settle into the race.\n\n\"I heard about his interview - I thought that was a pretty nice thing to say.\n\n\"I was absolutely screaming, so I hope he could hear me to be absolutely honest. To go on to the race, what they always say is champions adapt and he is Olympic champion and he adapted to win.\n\n\"That's a pretty good thing to say you're Olympic champion.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old shed a tear as Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann rang out around a packed arena, with his family following suit in the stands.\n\n\"My eyes start welling up any time I see a newspaper article or anything now,\" said dad Jonathan.\n\n\"Every time I read something or see something, my eyes start filling up. I wouldn't say I was an emotional guy, I was the same Nathan was at the European Championships and came fourth, my eyes were welling up then.\n\n\"It's just dream stuff to see your kids do so well. It's just phenomenal.\"\n\nAnd it was reward too for Jonathan and wife Rachel who, even when he was working in India for six years, ferried the twins across the country to sow the seeds for what unfolded on Tuesday night.\n\n\"There were weekends I was working in India, Rachel was up and down to Limerick for a competition, it was just everything to keep it going. Then I'd come back and Rachel would go 'you're doing mornings now', so I'd go and start work while they were swimming at five in the morning.\n\n\"Somebody said to me that they both had the chance to go an Olympics, so one of the reasons Daniel and Nathan didn't really come out [to India] was because of the swimming... I thought 'I don't want to take them out there and ruin their chance of going to the Olympics'.\n\n\"I know coaches always say that to kids, but if they've got a chance, do I want to ruin that? So I just commuted from India. It's having that determination and that strength to say 'hold on, that's what we want to do'.\n\nNext up is the 1500m heat on Saturday morning, with Wiffen planning to add a remarkable second gold to his ever-growing collection.\n\n\"Let's hope he can re-focus for that,\" smiled Nathan, \"I'll wind him in.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magheralin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magheralin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Magheralin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_McSharry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mona McSharry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhr\u00e1n_na_bhFiann", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limerick"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limerick"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.irishnews.com/resizer/v2/POCGMAHQ3NDK3E6K54PBP5TEGA.jpg?smart=true&auth=950e022c57bc5d1cf08609383be7c2bb6e30da748ff885a92538a39b0ffacb97&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

'Are you not entertained?'\"\n\nWe were. But as Andrew put it after, \"I nearly passed out - thanks Mr Wiffen.\" Did you ever see a race like it?\n\nJohn Kenny warned us from the off not to panic if Wiffen started at a leisurely-ish pace, that he'd rev it up as the race progressed, but then Elijah Winnington and Ahmed Jaqouadi took off like trains leaving our lad in third, a position he lost when Sven Schwarz overtook him. Panic? Too right.\n\n\"He hasn't gone to the legs, it's all about the arms,\" John told us, at which point the nation was hollering \"GO TO THE LEGS\" at their telly screens, and he must have heard our sage advice, because by the halfway point he was in the lead.\n\n\"DON'T DISCOUNT PALTRINIERI,\" John howled, which was daft because the Italian was nowhere to be seen. And then he tried to multiply our heebie-jeebies by pointing out that \"FINKE IS A DANGEROUS LAST 100m SWIMMER!\" Nuts, he was closer to drowning than competing for a medal.\n\nAnd then Paltrinieri took the lead and Finke was threatening to deny Wiffen even a silver.\n\nThereafter. He's some boy, this lad. He waltzed in to the arena like he was heading for a stroll in the local park, his twin Nathan reassuring Clare MacNamara pre-race that he'd be completely chilled about it all. They are, incidentally, the most identical twins known to man, calling to mind their appearance on The Late Late Show a while back. \"For all you know, I'm actually Nathan,\" Daniel said to Patrick Kielty. Which would have led you to wondering was that Nathan in the pool and Daniel cheering him on from the stands.\n\nThose last couple of pool lengths? Epic is too light a word, Wiffen's efforts belonging to the ages, utterly magnificent.\n\n\"What did we just witness,\" asked Joanne, Gr\u00e1inne laughing at the spectacle she had just witnessed, in an entirely disbelieving kind of way, Andrew with his head in his hands. \"What's going on,\" he asked, Joanne revealing that he spent the concluding spell of the race slapping his legs and Gr\u00e1inne's.\n\nHe thought the gold was gone. \"But then with about 125 to go, he bounces off the wall, ba ba ba ba, see ya!\" Which was a perfect summary of how it all ended, really. \"It was,\" said Gr\u00e1inne,\" a perfect race\", although our heart rate monitors might beg to differ.\n\nWhen Wiffen spoke to RT\u00c9 immediately after the race there wasn't a bother on him, like he never had a moment's doubt that he could do what he just did. \"Now I can say I'm one of the best ever,\" he said with the gentlest of smiles.\n\n\"Even the make-up artist upstairs said I've never met a more confident person in my life,\" Andrew laughed.\n\nMedal ceremony time. We don't get to hear Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann a whole lot at these Olympic occasions, so John was entirely lying when he said \"you're crying, I'm not crying\". The bulk of us, you'd guess, were in floods. Even the Wiffen man. He might have entered that pool knowing he would win, but the realisation that he'd done just that left him in tears.

successful day of swimming, while the women's rugby sevens team narrowly missed out on a bronze medal.\n\nAn outpouring of raw emotion - both happiness and sadness - prevailed across several venues at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games on Wednesday morning.\n\nAt a jam-packed Stade de France, Australia's women's rugby sevens team left the field heartbroken, after being defeated 19-14 by the US in the bronze medal match.\n\nStill stung from their 21-12 semifinal defeat against Canada a few hours earlier, the Australians looked to have done enough, following a try to Maddison Levi with less than 90 seconds left to play.\n\nNeeding to travel 85m to tie the game, US jet Alex Sedrick broke a tackle in the shadows of her own goalposts and raced clear to cross under the posts at the other end as time expired.\n\nWhile the Australians players fell to the turf and pondered the agony of defeat, the American players and their coach Emilie Bydwell - the only female rugby sevens coach at the tournament - came to terms with the fact following Sedrick's converted try that they had achieved something which no other US women's rugby sevens team had ever done previously.\n\nMeanwhile at the at the Paris La Defense Arena, swimming success continued for Australia and several prominent European nations.\n\nIn the women's 100m backstroke final, 23-year-old Kaylee McKeown stormed home in the final 25 metres to win gold for Australia, outlasting American duo Regan Smith and Katharine Berkoff and setting a new Olympic record, 57.33 seconds, in the process.\n\nWhile her speed played an integral part, McKeown's lunge for the wall to grab victory was equally significant, given how close her rivals were.\n\nWinning bronze was also clearly a special moment for Berkoff, also 23, given her father David is a four-time Olympic swimming medalist.\n\nTeam Ireland also has a new hero, with Daniel Wiffen claiming gold in the men's 800 metre final.\n\nIn doing so, Wiffen, who has also represented Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games, became the first male Irish swimmer to win a medal of any colour at an Olympic Games.\n\nFrom the outset, this final was absorbing.\n\nAustralia's Elijah Winnington set the pace early from lane six - although by the halfway mark, it appeared to be a race of three between Wiffen, Italy's Gregorio Paltrinieri and US talent Bobby Finke.\n\nWith Paltrinieri in his sights at the home turn, Wiffen lifted his intensity in the dying seconds to not only win but also set a new Olympic record of 7min:38sec.19.\n\nMollie O'Callaghan also continued her good form, qualifying for the women's 100m freestyle final on Thursday morning, around 2.30am WST, in lane three alongside compatriot Shayna Jack.\n\nOther Australian swimmers to keep an eye on are Zac Stubblety-Cook and Joshua Yong, who will both participate in the men's 200m breastroke final, which is scheduled around 4.30am.\n\nIn the 4x200m men's freestyle relay final, Australian quartet Flynn Southam, Thomas Neill, Max Giuliani and Elijah Winnington finished with bronze behind Great Britain and the US.\n\nAmerican gymnast Simone Biles also added to her incredible legacy, after securing her eighth medal at an Olympic Games.\n\nBiles acquired her fifth gold medal after playing an integral part in the US claiming victory in the women's team gymnastics final.\n\nOverall Medal tally (Wednesday, 6am WST)\n\nJapan (seven gold, two silver and four bronze) leads the medal table, with China in second.\n\nAustralia is in third - with six gold, four silver and one bronze.\n\nBasketball\n\nAustralia will need to defeat Greece on Friday evening at 7.30pm WST in order to push for a spot in the men's quarter finals, after falling 93-83 to Canada on Tuesday night.\n\nFootball\n\nAll men's pool matches were completed, with the biggest upset in Pool C, with Egypt upsetting Spain 2-1.\n\nThe following quarter final match ups have been confirmed and will be held over Friday night and Saturday morning at various famous football venues across France: Morocco v US, Japan v Spain, Egypt v Paraguay and France v Argentina.\n\nHockey\n\nIt was a tough outing for Australia's men's team, the Kookaburras, who fell 6-2 to tournament favourites Belgium at Yves du Manoir Stadium.\n\nTom Boon scored a hattrick for the victors, who are aiming to defend their Tokyo 2020 title.\n\nThe loss means the Kookaburras sit third in Pool B, with added importance now in terms of their next clash against New Zealand on Thursday.\n\nRugby Sevens\n\nAlthough they withstood an incredible defensive display from Canada in the women's rugby sevens gold medal match, ultimately New Zealand's class once again rose to the surface.\n\nLeading by two points with only a few minutes left and camped in Canadian territory, the 'Black Ferns Sevens' were inspired by co-captain Sarah Hirini, who broke through Canada's defensive rearguard.\n\nThis attack eventually resulted in the pacy Stacey Waaka being fed a teasing pass out wide - with her try ensuring the team could conduct a celebratory post-game haka.\n\nShooting\n\nNathan Hales took out the men's trap shooting final for Great Britain and also set a new Olympic record, hitting 48 shots out of 50.\n\nQi Ying finished with silver for China, while Australia's James Willett came sixth.", "source": {"uri":

Daniel Wiffen becomes the first athlete from Northern Ireland to win an Olympic gold medal since 1988.\"\n\nWhile factually accurate and certainly not the most offensive example of an Irish person's success being co-opted by Britain the tweet did still provoke plenty of exasperated replies.\n\nThey pointed out that the 23-year-old is very much a member of Team Ireland.\n\nThe irony of him being draped in the tri-colour while shedding tears to Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann was not lost on people either.\n\nOne reply stated: \"And he does it as an Irish athlete and Irish man. Standing under the Irish flag.\n\n\"Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann playing out. The tri-colour being raised.\"\n\nWhile another slagged the British broadcaster by quipping: \"You lads are in for some shock when you hear Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann in a few minutes (Irish flag emoji).\"\n\nSimilarly, Eoin clarified: \"Ireland, representing Ireland, not NI, not UK. Let it go, it's sad to see.\"\n\nLastly, Alan agreed: \"Irish athlete. First medal for an Irish man to win in the pool (Irish emoji).\"\n\nThe double world champion spoke of his pride of being a member of Team Ireland immediately afterwards.\n\nHe told RTE: \"I mean amazing...I mean, 'What's my name? - Daniel Wiffen, Olympic champion.\n\n\"Sorry, it's really good, I cant believe it.\n\n\"I want to thank everybody else - my twin brother Nathan and my parents, and my whole coaching staff in Loughborough - and the Irish team.\n\n\"I couldn't do it with out anybody. I'm not alone out there. That was such a good effort.\"\n\nIn an epic three-way duel, he held off the challenge of Bobby Finke - 800m and 1,500m champion in Tokyo - and Rio 1,500m gold medalist Gregorio Paltrineri.\n\nBut that should have come as no surprise as anyone who watched his walkout as he mimed scribbling in a book as he signalled what he was going to do.\n\nThe young phenom added: \"I know everybody loves to see my walk-outs.\n\n\"I wrote my name in the history books on my walk-out, and I definitely backed it up with my swim in the pool.\n\n\"What can I say? It's just amazing. I did tell everybody I was going to do it before, so it's just good to see it on paper.\n\n\"I'm just stuck for words because it's such a big achievement for me.\n\n\"I've dreamed of this every day of my life and I know that I seem very confident on the outside, but, you know, there's always a little percentage of you thinking, 'Can I do this?'\"\n\nWiffen will go again in the 1500m freestyle before dipping his toe into the 10km for the first time - once it does take place in the River Seine as he has said he doesn't want to do it outside of Paris.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_whelan@thesun.ie", "name": "Vincent Whelan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Wiffen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Wiffen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhr\u00e1n_na_bhFiann", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Armagh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Armagh"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Finke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Finke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1500_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1500 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loughborough", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loughborough"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Loughborough"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/abf00a30-55c2-4b52-895d-ea59024bfefe.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772133", "eventUri": "eng-9772133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

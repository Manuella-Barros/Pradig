Our MLB odds series has our Twins White Sox prediction, odds and pick for Monday night.\n\nIt's time to continue our MLB odds series with a Twins-White Sox prediction and pick. Find out how to watch Twins White Sox.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins started their season losing 13 of their first 20 games. They have lost seven in a row in a stretch of games removed from that initial 20-game stumble. They have lost five in a row in a third separate rut. For a team with three really bad sequences of games, one would normally conclude -- rationally, logically -- that such a team would be .500 at best and probably below break-even through 90 games.\n\nThe Twins are 51-39, in strong position for a playoff spot.\n\nMinnesota has been really bad in spots, but also dominant in other stretches. The Twins have won 12 games in a row. In a separate period of games, they won six in a row. They are currently on another roll in which they have won 10 of 14. They have had huge hot and cold spells, but the hot periods have outnumbered the cold ones. With the Kansas City Royals going 15-24 in their last 49 games, the Twins have moved several games ahead of the Royals for second place in the American League Central and into the second American League wild card position. The Twins lead the Boston Red Sox by 1.5 games for that second wild card spot, the Royals by three games. The Twins clearly have the talent to become a factor in the American League, which they were last year. The big key will be to avoid the kinds of stumbles which have emerged at times in the first 90 games. Taking care of the woefully bad White Sox is very important for the Twins, just as it is important for the other American League wild card contenders.\n\nChris Flexen (2-7) has a 5.08 ERA. He has been a weak link on a White Sox starting staff which has actually not been terrible as a whole. Garrett Crochet and Ereck Fedde have been genuinely good pitchers for Chicago this season. Flexen, though, hasn't set nearly the same standard, as his ERA indicates. Opposing teams have found him to be very hittable. His last start against the potent Cleveland Guardians exhibited Flexen's problems. He didn't give up a ton of hits, but the hits he gave up were loud ones. Two gopher balls in six innings just won't cut it. Only three strikeouts in six innings shows that opposing hitters are able to put lots of balls in play against him. He doesn't strike out a lot of batters, and his walk-to-strikeout ratio is not good at all. Pitchers have the upper hand over hitters in modern baseball because of heightened velocity and spin, but Flexen doesn't get hitters to miss his pitches and allows way too many balls in play. That's why he is such a weak pitcher right now.\n\nLast Start: Tuesday, July 2 versus the Cleveland Guardians: 6 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 2 HR, 1 BB, 3 K\n\nTV: Bally Sports North (Twins) / NBC Sports Chicago (White Sox) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nThe powerful Twins against Chris Flexen is a batter-versus-pitcher mismatch. We don't have to overthink this one.\n\nWhy The White Sox Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe Twins haven't decided on a starter, which puts Minnesota's game situation into question.\n\nFinal Twins-White Sox Prediction & Pick\n\nIt's hard to bet for the White Sox. However, you should wait until you know the Twins' starter (or choice of bullpen pitchers) for this game. Hold off until you get solid information.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_zemek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Zemek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Crochet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Crochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Extra_Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB Extra Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Twins-vs.-White-Sox-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 2777, "textEnd": 2783}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Byron Buxton raced home from third on Margot's soft groundout, and the Twins won their third straight while improving to 8-0 against the major league-worst White Sox this season.\n\nThe 23-year-old Lee made his debut last Wednesday and has jumped right in on a hot-swinging Twins team. The infielder has hit safely in all his games and is batting .458 (11 for 24).\n\n\"It's awesome. It's so fun,\" Lee said. \"I would hope I play well. I never think I'm not going to play good.\n\n\"It's just been such a special week for me and my family, too. It still feels like a blur.\"\n\nJhoan Duran (5-3) pitched a hitless 10th for the win. Kody Funderburk, the seventh Twins reliever, worked a perfect inning for his first career save.\n\nJared Shuster (1-2) allowed both runs in the 11th and took the loss as the White Sox fell a season-worst 41 games below .500 (26-67).\n\nChicago's Nicky Lopez looped a double in the eighth for his second hit and RBI of the game, tying it at 6.\n\nCarlos Correa hit a towering solo homer to cap a four-run seventh that put the Twins ahead 6-5. Correa's 12th homer followed Matt Wallner's two-run drive off reliever Jordan Leasure that tied it 5-all.\n\nTrevor Larnach also went deep as the Twins extended their team-record home run streak to 26 games.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 220-pound Wallner played his second game since his recall from Triple-A and scorched the ball to right field with a 116.7 mph exit velocity.\n\n\"I think it's as good a lineup as you see in baseball right now,\" Wallner said. \"Guys are feeling good ... and just trying to complement each other.\"\n\nBuxton had three hits and an RBI.\n\nLight-hitting White Sox catcher Mart\u00edn Maldonado smacked his third homer, and second in three games. He entered batting .101.\n\nEloy Jim\u00e9nez, the oft-injured slugger in the middle of Chicago's lineup, had two hits and drove in a run to snap a 10-game drought without an RBI. Corey Julks added an RBI double.\n\nLeasure, recalled from Triple-A Charlotte earlier in the day, was tagged for four runs and got only two outs after inheriting a 5-2 lead from starter Chris Flexen.\n\n\"I bet most of our guys did not know that was the situation for the reliever coming in,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"They're focused just on where to look and what to do with the stuff that he has. A lot of guys are falling into a good place and feeling good at the plate.\"\n\nTwins starter Chris Paddack allowed two runs and three hits in five innings after being reinstated from the 15-day injured list. The right-hander walked two, struck out three and threw 78 pitches as he came back from right arm fatigue.\n\nFlexen gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings, striking out four and walking one.\n\n\"Another really good start by our starters -- they gave us a chance to win,\" White Sox manager Pedro Grifol said. \"We had a three-run lead and we couldn't put them away, seventh inning on.\"\n\nLarnach's homer in the first put Minnesota ahead. Maldonado's shot in the third tied it at 1.\n\nThe Twins took a 2-1 lead in the fourth on doubles by Kepler and Buxton. Lopez scored on Julks' double to tie it at 2.\n\nJim\u00e9nez and Lopez had RBI singles in Chicago's three-run sixth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nTwins: Correa was back in the lineup after leaving in the first inning of Sunday's 3-2 win over Houston when he was hit on the right hand by a pitch. ... To make room for Paddack, the Twins optioned RHP Josh Widner to Triple-A St. Paul.\n\nWhite Sox: OF Tommy Pham was scratched from the lineup with a dental issue, the team said ... CF Luis Robert Jr. didn't start on a scheduled day off, but entered as a pinch hitter in the sixth.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Twins send RHP Bailey Ober (8-4, 4.12 ERA) to the mound against White Sox RHP Erick Fedde (6-3, 3.13) on Tuesday.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nCarlos Correa (finger) told reporters after Sunday's game that he expects to return to the Twins' starting lineup on Monday. Correa was pulled from Sunday's game after being hit by a pitch, but fortunately X-rays came back negative for any structural damage and he's merely dealing with a right finger contusion. If the 29-year-old shortstop says that he's good enough to play on Monday, then chances are he'll be in the Twins' lineup for their series opener against the White Sox in Chicago.\n\nLenyn Sosa went 2-for-4 in a loss to the Marlins on Sunday.

Byron Buxton raced home from third on Margot's soft groundout, and the Twins won their third straight and improved to 8-0 against the major league-worst White Sox this season.\n\nJhoan Duran (5-3) pitched a hitless 10th for the win. Kody Funderburk, the seventh Twins reliever, worked a perfect inning for his first career save.\n\nJared Shuster (1-2) allowed both runs in the 11th and took the loss as Chicago fell a season-worst 41 games below .500 (26-67).\n\nChicago's Nicky Lopez looped a double in the eighth for his second hit and RBI of the game, tying it at 6.\n\nCarlos Correa hit a towering solo homer to cap a four-run seventh that put the Twins ahead 6-5. Correa's 12th homer followed Matt Wallner's two-run drive off reliever Jordan Leasure that tied it 5-all.\n\nMinnesota's Trevor Larnach also went deep. Buxton had three hits and an RBI.\n\nLight-hitting White Sox catcher Mart\u00edn Maldonado smacked his third homer, and second in three games. He entered batting .101.\n\nEloy Jim\u00e9nez, the oft-injured slugger in the middle of Chicago's lineup, had two hits and drove in a run to snap a 10-game drought without an RBI.

The right-hander walked two, struck out three and threw 78 pitches as he came back from right arm fatigue.\n\nFlexen gave up two runs and seven hits in six innings, striking out four and walking one.\n\nLarnach's homer in the first put Minnesota ahead. Maldonado's shot in the third tied it at 1.\n\nThe Twins took a 2-1 lead in the fourth on doubles by Kepler and Buxton. Lopez scored on Julks' double to tie it at 2.\n\nJim\u00e9nez and Lopez had RBI singles in Chicago's three-run sixth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nTwins: Correa was back in the lineup after leaving in the first inning of Sunday's 3-2 win over Houston when he was hit on the right hand by a pitch. ... To make room for Paddack, the Twins optioned RHP Josh Widner to Triple-A St. Paul.\n\nWhite Sox: OF Tommy Pham was scratched from the lineup with a dental issue, the team said ... CF Luis Robert Jr. didn't start on a scheduled day off, but entered as a pinch hitter in the sixth.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Twins send RHP Bailey Ober (8-4, 4.12 ERA) to the mound against White Sox RHP

One of those things are the Minnesota Twins' bats.\n\nThose trends make for an easy decision in our free Twins vs. White Sox predictions, trusting Minnesota's offense in our MLB picks before first pitch on Monday, July 8.\n\nMy analysis\n\nBy just about any batting criteria, the Minnesota Twins rank in the Top 5 across the league. A pertinent example is their No. 3-rank in slugging percentage at .431, trailing only the Orioles and Dodgers.\n\nBy just about any pitching criteria, the Chicago White Sox rank in the Bottom 5 across the league. A pertinent example is their second-worst WHIP at 1.372, better than only the Rockies.\n\nSometimes things can be that simple. Minnesota has cleared this run total in 14 of their 26 games in the last month, with another five falling short by only the hook.\n\nChicago starter Chris Flexen owns a 4.85 ERA over his last five starts, averaging less than 5 1/3 innings while giving up a 1.50 WHIP in this stretch. This is the wrong offense to suffer that sloppiness against.\n\nFurthermore, the White Sox lack enough shutdown relief to step in when Flexen is inevitably run early from this game. Of the six relievers to throw at least 10 innings in the last month, only two have ERAs lower than 3.00.\n\nJohn Brebbia enjoys a 1.46 ERA in 12 1/3 innings in the last month, but he has thrown in two of the last three days. There is a decent chance he will not be available tonight. That would leave Michael Soroka, but after throwing three innings and 61 pitches just two days ago, he almost assuredly is not available tonight.\n\nAnd that leaves only worries in the Chicago bullpen, worries that are likely to become realities given Flexen has not pitched more than six innings in a game since his second start of the season.\n\nTwins vs White Sox same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nThese AL Central rivals played seven times by the end of May Day, with the Twins winning all seven with four of those coming by multiple runs. Two of those featured Flexen on the mound, giving up a 3.68 ERA in the 7 1/3 innings he worked.\n\nThere may be some worry about backing Carlos Correa the day after he took a pitch to the hand, but the star shortstop was adamant yesterday, \"I will be playing tomorrow.\"\n\nHe was hit in the wrist just a week ago. He happened to hit a home run the next night.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nTwins vs White Sox spread and Over/Under analysis\n\nTwins vs White Sox trend\n\nThe Twins have hit the team total Over in 26 of their last 38 games, good for a 27% return on investment.

Keep reading for our Twins vs. White Sox betting prediction.\n\nCan the Twins win the game outright as money line as road favorites?\n\nProjected starting pitchers: Bailey Ober (MIN) vs. Erick Fedde (CHW)\n\nThe Minnesota Twins are 52-39 straight up this year. Minnesota is 7-3 straight up in their last 10 games. The Twins are 43-48 ATS this season.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are 26-67 straight up this year. Chicago is 4-6 straight up in their last 10 games. The White Sox are 42-51 ATS this season.\n\nOur MLB Public Betting Information page indicates that 83% of public bettors are currently backing the Twins money line. Please note that these numbers are subject to change all the way up to game time, so be sure to check the link to ensure that you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nMinnesota Twins DFS Spin\n\nTwins third baseman Brooks Lee was one of 5 players on his club to record multiple hits in their 8-6 win over the White Sox on Monday. In that contest, the rookie from San Luis Obispo, California went 2 for 5 with 2 singles, 2 RBIs, and a run scored. Lee is off to a hot start to his major league career as he's batting .458 with a homer, 7 RBIs, and an OPS of 1.087 across 26 plate appearances this year. With Twins third baseman Royce Lewis out with an injury, Lee should have an everyday role at third base as long as he continues to hit. That makes him relevant in most DFS formats.\n\nChicago White Sox DFS Spin\n\nWhite Sox second baseman Nicky Lopez had a big day at the plate in his club's 8-6 extra-innings loss to the Twins on Monday. In that contest, the former Royal went 2 for 3 with a double, 2 RBIs, a run scored, a walk, and a stolen base. Lopez has never hit for much power (6 homers in 621 career games), but he can hit for average and steal a base. Nicky Lopez is hitting .250 with 4 stolen bases this season, and he could be worth a look in DFS if you're trying to save money on your middle infield spots.\n\nTwins vs. White Sox MLB Betting Trends\n\nMinnesota is 9-1 straight up in their last 10 games against Chicago.\n\nMinnesota is 7-2 straight up in their last 9 games overall.\n\nChicago is 2-6 straight up in their last 8 games overall.\n\nThe numbers are tilted heavily in the Twins' favor ahead of this contest. Minnesota is an MLB-best 32-19 straight up after a win this season. Furthermore, the Twins are 18-12 straight up in division games and 48-34 straight up when playing an opponent on equal rest this season. The numbers aren't as kind to Chicago.\n\nThe White Sox are 24-61 straight up when playing an opponent on equal rest and 7-24 straight up in division games this year. Both figures are the worst in baseball. With Tuesday's game being rained out, both Minnesota and Chicago got an unexpected day off yesterday. The White Sox have been bad in that scenario. Chicago is an MLB-worst 1-11 straight up when playing on 1 day of rest this season. I think the Twins take care of business on Wednesday and win this game outright on the road in Chicago.", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_becker@thespread.com", "name": "Alex Becker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Fedde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erick Fedde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MLB Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicky Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight_Edge", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight Edge", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thespread.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Brooks-Lee-Twins.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Our MLB odds series has our Twins-White Sox prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe Twins make the trip to Chicago to face the White Sox! The Twins are having a great season this year, while the White Sox have been the worst team in the MLB this season. The Twins have a lot more momentum than the White Sox leading into this matchup. Our MLB odds series has our Twins-White Sox prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up three runs on seven hits with zero walks and eight strikeouts in a Twins win.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up one run on three hits with three walks and three strikeouts in a White Sox win.\n\nThe Twins are 51-39 and have won two straight and three out of their last four games leading into this series. The Twins are just outside the top 10 in batting and are struggling with their pitching staff. Alex Kirilloff, Edouard Julien, Byron Buxton, Willi Castro, Carlos Santana, and Ryan Jeffers are some notable names on this Minnesota offense despite the struggles. On the mound, Joe Ryan and Simeon Woods Richardson are the names to watch despite the struggles they have dealt with there as a staff.\n\nThe Twins are starting Bailey Ober on the mound where he has an 8-4 record, a 4.12 ERA, and a 1.10 WHIP. He has allowed 45 runs on 80 hits with 23 walks and 100 strikeouts through 94 innings. The Twins are 9-8 in the 17 games that he's started so far this season. Ober has struggled with consistency this season where he will have one good game and then a bad game the next. He still gets a favorable matchup against an offense that has been as awful as the White Sox behind the plate this season.\n\nThe offense for the Twins has been red-hot recently. They have jumped all over the place in the rankings and are currently sixth in the MLB in team batting average at .255 after finishing with a .243 average last year. Willi Castro, Ryan Jeffers, and Carlos Correa lead the Twins in most batting categories. Correa leads in batting average at .305 and in OBP at .376. Then, Jeffers leads in home runs at 14 and RBI at 46. Finally, Castro leads in total hits at 86. This Twins offense has been red-hot recently, but they get a decent matchup against Erick Fedde on the mound for the White Sox.\n\nWhy The White Sox Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe White Sox are the worst team in the MLB. They have a 26-66 record so far this season. They have lost two straight games leading into this game and three out of their last four games. They are the second-worst team in the MLB behind the plate and are also struggling on the mound, ranking near the bottom on the mound as well. Gavin Sheets, Paul DeJong, Andrew Vaughn, and Andrew Benintendi are standouts despite how bad the offense has been. The only notable pitchers in the lineup are Erick Fedde and Garrett Crochet. They have struggled all season and do not have much hope the rest of the way.\n\nThe White Sox are starting Erick Fedde on the mound in this matchup and he has a 6-3 record, a 3.13 ERA, and a 1.13 WHIP. He has allowed 38 runs on 92 hits with 28 walks and 94 strikeouts through 106.1 innings. In his 18 starts this season, the White Sox are 7-11. Fedde has been one of the very few bright spots for Chicago this season, but this is a challenge against the Twins and how well they have played behind the plate.\n\nThe offense for the White Sox has been awful. The White Sox are second to last in the MLB in team batting average at .222 which comes after having a .238 last season. Gavin Sheets, Paul DeJong, and Andrew Vaughn lead the offense in most categories. Vaughn leads in batting average at .242, in RBI at 43, and in total hits at 77. Then, Sheets leads in OBP at .323 and DeJong in home runs at 16. They get an interesting matchup against the Twins and Bailey Ober on the mound. Ober has been inconsistent this season, but it might still be a challenge for this struggling White Sox offense.\n\nFinal Twins-White Sox Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Twins have been great recently and have the momentum. They have a much better offense when compared to the White Sox, but Fedde is the better pitcher than Ober for the Twins. Fedde is the key factor for the White Sox in this game and is why Chicago should cover at home. The Twins might still win, but Fedde is why they will cover.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Ober", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Ober"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kirilloff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Kirilloff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Fedde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erick Fedde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Buxton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Buxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ryan_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ryan (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Crochet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Crochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Sheets", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Sheets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_DeJong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul DeJong"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Twins-vs-White-Sox-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

As a team, they sit fifth in MLB in slugging percentage (.434) and home runs (111), and when their lineup is fully healthy, no pitcher wants to see them.\n\nLeading the charge this season -- both due to his consistency and health -- has been freshly selected All-Star Carlos Correa. Correa is second on the team in home runs (12) and batting average (.303) and is coming off his most successful month of the season.\n\nCorrea slashed .388/.441/.582 in June and has been just as splashy in July with three homers in seven games. Over his last 32 games, he's averaged 2.3 bases per outing and had four against the Chicago White Sox on Monday.\n\nChicago will send Erick Fedde to the mound for Round 2 against Minnesota, and he's allowed three homers in his last five starts. Fedde has four pitches in his primary arsenal with his sinker (30.9%) being his go-to.\n\nThat doesn't bode well for him against Correa, who has added a run value of five off of them this year -- his second-highest total off any pitch. And going to his second-most frequent pitch -- cutter (28.6%) -- may yield even worse results for Fedde.\n\nCorrea's got a whopping .303 xBA and .532 xSLG against cutters this season with a 56.3% hard-hit rate. However, it's breaking balls that he's been pulverizing with eight of his 12 dingers coming off them and Fedde's got a sweeper he's using 20.2% of the time.\n\nThe only other pitch the White Sox starter even really uses is his changeup (20.2%), and of all the pitches in his arsenal, that's the worst one he could go to against Correa as the three-time All-Star is batting .333 against them this season.\n\nJose Miranda has been the Twins' breakout hitter in 2024. The 26-year-old leads the team in batting average (.332) and only seems to be getting better. He's slashing a jaw-dropping .640/.667/.960 in July with 24 total bases in seven games. Miranda also happens to be batting .362 against Fedde's top pitch.\n\nIf the White Sox are going to pull off an upset against the big-swinging Twins, they'll need Luis Robert to keep crushing baseballs. In seven games in July, he's slashing .308/.400/.500, plus he has a .705 xSLG against Minnesota starter Bailey Ober's top pitch, the four-seamer.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nTwins vs White Sox spread and Over/Under analysis\n\nTwins vs White Sox trend\n\nThe Minnesota Twins have hit the Team Total Over in 47 of their last 74 games (+15.35 Units / 17% ROI).

The teams' games, while frequently dramatic and adversarial in the extreme, somehow still have the inevitability of game-speed back-field practice.\n\nThe Twins will do it till they get it right, in other words.\n\nCase in point, Monday night's matchup, in which the Twins surrendered a lead or a tie three times, endured one of the most erratic innings of their season to donate a couple of runs to Chicago, only to roll their eyes and rally with sheer power when they needed it. The result was an 8-6, 11-inning victory at Guaranteed Rate Field, the Twins' eighth in eight meetings this year.\n\n\"We'd do two positive things that were, like, fantastic. And then we'd do something not so good,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said after his team won its 52nd game, exactly twice as many as the last-place White Sox's 26. \"We were on our toes and ready. Doesn't mean we did everything right, but we were ready to play when we needed to.\"\n\nByron Buxton and Brooks Lee, who had five hits between them, each singled in the 11th inning, the latter driving in courtesy runner Max Kepler with the tiebreaking run. Buxton scored on Manuel Margot's groundout, giving the Twins, who piled up 15 hits, eight of them for extra bases, the cushion they needed to finally subdue the feisty Sox.\n\nChris Paddack did a lot of the subduing, returning to the Twins' rotation after two weeks on the injured list with five strong inning. Paddack hit 95 mph with his fastball and gave up only three hits and two runs.\n\n\"Honestly, it was a quick 15 days. But I felt great getting back out there, doing what I love,\" the righthander said. \"There were some two-strike counts where I could have maybe expanded a little bit more. But we got some weak contact. I thought we did a good job attacking that lineup.\"\n\nAt times, the Twins allowed that lineup to attack them, in a way, especially during an erratic sixth inning while the score was still tied.\n\nFirst, reliever Steven Okert plunked .197-hitting Andrew Benintendi with a sinker, a problem made worse when Andrew Vaughn cracked a double to the center-field fence. Okert recovered to strike out pinch hitter Luis Robert Jr. but then made way for righthander Josh Staumont.\n\nEloy Jim\u00e9nez welcomed him by slicing a looper into center field, driving Benintendi home with the go-ahead run. After Paul DeJong struck out, Nicky Lopez pounded a shoe-high slider into the dirt in front of home plate. But the seemingly harmless chopper bounced so high toward right field, first baseman Jose Miranda couldn't reach it, and Vaughn scored on the odd single.\n\nThen Lopez, 3-for-8 on steals this season, took off for second base, which must have caught the Twins by surprise. Ryan Jeffers popped up and threw to second base -- where nobody was standing. Willi Castro rushed into shallow center field, corralled the ball, and threw it home in hopes of throwing out Jim\u00e9nez.\n\nBut the throw hit the pitcher's mound and bounced into the air, allowing the run to score. And when Jeffers bobbled the ball, Lopez took third base.\n\n\"RJ made a great throw. It was as good of a throw as he could make, and if someone's there, if an infielder's there to catch the ball, I think Lopez is probably out,\" Baldelli said. \"But it wasn't to be had, and we had to find other ways to win the game.\"\n\nThey did, first by responding right away with overwhelming force. Buxton doubled, Lee singled and Matt Wallner hit a 391-foot home run, his first since April 13, to tie the game.\n\n\"I feel good again. I have for the past six weeks, so just kind of building up on that and the confidence,\" said Wallner, who also blasted a double, 111.2 mph off his bat, in the third inning. \"It took me a while, but I feel like I'm finally in a good spot again.\"\n\nMoments later, Carlos Correa lifted a 3-2 fastball into the White Sox's bullpen, giving the Twins a 6-5 lead.\n\nIt didn't last. Griffin Jax walked Robert to open the eighth, and a stolen base and wild pitch put him on third base. With two outs, Lopez -- yep, him again -- reached out for a 3-2 sweeper and lifted it just over Lee's glove and the edge of the infield, allowing Robert to tie the score again.\n\n\"Maybe if I was 20 pounds lighter, I would have gotten there,\" Lee joked of the fluky play. \"I almost had a little doinker over his head, too, but he got me today.\"\n\nThe White Sox didn't score again, though, when the Twins' bullpen stiffened. Jhoan Duran pitched a scoreless 10th, Kody Funderburk earned his first career save with a 1-2-3 11th, and the Twins preserved their five-game winning streak in Chicago.", "source": {"uri":

To be able to win in this league, you've got to be able to do that.\n\n\"You've got to shut guys down late and you've got to add some runs or be able to come back at times. (The Twins) have a really good bullpen back there, they have some really good arms as they displayed today, but we've got to find ways to win.\"\n\nThe Sox squandered a solid outing by starter Chris Flexen -- two runs in six innings -- and dropped to 3-7 in extra innings.\n\nThe Sox saw a 5-2 lead turn into a 6-5 deficit when the Twins scored four in the seventh against reliever Jordan Leasure, who returned to the majors from Triple-A Charlotte on Monday.\n\nBrooks Lee drove in a run with a single. Matt Wallner hit a game-tying, two-run home run that had an exit velocity of 116.7 mph. And then Carlos Correa put the Twins ahead with a two-out towering solo home run to left.\n\n\"Leasure hadn't thrown in three days and he was ready to go,\" Grifol said. \"It was the right situation for him. Against this lineup, there's really no soft landing, but a three-run lead in the seventh inning, we were all comfortable giving him the ball and saying, 'Hey, go get three outs.' Just didn't happen.\"\n\nThe Sox tied it with a run in the eighth on a two-out RBI bloop double by Nicky Lopez.\n\n\"I'm feeling confident right now and sometimes you've got to ride that confident wave,\" said Lopez, who went 2-for-3 with two RBIs.\n\nThe game went into extra innings, where Michael Kopech had a bounce-back 1-2-3 inning a day after surrendering four in the ninth in a 7-4 loss to the Miami Marlins.\n\n\"I was really happy with the way he responded from yesterday's outing and coming out, man on second base and making really good pitches,\" Grifol said.\n\nThe Sox came up empty in their half of the 10th.\n\nGiven another opportunity, the Twins came through with two in the 11th. Lee broke the tie with an RBI single against Jared Shuster. The Twins scored another run on a slow grounder to third.\n\nThe Sox were retired in order in the bottom of the 11th to suffer their sixth loss in their last eight games. At 26-67, the Sox are a season-high 41 games under .500. They are 0-8 against the Twins this season.\n\n\"Those close ones hurt,\" Lopez said. \"You want to see it go your way and build that confidence and let us get on a roll and sometimes when you see us lose those games, those tough one-run games, it can weigh on us a little bit.\n\n\"But like I've said before, you've got to come to the ballpark ready to compete again. It is in the past, we can't take that back. What is it, 67 games that we've lost and a lot of them are probably close to being one-run (8-18 record), two-run (6-11) games. It's tough.

He threw five innings while giving up just two runs against the Twins back on May 1.\n\nMinnesota will counter with Chris Paddack, who is fresh off the injured list and has not pitched since June 21. Paddack was dominant in seven scoreless innings against the White Sox on April 22, racking up 10 strikeouts while allowing no walks, just six hits, and zero runs. He was also impressive against the similarly-offensively-challenged Rockies a few starts ago, throwing 6 / scoreless innings before struggling in consecutive starts against Oakland and ultimately being placed on the IL.\n\nAlso, Carlos Correa is back in the lineup and batting second after yet another hand/finger scare on a hit-by-pitch, and Brooks Lee is back in the seventh spot in the batting order for the second consecutive game.", "source": {"uri": "twinkietown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twinkie Town"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_beecken@twinkietown.com", "name": "Ben Beecken", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paddack", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paddack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acPRWEbvFZ8ony1AlDgwLROIPdQ=/0x568:6812x3974/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25522542/usa_today_23597024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-01", "textStart": 699, "textEnd": 704}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 810, "textEnd": 817}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-22", "textStart": 892, "textEnd": 900}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

He earned a victory on Wednesday at Cleveland, defeating the Guardians behind six innings of one-run, three-hit ball with three walks and three strikeouts.\n\nFedde struck out 11 and didn't issue a walk while allowing one run in six innings at Minnesota on April 23. He wound up with a no-decision in that contest, his only career appearance against the Twins.\n\nOber has won three of his past four starts, including a victory Thursday against the Detroit Tigers in which he gave up three runs (one earned) in six innings with eight strikeouts. He yielded seven hits and no walks.\n\nTuesday will mark Ober's second start at Guaranteed Rate Field this season. He picked up a win on May 1 after allowing four runs and six hits in six innings, striking out three and walking none.

Currently 6 games out of first place, but do hold a wild-card spot. It has been crucial for Minnesota not to let the top spot get too far out of reach, and they have been delivering. Since June 10th, they are 17-8 winning 7 of 8 series (including a 4-game sweep of the A's), making up ground in the AL Central. One of those wins coming in the best way yesterday, a walk-off homerun. Tied 2-2 in the bottom of the ninth, Christian V\u00e1zquez hit a towering fly ball to left that won the game for the twins, 3-2.\n\nWinning a division is a marathon, not a sprint, and the Twins are well trained for that after winning the AL Central by a convincing 10-games a year ago. It is so important for teams in a competitive division to keep within striking distance, as entire seasons can change in the final weeks. The Twins are in a good spot heading into the All-Star break, as they have three games against the worst team in baseball, the Chicago White Sox, and three with the second-to-last San Fransisco Giants. Minnesota can really make up some ground before getting some well-deserved rest.\n\nAt least one Twins player won't be getting much rest during the break as Carlos Correa will represent the Twins in the All-Star game this year, the third time in his career but first for Minnesota. The Twins SS is hitting .304 with a .834 OPS and 11 HR's on the year, he is the only starter the Twins have in the All-Star game. However, there were four Twins named as replacements if needed, those being Joe Ryan, Willi Castro, Ryan Jeffers & Griffin Jax.\n\nWhile Twins fans are happy for Correa, they feel some of their other stars may have been snubbed out of an All-Star selection. Jose Miranda is one of only 11 players in the majors with a .300+ batting average, .350+ on-base percentage and a .500+ slugging percentage since April 8, when he made his first start. He was not selected.\n\nSome numbers for comparison:\n\nWilli Castro also had a case for the team but was not selected, here are his numbers compared to Jarren Duran who did make the All-Star team:\n\nAnd Griffen Jax, who is listed as an alternate, is the only reliever in the league this year with a sub-2.oo ERA with 12+ K/9 and at least 35 innings.\n\nEvery year there are guys who are more deserving than others that don't make the team, it's part of MLB politics. Do guys want to add the 'All-Star' accolade to their resume? Of course! But I imagine trading the title for a week of rest and time with family is pretty fair in a player's eyes.

They Twins led early, but a mid-inning collapse sent them down by three runs. Then, the Twins re-took the lead, but the White Sox tied things up and sent it to extras before the Twins once again answered with their offense. It was a fun, roller-coaster affair.\n\nThe bats got going immediately, with Willi Castro lining the first pitch of the game for a single. He was erased when Carlos Correa banged into a double-play, but then Trevor Larnach banged a home run over the fence in right field to give the Twins a 1-0 lead.\n\nChris Paddack was back on the hill after taking a couple of weeks off for some midseason rest. He looked sharp over the first couple of innings before starting the bottom of the third by walking Nicky Lopez. In similar fashion to the Twins' offense in the first inning, the White Sox saw the bases cleared with a double-play ball before Martin Maldonado hammered a homer to tie the game.\n\nThe Twins did something similar to answer in the top of the fourth: a Larnach walk, followed by a 5-4-3 double play off the bat of Miranda -- and then back-to-back doubles from Max Kepler and Byron Buxton to regain a one-run lead for the Twins.\n\nPaddack sent down the Sox 1-2-3 in the bottom of the frame but ran into a bit of trouble in the fifth. Eloy Jimenez led off with a single before Paul DeJong struck out. A hard-hit ball from Lopez was stopped by a diving Correa, who shoveled to second base for the force out. But he ran the count full to Corey Julks, who pulled a double into right field. With a faster runner at first in Lopez that was also off with the pitch with a full count and two outs, the run scored easily to tie the game.\n\nSteven Okert came on in the sixth inning and promptly hit Andrew Benintendi with a pitch. Then, a double from Andrew Vaughn put runners on second and third. Okert struck out pinch-hitter Luis Robert Jr. before he was replaced by Josh Staumont, who has yet to give up an earned run this season.\n\nJimenez put a great swing on a ball and lined it into center field, scoring one run. DeJong struck out, but Lopez bounced a single between Jose Miranda and Castro on the right side to bump the White Sox lead to 4-2.\n\nWith runners on the corners, Lopez took off for second. Ryan Jeffers threw through, anticipating someone covering the bag. Castro wasn't covering, however, and made a great diving play to keep the ball from going into the outfield. But Vaughn took off from third base, and Castro made an ill-advised throw home, bouncing it off the top of the mound and the tip of Jeffers' glove, allowing Lopez to get all the way to third base. Thankfully, the final error didn't come back to haunt the Twins as Julks bounced out to Jeffers in front of the plate.\n\nBut the Twins answered right back. Buxton smoked a line drive up the middle, off the glove of a diving Lopez. The ball bounced into left-center and Buxton hustled to second base for a double. Brooks Lee came through by dumping a single into right-center to pull the Twins to within 5-3. After a Jeffers ground out, Matt Wallner absolutely crushed a 98 mile-per-hour fastball to right, tying the game with a 116.7 mile-per-hour home run.\n\nAfter a Castro ground out, Carlos Correa found himself down in the 0-2. He took two fastballs inside, perilously close to hitting his hands once again, just a day after he suffered a finger contusion. But he hung in, running the count full before yanking a breaking pitch into the bullpen in right field for a go-ahead home run.\n\nThe Twins put runners on first and second with nobody out in the top of the eighth, but Buxton threw out and Lee bounced into a double play.\n\nThe Twins were still up 6-5 heading into the bottom of the eighth. Griffin Jax walked the leadoff batter, Robert Jr., who stole second with one out, advanced to third on a wild pitch with two outs, and scored on a bloop double to left field by ... you guessed it, Nicky Lopez.\n\nThe Twins threatened briefly again in the ninth after a leadoff single from Ryan Jeffers, but Wallner popped out, Castro struck out, and Correa lined out to the warning track in right field.\n\nCaleb Theilbar pitched a 1-2-3 bottom of the ninth, looking as sharp as he has in quite some time. But the Twins failed to scratch a run across in the tenth. Trevor Larnach advanced the automatic runner to third by bouncing the first pitch he saw to first base, but Miranda struck out and Kepler flew out.\n\nRocco Baldelli brought out Jhoan Duran to hold the White Sox at bay in the home half of the 10th, and he did exactly that. He struck out Vaughn and shattered Robert's bat on a slow bouncer to Correa, who rifled him out at first. After an intentional walk to Jimenez, DeJong popped out to Miranda, who made a great running catch in foul territory behind first base.\n\nThe top of the 11th started much better for the Twins, with Buxton pulling the ball in the hole between shortstop and third base to put runners on the corners with nobody out. Lee lined another RBI single to the outfield, putting the Twins on top and sending Buxton from first to third. Manuel Margot, who entered in the ninth as a pinch-runner for Jeffers, bounced a slow roller up the third baseline that plated Buxton, putting the Twins on top by a score of 8-6.\n\nBaldelli turned to Kody Funderburk for the bottom of the 11th to close the game, and after getting to a three-ball count against the leadoff batter, Danny Mendick, he came back to coax a pop out to Miranda. A pair of groundouts later and Funderburk had his first career big-league save.", "source": {"uri": "twinkietown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twinkie Town"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But in actuality, the Twins are already past the halfway point of the campaign, having compiled a 52-39 record through the first 91 games of the season.\n\nAs it stands now, the Twins are firmly in an American League wild-card spot and they're just 5.5 games back of the Cleveland Guardians in the AL Central standings. They're in a position to contend for a division title and appear playoff bound at the midway mark of the season -- about all you can ask for, especially considering many of the injuries they've faced to this point.\n\nBut if we were taking it back to school and bringing out the report cards, what grade would the Twins receive for their first-half start. ESPN's David Schoenfield issued grades to all 30 Major League Baseball teams, giving the Twins a \"B\" for their efforts in the first half of the season.\n\nWhy the Twins weren't given a better grade is due to their record against the American League's best. While Minnesota is 52-39 overall, the team is 0-14 against the New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles and the division-leading Guardians, something Schoenfield noted.\n\n\"They'll have to beat Cleveland in head-to-head action, but I think the AL Central will turn into a fight down the stretch,\" Schoenfield wrote.\n\nThe Guardians, who the Twins will be fighting for the division title, were given an \"A\" grade for their first-half start that featured excellent showings from the offense and bullpen.\n\nHowever, Schoenfield pointed out to key issues with the Twins that, in theory, shouldn't persist the rest of the season and actually make the first-half record even more impressive. First are the injuries to Royce Lewis that have limited him to just 24 games this season.\n\nAdditionally, Schoenfield acknowledged the struggles top starter Pablo Lopez has endured this season -- there's been a spike in home runs allowed from Lopez and he has a 5.18 ERA.\n\nDespite that, the Twins have continued to press on and win games. They tout extensive offensive depth in the lineup that's proved to be critical as they've battled through injuries.\n\nNow the Twins will just have to prove they can compete with the American League's best in the second half -- or next semester -- as they look to overtake the Guardians in the AL Central.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_twins/01j2erbx6gvah6cgjmmy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The teams' games, while frequently dramatic and adversarial, somehow still have the inevitability of game-speed back-field practice.\n\nThe Twins will do it till they get it right, in other words.\n\nCase in point, Monday's matchup, in which the Twins endured one of the more erratic innings of their season to fall behind late, only to roll their eyes and rally with sheer power, then give the lead away, only to retake it. The result was an 8-6, 11-inning victory at Guaranteed Rate Field, the Twins' eighth in eight meetings this year and one that gives them exactly twice as many wins, 52, as the last-place White Sox, 26.\n\nByron Buxton and Brooks Lee each singled in the 11th inning, the latter scoring courtesy runner Max Kepler with the tie-breaking run. Buxton scored on Manuel Margot's ground out, giving the Twins the cushion they needed to finally subdue the feisty Sox.\n\nNot that avert-your-eyes baseball is limited to the bottom of the standings. The Twins, who piled up 15 hits, eight of them for extra bases, seemed to squander Chris Paddack's five solid innings in his return to the Twins' rotation, and fall three runs down with a sixth inning in which several things went wrong.\n\nFirst, reliever Steven Okert plunked .197-hitting Andrew Benintendi with a sinker, a problem made worse when Andrew Vaughn cracked a double to the center field fence. Okert recovered to strike out pinch-hitter Luis Robert Jr., but then made way for righthander Josh Staumont.\n\nEloy Jim\u00e9nez welcomed him by slicing a looper into center field, driving Benintendi home with the go-ahead run. After Paul DeJong struck out, Nicky Lopez pounded a shoe-high slider into the dirt in front of home plate. But the seemingly harmless chopper bounced so high toward right field, first baseman Jos\u00e9 Miranda couldn't reach it, and Vaughn scored on the odd single.\n\nThen Lopez, 3-for-8 on steals this season, took off for second base, which must have caught the Twins by surprise. Ryan Jeffers popped up and threw to second base -- where nobody was standing. Willi Castro rushed into shallow center field, corralled the ball, and threw it home in hopes of throwing out Jim\u00e9nez.\n\nBut the throw hit the pitcher's mound and bounced into the air, allowing the run to score. And when Jeffers bobbled the ball, Lopez took third base.\n\nStaumont retired Corey Julks to hold the line at a three-run deficit, and the Twins responded right away with overwhelming force. Byron Buxton doubled, Brooks Lee singled and Matt Wallner hit a 391-foot home run, his first since April 13, to tie the game. Moments later, Carlos Correa lifted a 3-2 fastball into the White Sox's bullpen, giving the Twins a 6-5 lead.\n\nIt didn't last. Griffin Jax walked Robert to open the eighth, and a stolen base and wild pitch put him on third base. With two outs, Lopez -- yep, him again -- reached out for a 3-2 sweeper and lifted it just over Lee's glove and the edge of the infield, allowing Robert to tie the game again.\n\nThe bullpen, though, stiffened over the final three innings, preserving the Twins' five-game winning streak in Chicago.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors":

{"uri": "2024-07-415709560", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-09", "time": "04:02:26", "dateTime": "2024-07-09T04:02:26Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-09T03:37:10Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "url": "https://clutchpoints.com/what-perfect-twins-trade-deadline-looks-like", "title": "What a perfect Twins trade deadline looks like", "body": "The Twins need to add power and pitching at the deadline in order to be legit contenders in 2024.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins are a deceptively talented team. While they're not anybody's first thought as a contender this year, the Twins have a realistic path to the postseason. A strong second half push could lead to Minnesota's fifth playoff appearance in eight years. And adding at the MLB trade deadline gives the team a legit shot at contending.\n\nWith a record of 51-39 the Twins are six games behind the Cleveland Guardians in the AL Central. It's not an insurmountable lead. And if the season ended abruptly, Minnesota would have one of the American League's Wild Card spots locked up.\n\nFor the doubters out there, the Twins have a nearly 86 percent chance of making the playoffs this year, with a 52.9 percent chance to clinch a Wild Card berth and a 32.8 percent chance of winning the division, via FanGraphs. Minnesota gets an 84.5 percent chance of making the postseason and even a 6.8 percent chance of winning the World Series from Baseball Reference. That's the seventh most likely outcome according to the site, just behind the New York Yankees.\n\nSo, they're saying there's a chance. Actually, there are pretty good odds that the Twins will be playing meaningful games this fall. The question is, what does Minnesota need to add at the deadline to make a push into the postseason?\n\nThe Twins have a ton of infield talent, led by shortstop Carlos Correa. The 29-year-old was just named to his third All-Star game and is having a terrific season for Minnesota. Correa has 16 doubles and 11 home runs to go along with 48 runs scored and 45 RBI in 71 games. He's batting over .300 with an OPS of .883 and an OPS+ of 148. So far in 2024, Correa has put up 3.1 WAR.\n\nAnd to complement the veteran shortstop, the Twins are stocked with promising young talent at the corners. Jose Miranda in particular is having a standout season.\n\nThe 26-year-old infielder has been excellent for the Twins in 2024. Miranda is slashing .331/.373/.533 with a .906 OPS and a stellar OPS+ of 153. In 73 games he's produced 20 doubles and nine home runs with 43 RBI. He's accumulated 2.5 WAR so far this season, dwarfing his 0.6 WAR from 2022 and 2023 combined. And he's been on a heater at the plate recently. Over his last five games Miranda is 13 for 16 with four doubles, a homer, seven runs scored and 6 RBI. That hot streak included an insane 12 consecutive hits.\n\nDuring this stretch, Miranda has played first, third and started as the Twins' designated hitter. The team's preferred starter at third base, Royce Lewis, hit the injured list with a groin injury in early July. The former first overall selection from the 2017 draft has looked very good when healthy. However, this is the 25-year-old's second trip to the injured list this season and he's already missed more than two months of play.\n\nTwins need to buy at the deadline to become legit contenders\n\nIn Lewis' stead the Twins called up their eighth overall pick from the 2022 draft, Brooks Lee, to field the hot corner's vacancy. And since arriving in the majors, Lee has raked. In five games since his call up, he's gone 9-for-19 with a double, a home run, three runs scored and six RBI. Lee has posted an OPS+ of 225, albeit in a small sample size. During that time, he's appeared primarily at third base but has also played shortstop and worked as the Twins' designated hitter.\n\nMinnesota brought signed veteran first baseman Carlos Santana in the offseason to a one-year deal for $5.25 million and the 38-year-old is actually second on the team with 12 home runs. That's nothing to write home about, but it's fairly good production for the price.\n\nStill, the Twins could certainly use a power bat in their lineup. They haven't gotten great production from the corner outfield spots or from the designated hitter. While the infield is pretty stacked, Minnesota would benefit from a versatile hitter who could play first and DH for the team while driving in runs or an outfielder who could increase that group's production.\n\nTampa Bay Rays' left fielder Randy Arozarena is a possible trade deadline asset. The 29-year-old is making $8.1 million this year, which would be in line with the cost-conscious Twins. He's also under club control until 2027, which might help Minnesota pull the trigger and give up some prospects to land him. Arozarena started slow but has begun to warm up of late.\n\nThe New York Mets' Pete Alonso fits the first base/DH role the Twins would benefit by upgrading. The slugger hit 46 home runs for the Mets last season and is up to 18 in 88 games so far this year. However, he's making $20.5 million in 2024 and becomes a free agent after this season, making him an expensive second-half rental, which the Twins tend to avoid.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks' Christian Walker also fits the bill as a first base/DH power bat. The 33-year-old Gold Glove winner has 22 home runs and 64 RBI in 90 games this season. Like Alonso, Walker would be a second-half rental. However, he'd be a bit more palatable at $10.9 million this season.\n\nOf course, it's unknown if the Diamondbacks will move Walker at the deadline as the team is still in the National League Wild Card race. And furthermore, it's uncertain that the Twins would be willing to invest money and prospects for a couple months of Walker. Nonetheless, he is exactly the type of bat that could transform this offense.\n\nThe Washington Nationals' Jesse Winker wouldn't receive as much fanfare but he could be available come July 30 and would be more inline with what the front office might be willing to pay for a second-half only player. Winker, 30, is making $2 million this season and hits free agency in 2025.\n\nMinnesota could also really use an extra starter. The Twins' pitching hasn't been terrible this season as the group is top 10 in WAR. But for a serious postseason run it will likely be necessary to add an arm to the rotation.\n\nHowever, the same issues exist for top pitching talent as elite hitting talent. Available players are either going to be on expiring deals, making them expensive second-half rentals like the Detroit Tigers' Jack Flaherty. Or they're going to require a large group of prospects to land, like the Chicago White Sox's Garrett Crochet, who's only 25-years-old, is making just $800K this year and doesn't hit free agency until 2027. It's difficult to see the Twins shelling out big money for a rental but it's also hard to believe they'll get into a bidding war for Crochet with other MLB teams.\n\nLast season, Minnesota decided not to make any moves at the trade deadline and the team made it all the way to the ALDS. It's certainly possible that the Twins goes a similar route this year, hoping that injured players make successful returns and the talent in place is enough to carry the team.\n\nManagement in Minnesota may not want to pay the bill but the Twins have a good chance of making the postseason this year. Once again the organization is faced with question of what to do at the deadline. The Twins as currently constructed will more than likely fall short of a championship. Adding a starter to the rotation and a power bat would go a long way to making them legitimate contenders.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gianakos@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Michael Gianakos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanGraphs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FanGraphs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervin_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ervin Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Winker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Winker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/What-a-perfect-Twins-trade-deadline-looks-like.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 5547, "textEnd": 5554}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

His eight RBIs are second to none.\n\nLee's RBI single, an RBI groundout by Manny Margot and a 1-2-3 inning from Kody Funderburk in extras helped the Minnesota Twins move within five games of Cleveland, as they topped the Chicago White Sox 8-6 in 11 innings on Monday at Guaranteed Rate Field.\n\nMatt Wallner belted a two-run, game-tying homer in the seventh inning and doubled. Carlos Correa and Trevor Larnach each homered for the Twins, who earned their 24th come-from-behind victory of the season and improved to 52-39.\n\nLarnach's first-inning homer extended a streak of consecutive games with a round-tripper to 26 for the Twins, who finished with 15 hits. The Twins have belted 42 homers during the streak.\n\n\"Our players aren't really letting us feel like (we're out of it) because they're competing really well,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"Most innings, we go out there, we're very competitive in our at-bats. It took some really large-scale plays and moments to get back in the game. It took a lot.\"\n\nThe Twins haven't been this close to the lead in the American League Central since May 18, when they trailed the Guardians by 4 1/2 games.\n\nLee is playing his part, as the Twins have won four of his six games played since debuting last Wednesday. He finished 2-for-5 Monday and is hitting .458/.462/.625 in 26 plate appearances.\n\n\"I mean, I would hope I would play well,\" Lee said. \"I never think I'm not going to play good. But yeah, it's just been such a special week for me. My family, too. I mean it still feels like a blur.\"\n\nHours after calling her own mother, Marney Gellner implored Larnach to do the same after his homer: \"Better call your Mama right now, sir.\" The play-by-play announcer for the Minnesota Lynx, Gellner made club history Monday night in becoming the first woman to broadcast a Twins game.\n\nA longtime former Twins sideline reporter, Gellner -- who in 2018 called a Minnesota Timberwolves game, becoming only the second woman to do so in NBA history -- also called several spring training games in 2019 and uttered the phrase \"Better call Mama\" any time a Twins player homered.\n\nShe was asked a month ago to fill in for Cory Provus, who is on vacation during the Chicago series.\n\n\"I'm super proud of it,\" Gellner said. \"And, I'm just ready to just go ahead and get on with the game. ... I appreciate this. I think it's a wonderful opportunity. I'm super, super grateful. Thrilled. I don't know all the adjectives I can use. But I'm also like, let's get on with it. I'll accept the honor and feel, 'Yeah, it is a big deal.' It is a big deal to me personally and I'm ready to move on.\"\n\nOver on the radio side, Triple-A St. Paul broadcaster Sean Aronson is filling in for Kris Atteberry for the entire road trip. Aronson has been the Saints broadcaster for the past 18 seasons.\n\nChris Paddack's fastball averaged 93.8 mph, a slight increase as he returned following 15 days on the injured list with right shoulder fatigue. Paddack allowed two earned runs and three hits in five innings. \"Big picture I liked what I saw,\" Baldelli said. ... Funderburk's save was the first of his career. ... Baldelli praised Caleb Thielbar for his perfect ninth inning, his sixth straight scoreless outing. ... Baldelli suggested Byron Buxton, who went 3-for-5 with two runs scored, Lee and Ryan Jeffers all may be given Tuesday's game off. Jeffers' foot appeared to be bothering him as he limped off the field in the seventh inning. Lee has played in seven straight games, including a July 2 contest at St. Paul. ... Brock Stewart will pitch for St. Paul at Triple-A Louisville on Wednesday as he begins a rehab assignment. Stewart (right shoulder tendinitis) hasn't appeared in a game since May 1. ... Wallner's seventh-inning homer exited his bat at 116.7 mph. \"I feel good again,\" Wallner said. \"I have for the past six weeks, so just kind of building up on that and the confidence.

Last night's game between the White Sox and Twins was rained out, meaning the 2 will play a pair to decide the series after Minnesota took Game 1 on Monday, 8-6.\n\nThe Twins have a winning record on the road while the White Sox are under .333 at home. The Twins have also won 7 of their last 9 while Chicago has lost 6 of their last 8.\n\nKeep scrolling for the top odds, probable pitchers and a prediction for the first in Wednesday's doubleheader.\n\nMinnesota is far and away the better batting team in this matchup and has the edge in the bullpen as well, but these starting pitchers are about even which at first made me hesitant to take Minnesota -1.5 at +105.\n\nBut at the end of the day, this one doesn't take much explanation. The White Sox have been flat out terrible this season except for some solid pitching from today's starter Erick Fedde and Garrett Crochet. The White Sox don't have a batter with more than 50 at-bats hitting over .250 this season while Minnesota has 7 such batters.\n\nFedde may keep things close for a bit, but I doubt this will be interesting late.\n\nOdds above via Fanatics Sportsbook. Check out our Fanatics Promo Code for a look at one of the best welcome offers in the business.\n\nAs you can see, Minnesota is considered fairly heavy road favorites for Wednesday's game, but in my opinion the odds are still lower than I'd have guessed coming in.\n\nThe Twins sit at -160 ML with Chicago +130 to win outright. Chicago is favored to keep the game within a run at +1.5 while Minnesota holds +105 odds to win by 2 or more runs.\n\nThe Over/Under for Wednesday's first game is set at 8, a fair number considering the caliber of pitchers set to hit the mound. The over is just slightly favored.\n\nWhite Sox pitcher Erick Fedde, despite Chicago's struggles, is putting together by far the best season of his career in Major League Baseball.\n\nFedde, who used to play for the Nationals, has his best K/BB ratio of his career, is on track to shoot well past his most innings pitched in a single year and is well on track to surpass his season high for strikeouts in a year.\n\nFedde has yet to face the Twins this season, but he's had some trouble in the past against this lineup. The Twins are hitting .304 against Fedde with 10 hits in 33 at-bats. Carlos Santana has accounted for nearly half those at-bats and 3 of those 10 hits.\n\nBailey Ober will take the mound opposite Fedde, and he's fared really well against the White Sox. Chicago's lineup is hitting just .253 against Ober with strong success against Andrew Vaughn, the White Sox' top hitter.\n\nIt seems Ober has only gotten better as the season has progressed, too. He's earned a win in 4 of his last 5 starts and has struck out at least 8 in 4 of his last 5. If you're wondering, his line for Ks today sits at 6.5 (O +1.5 Fanatics)", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stone@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Ethan Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Fedde", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erick Fedde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Ober", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Ober"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_23705526.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Buxton led off the frame with a double -- he went 3 for 5 with an RBI and two runs scored -- and Lee brought him home with a single the next at-bat to get the Twins within a run. Ryan Jeffers then advanced Lee to third on a groundout.\n\nThat set the stage for Matt Wallner, who hit a two-run, game-tying homer off White Sox reliever Justin Anderson 389 feet into right field. Wallner's homer came off his bat at 116.7 mph, the hardest hit ball by a Twins player this season and the second-hardest hit homer in franchise history.\n\nCarlos Correa, who exited Sunday's game against the Houston Astros after being hit on the hand by a pitch, then proved his hand wasn't an issue and hit a 357-foot solo shot to plate the go-ahead run.\n\nNicky Lopez knotted the game in the eighth inning for Chicago with a two-out RBI double off Twins reliever Griffin Jax that scored Luis Robert Jr., who drew a leadoff walk. Lopez also had a two-out RBI single during the sixth inning in a three-run frame for the White Sox in which they took a 5-2 lead.\n\nCaleb Thielbar pitched a scoreless ninth inning, fanning one, to preserve a 6-6 tie and send it into extra innings.

Eloy Jimenez got them started with an RBI single, then Lopez hit the two-out RBI single a couple at-bats later and Jimenez was later able to score following a throwing error from Willi Castro.\n\nTrevor Larnach got the Twins started in the first inning with a 382-foot solo homer, but the White Sox got that back in the third inning when Martin Maldonado hit a 408-foot solo shot.\n\nThe Twins took a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning when Buxton hit an RBI double to left field that scored Kepler, who doubled the previous at-bat, the 200th double of his career.\n\nThe White Sox knotted the game when Corey Julks hit an RBI double during the fifth inning.\n\nChris Paddack was back on the mound after being reinstated from the injured list Monday and threw a solid outing, allowing just two runs off three hits while fanning three across five innings. White Sox starter Chris Flexen allowed just two runs off seven hits while fanning four across six innings.\n\nThe Twins and White Sox meet for the second of their three-game series at 7:10 p.m. on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Buxton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Byron Buxton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Jax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Griffin Jax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicky Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Thielbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Thielbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Larnach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Larnach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paddack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paddack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Flexen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Flexen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_Maldonado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn Maldonado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloy_Jim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eloy Jim\u00e9nez"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/inside_the_twins/01j2anr4w5t4eadgtxvq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

That's not inside information as much as it is logic because the Twins' offense is rolling while the pitching has left something to be desired.\n\nOn one hand, the Twins could view the return of Royce Lewis and Brock Stewart from the injured list as key additions for the stretch run in August and September.\n\nStewart was lights-out as a right-handed flamethrower in the bullpen before he went on the injured list earlier this season. He started a rehab assignment at Triple-A St. Paul this week and the expectation is that he'll join the Twins after next week's All-Star break, if not sooner.\n\nThe Twins have a strong bullpen highlighted by Stewart, Griffin Jax, Jorge Alcala, Caleb Thielbar and Jhoan Duran, but adding talent for the stretch run and postseason is always a good idea.\n\nLewis, one of the game's best hitters when healthy, is recovering from a strained groin. When he returns, the Twins could boast an infield of Lewis at third, Carlos Correa at shortstop, Brooks Lee at second base, Jose Miranda at first base and Ryan Jeffers at catch. With Byron Buxton, Willi Castro, Max Kepler, Matt Wallner and Manuel Margot occupying the outfield, the Twins don't need to add anything to a lineup that has scored the most runs in baseball since April 22.\n\nThat leads to the situation with starting pitchers. Joe Ryan and Simeon Woods Richardson have been Minnesota's most reliable starters, while Pablo Lopez and Bailey Ober have been up and down. Chris Paddack just returned from an IL stint but he hasn't been good enough to trust in a playoff game.\n\nThe Twins could hope for more consistency from Lopez -- like his 23 strikeouts and one run allowed in consecutive starts against the A's and Mariners in late June -- but putting all of their eggs in his basket could be risky. Adding a reliable starter could be just what the Twins need. So who's available?\n\nAccording to reports, the Blue Jays, Nationals, Rays and Rangers are possible sellers.\n\nToronto has impending free-agent lefty Yusei Kikuchi, the Nationals have impending free-agent lefty Patrick Corbin and the Rangers have righty Nathan Eovaldi, who has a $22 million option but could opt for free agency after the season. The Rays have right-hander Zach Eflin, who owns the lowest walk rate in the majors at 0.8 per nine innings and is signed for $18 million next season.\n\nKen Rosenthal mentioned the Tigers could trade right-hander Jack Flaherty and that they would be looking for something in return that is at least equal to a first-round compensation pick that they could receive if they hold onto him and he leaves as a free agent.\n\nWould the Tigers entertain a trade to a division foe? The same question goes for the White Sox, who could be dealing left-handed All-Star Garrett Crochet, whose 12.5 strikeouts per nine innings leads the majors. Crochet is only making $800,000 this season and is under team control for two more seasons, so the asking price is going to be very high.\n\nEovaldi, an All-Star in 2021 and 2023, may make the most sense from a cost/benefit perspective. The Twins are loaded with talented prospects and they have the ammo to get a deal done. It might be a rental and the Twins might not be able to re-sign the 34-year-old, but for a team that has the talent to make a deep playoff run, adding someone of Eovaldi's caliber and postseason experience would be an incredible boost.\n\nCrochet, Flaherty and Kikuchi arguably rank 2-3-4, followed by Eflin and Corbin.\n\nMinnesota has six players in Baseball America's latest top-100 prospects. They're probably not going to be interested in trading elite prospects like Walker Jenkins and Emmanuel Rodriguez, but would they consider offering a package featuring Luke Keaschall, Zebby Matthews, David Festa or Gabriel Gonzalez? What about offering Wallner or Eddy Julien?\n\nThe Twins have a stockpile of talent to offer in trades, it's just a matter of whether the team will pull the trigger on a deal to give the 2024 Twins a better shot to win the World Series title.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Yet, the 28-year-old somehow made headlines during the Minnesota Twins' visit to Windy City yesterday.\n\nCameras caught Ryan speaking to teammate Carlos Correa in the top half of the seventh inning following the shortstop's home run. While the broadcast was on the Minnesota dugout, Ryan was seen pouring a strange substance down his pants:\n\nWe're not 100 percent sure what that was, but it appears to be baby powder. Either way, the clip has gone viral and made the Minnesota Twins' star the subject of jokes across social media:\n\nAlso Read: Power Ranking All 30 MLB Teams After Week 14 Games\n\nRyan has pieced together the best season of his young MLB career thus far. He is 6-5 with a 3.29 ERA (currently his best mark) with 118 strikeouts against only 16 walks in 109.1 innings pitched.\n\nMinnesota is five games behind the Cleveland Guardians for first in the AL Central, a division the Twins won a year ago. They're 2.5 behind the slumping New York Yankees for the top AL Wild Card spot, and 3.5 clear of the Kansas City Royals, who are on the outside looking in.\n\nThe Twins got off to a horrendous 6-12 start, but a 12-game winning streak vaulted them right back into the playoff picture. Minnesota has been one of the hottest teams since mid-April, entering play tonight with a 52-39 record.\n\nBut the team is clicking on all cylinders now, and they already look like a team nobody will want to face in October. The Twins ended their unbelievable 18-game postseason losing streak last year by sweeping the Toronto Blue Jays in the Wild Card Series, so that's one mental hurdle cleared as they try to win their first championship in 33 years.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Card_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild Card Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Bluffing_and_Betting", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Bluffing and Betting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Joe-Ryan-Pants.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

In this case, Lee is a big leaguer already, but the larger point remains. Even elite-level prospects have a wide spectrum of career outcomes.\n\nLimiting this to former Twins, the comp for Lee that immediately comes to mind is Jorge Polanco, another switch-hitting middle infielder who came up as a shortstop before shifting mostly to second base. Polanco was an All-Star starter in 2019 and also played at an All-Star level in 2021, and he ranks 17th among Twins position players in career wins above replacement.\n\nInjuries were a problem for Polanco late in his Twins career, but during his six-year peak from 2018 to 2023 he hit .270/.338/.455 for a 116 OPS+, with an average of 23 homers, 36 doubles/triples and 59 walks per 150 games. Lee is capable of batting quite a bit higher than .270, but he's also no sure thing to develop as much power as Polanco, who topped out at 33 homers in 2021.\n\nStylistic-based quibbles and health-related variance aside, I think Polanco is a reasonable comp for Lee if the goal is the 50th percentile outcome rather than the best- or worst-case scenarios. Switch-hitting infielder with a 110-120 OPS+ bat who's an above-average regular most seasons and an All-Star in his best seasons. I'll bet the Twins would sign up for that again.\n\nOf course, a week into his big-league career, Lee is hitting .450 and looking more like the second coming of Rod Carew.\n\nWhy did the Twins release Jordan Balazovic? -- Jason C.\n\nTwo years ago, Jordan Balazovic was a consensus top-100 prospect coming off an excellent Double-A season. Now he's headed to South Korea, with the Twins agreeing to release the 25-year-old right-hander from their Triple-A roster last week so he can sign with the Doosan Bears of the KBO. They likely got a small amount of money in return.\n\nBalazovic once looked like a potential front-line starter, but his secondary pitches and command never progressed as hoped. His overall development was also repeatedly sidetracked by knee and shoulder injuries, as well as a broken jaw from an off-field incident two spring trainings ago. (There's that wide spectrum of career outcomes for top prospects that I mentioned earlier.)\n\nMoved to the bullpen last season in an effort to salvage his Twins career, Balazovic posted a 5.44 ERA with 134 base runners allowed in 81 innings as a Triple-A reliever. He received an unexpected call-up in the middle of last season when the Twins were desperate for fresh arms, but finished with a 4.44 ERA and 38 base runners allowed in 24 1/3 innings.\n\nAnd that's the totality of his big-league career with the Twins, who selected a 17-year-old Balazovic in the fifth round out of Canada as part of the Terry Ryan-led front office regime's last draft class in 2016. Fortunately for the Twins, they also picked major leaguers Alex Kirilloff, Jose Miranda and Griffin Jax, plus Ben Rortvedt and Akil Baddoo, ahead of Balazovic in that same class.\n\nIf Simeon Woods Richardson stays healthy and pitches effectively, any talk of an innings limit in the second half? -- John R.\n\nI don't think it'll be a big factor. Simeon Woods Richardson totaled 118 1/3 innings in 2023 and 112 1/3 innings in 2022, so increasing the 23-year-old's workload to 150 innings this year would be reasonable. He's on pace for 155 innings between the majors and Triple A. I'd guess that his second-half workload will be based way more on effectiveness than innings.\n\nAny talk of moving Louie Varland back to the bullpen? -- Aaron H.\n\nNothing has really changed on that front.\n\nLouie Varland may wind up in the bullpen again, like last year, but it's not going to happen unless/until the Twins feel confident they have the starter depth necessary to get through an entire season. That's impossible to know in early July, especially with Chris Paddack fresh off the injured list after a much-needed break and Woods Richardson still needing to prove himself.\n\nHow likely is it that the Twins will trade for a starting pitcher? -- Steven S.\n\nAs part of my early trade deadline primer a few weeks ago, I suggested a front-line starter was the Twins' biggest need. Paddack being shut down with shoulder fatigue and David Festa struggling in two fill-in starts are the only notable changes since, so it remains true. But the \"front-line\" part of front-line starter is key, because they're not lacking in decent options.\n\nUpgrading the playoff rotation would require adding someone better than Bailey Ober, the current No. 3 starter after Pablo L\u00f3pez and Joe Ryan. And even upgrading the regular-season rotation would require adding someone better than Paddack or Woods Richardson, as well as in-house backup arms like Festa, Varland and ascending Double-A prospect Zebby Matthews.\n\nThat's a much higher bar than simply needing a competent starter, and the cost to clear it would be substantial in terms of prospect capital, especially if Twins ownership isn't willing to take on much salary.\n\nGiven next year's likely constrained payroll, do you expect the front office to deviate from their past trade deadline strategy of targeting players with one-plus years of team control as opposed to pure rentals? -- Paul J.\n\nYes. I suspect any trade that would add significant guaranteed 2025 salary is unlikely for the Twins after they cut payroll by $30 million this offseason and are below revenue projections due to lower-than-expected attendance.\n\nI wrote about this topic two weeks ago, calling it \"unfortunate and frankly sort of pathetic.\" I'd love to be proven wrong, but the Twins deserve every ounce of skepticism based on how ownership handled this offseason.\n\nHow much do you attribute the lower-than-anticipated attendance numbers to many fans not being able to watch the Twins on television? -- Mason R.\n\nThere's room to quibble about how much each specific factor has led to the Twins' decreased attendance, but it's undeniable that their television mess, on the heels of their inactive, payroll-slashing offseason, brought rising fan morale to a screeching halt and turned off many devoted followers in a way that reinforced their longstanding suspicions about ownership.\n\nLast season, the Twins won a division title and their first playoff series in two decades, and this season they've followed it up by playing at a 93-win pace. To do that and then not have your attendance increase is rare, but to see it actually decrease by 1,200 per game year over year requires a unique set of circumstances almost designed to push away customers.\n\nThere's no logical on-field reason for a decline in attendance; in fact the opposite should be true, which lays bare the real reason. And unfortunately for fans, lower attendance and lower TV viewership leads to lower revenue, which in turn likely leads to lower payroll. It's a vicious cycle and can become a self-fulfilling prophecy if a team doesn't actively fight against it.\n\nAre the Twins OK with eating Randy Dobnak's contract or why is he never a call-up option? -- Joe V.\n\nRandy Dobnak is owed the same amount of money regardless of where he's pitching. His lack of major-league action since 2021 has been due to a finger injury that required multiple surgeries, and his subsequent struggles to get back on track at Triple A. He has a 4.65 ERA across 209 innings for the Saints the past two seasons, often struggling with control.\n\nDobnak has put together a good stretch recently, but he was never going to be ahead of prospects such as Varland, Woods Richardson and Festa on the Twins' rotation depth chart, and fellow Triple-A veteran Caleb Boushley has been similarly effective for the Saints this season as well.\n\nBarring a rash of second-half starter injuries, Dobnak's best chance to get back to the majors will probably be as a long reliever.\n\nCarlos Correa doesn't have a stolen base since 2019. With players like Jose Miranda and Christian V\u00e1zquez running for the Twins, will Correa steal one this season? -- Isaac K.\n\nI doubt it. Carlos Correa was once an effective runner, stealing 27 bases at an 80 percent success rate in his first two seasons with the Houston Astros, but soon after that he made a conscious decision to stop running in an effort to avoid injuries. The last time he even attempted to steal was September 2022, which resulted in a caught stealing and an injury scare.\n\nLike many players after a decade in the big leagues, Correa has also gotten much slower, ranking below average in sprint speed since 2022. I'd assume he could swipe a handful of bases per season while rarely being caught, but whatever minimal value that adds would be wiped away and then some the moment Correa got banged up on a slide and had to miss games.\n\nWhy don't the Twins have their batters bunt to get an easy hit when there's a shift? -- John N.\n\nI double-checked to make sure this question didn't get stuck in the mailbag system for the past two years, but it's indeed a new submission.\n\nSince last season, when MLB changed the rules to significantly limit shifts, the Twins have 14 bunt hits and the average AL team has 16 bunt hits. They have bunted for hits at essentially a league-average rate.\n\nOne thing I've learned over the years: When you find yourself asking why one team doesn't do an \"easy\" thing that would benefit them, it's worth considering if they're different than the other teams in that regard and if it's truly an easy thing at all.\n\nJhoan Duran isn't getting as much swing-and-miss on his curveball. Have the characteristics of the curveball changed or is his lesser fastball velocity making his other pitches easier to hit? -- Chris W.\n\nBoth. Jhoan Duran has lost velocity on all three of his pitches this season, including his curveball being down an average of 1.4 mph. Velocity doesn't just matter for fastballs, and as I wrote last month, each of the four homers Duran has allowed this season have been hit on off-speed pitches thrown below his peak velocity.\n\nBeyond that, while Duran's curveball is a great pitch on its own, pairing it with a 101-104 mph fastball the past two seasons helped it be even greater. When his fastball is down to 99-102 mph, opposing hitters have more time to react, in general, and the difference between his fastball and curveball doesn't scramble their brains quite as much.\n\nI miss hearing you on KFAN. Any chance that happens again? -- James L.\n\nPossibly. I chose to take a step back from KFAN appearances this season because of feeling overextended, in part as a result of some health issues that made going to the radio studio multiple times per week a little more taxing. I've had more MRIs than Royce Lewis this year, so I'm still trying to limit my pitch counts. Everyone at KFAN has been very understanding.\n\nIf you want to hear me talking Twins, the good news is I co-host a podcast called \"Gleeman and The Geek\" that releases an average of three episodes per week. We do a \"free\" show most Fridays, and typically do Monday and Wednesday episodes exclusively for our Patreon subscribers.

He looks a lot more like he did last year,\" when Funderburk didn't allow a run during his 11-game late-season big league debut, totaling 12 innings with 19 strikeouts.\n\nThe interesting choice Monday was to turn to Funderburk with a two-run lead, rather than allow Jhoan Duran, who needed only 13 pitches to keep the score tied in the 10th inning, to remain in the game.\n\nThat might have happened, Baldelli said, if Duran had not pitched to five batters -- and needing 22 pitches -- in Sunday afternoon's victory over Houston at Target Field.\n\n\"It's not something we're opposed to doing with [Duran], going back-to-back,\" Baldelli said. \"We've talked about it and done it before. But [Monday], one inning was all we were likely to let him go.\"\n\nWhich is fine by Funderburk, who now has another souvenir to go with his first strikeout ball in his trophy case at home.\n\n\"It's always cool when it's your first time,\" Funderburk said.\n\nDespite a rain-filled forecast, the Twins were told that Tuesday night's game with the White Sox might still go on as scheduled, so the team bused to Guaranteed Rate Field and began its pregame work as usual.\n\nBut by 5 p.m., reality -- and a steady rain -- arrived. The game was postponed until Wednesday, when it will be made up 30 minutes after the scheduled 1:10 p.m. game ends.\n\nBailey Ober, Tuesday's scheduled starter, will instead start Game 1, while Pablo L\u00f3pez will start the second game for the Twins.\n\nDavid Festa, who started two games while Chris Paddack was on the injured list, will rejoin the team from Class AAA St. Paul and be available as the designated 27th man on the roster. Festa, who has pitched in relief only nine times in his four-year professional career, will be available out of the bullpen in either game.\n\nWednesday's forecast also includes some morning and early afternoon showers. Though both teams have Thursday off, the Twins are hoping the doubleheader goes off as planned in order to rest Thursday after a cross-country flight to San Francisco, where they play this weekend.\n\nBack in Minneapolis, the Twins' scouting staff is hard at work finalizing its draft board for this year's amateur draft, which begins Sunday night in Arlington, Texas, and for 20 rounds runs through Tuesday.\n\nThe work is a little easier, a little more joyful, Baldelli said, when a player like Brooks Lee, the Twins' first-round pick just two summers ago, arrives in the major leagues and makes such a big impact so quickly.\n\n\"Our guys, our organization, loved Brooks from the start. Pretty much all of our guys loved him, watched him all spring,\" Baldelli said of the rookie infielder, who has 11 hits and eight RBI in his first six games with the Twins. \"It's great for the entire organization when you have a guy pegged a certain way, both on and off the field, specifically his makeup and everything that goes into making him a very good player. And then he shows up and it's all of that and more. That's a really good feeling.\"\n\nSo is working the draft, said Baldelli, who helped the Tampa Bay Rays scout players after his playing career ended.\n\n\"I love the draft. It's actually a really fun time. You get to sit in the room for 12 straight hours for five or six days in a row. Sweat it out, the swampy meeting feeling you get, maybe you had time to shower that morning, maybe you didn't, but you're in the room,\" Baldelli said. Even now, he said, \"I bother everyone. I text them, bother them, ask them what's going on. Throw a nugget in there that I probably shouldn't have, but I do. It's great.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_miller@startribune.com", "name": "Phil Miller", "type": "author",

The understudy is a quick learner as a replicator of Lewis' impact. With 11 hits in his first six games (second-most behind Kirby Puckett in franchise history) and eight runs batted in (most in franchise history in that debuting span), Lee and the rest of the Twins are significantly lessening the blow of the latest Lewis setback.\n\nBut as I talked about on Tuesday's Daily Delivery podcast, the short-term isn't even the best news. The Twins and their fans can now allow themselves to imagine a time when both Lee and Lewis are healthy and punishing opponents with their bats, baseball IQs and all-around games.\n\nNeither of them figure to do it at their natural position -- shortstop -- for a long time. But that's because the Twins have a veteran All-Star and resurgent talent already occupying that spot in Carlos Correa, which only adds to the good vibes about the future.\n\nOh and Miranda, who can play third or first base, is hitting .332. That would be good for second in the AL batting race if he wasn't still a handful of plate appearances shy of qualifying. If Edouard Julien (seventh in the rookie of the year voting last year) can get himself sorted out in St. Paul after starting the year with a dreaded second-year slump, the Twins will have a surplus of infielders capable of terrorizing opposing pitchers for years to come.\n\nLee's early arrival (small sample size aside) -- at age 23 and just two years after being chosen with the No. 8 overall pick -- feels like an embarrassment of riches. He absolutely looks the part, including a dramatic but calm go-ahead single in the 11th inning of Monday's win over Chicago.\n\nAlmost all of his fielding work so far has come at third base, filling in for Lewis.

Bailey Ober, on the other hand, didn't even allow a hit until the fifth inning.\n\nThe contrasting beginnings, though, don't reflect the game's conclusion.\n\nFedde escaped without allowing a run in any of his five innings, while Ober surrendered three runs, including Luis Robert Jr.'s 416-foot home run, and took the loss, 3-1 at Guaranteed Rate Park.\n\nThe defeat, in the first game of a doubleheader, was the White Sox's first in nine games against the Twins this season. Pablo L\u00f3pez was scheduled to face Chicago's Drew Thorpe in the second game.\n\nThe Twins' first-inning failure seemed to energize Fedde, who never allowed another Twin to advance past first base. He retired Jos\u00e9 Miranda on a shallow fly ball to center field, Carlos Santana on a strikeout, and Brooks Lee on a forceout a second base. The Twins considered challenging the call -- Trevor Larnach seemed to arrive simultaneously with Nicky Lopez's throw -- but chose not to, ending the inning.\n\nThe Twins, who have averaged nearly seven runs per game in July, scored only once, when Matt Wallner lined reliever Jordan Leasure's first pitch of the seventh inning into the seats in right field.\n\nThat home run marked the 27th consecutive game in which a Twin has homered, tying them with the 2019-20 Astros and 2002 Rangers for the third-longest such streak in major-league history.

The Yanks have dropped Rodon's last four starts, with his ERA jumping from 2.93 to 4.45 in the process. He's given up 31 hits and 23 earned runs across 19.0 innings in that stretch.\n\nWhile Ryan Pepiot (4.40 ERA) hasn't been great for the Rays this season, betting on the Yankees is extremely risky business right now - especially when they're favored.\n\nUntil Rodon turns things around, he's a must fade, as he's taken New York out of games early by allowing five or more runs in three of his last four outings.\n\nDean Kremer OVER 4.5 Strikeouts (-130)\n\nBaltimore Orioles starter Dean Kremer returned to action after a lengthy stint on the injured list on July 3, pitching five shutout innings while striking out eight batters.\n\nHe only threw 83 pitches, but I think the righty is undervalued at home against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday.\n\nThe Cubbies have struck out a ton - 8.95 times per game - ranking 23rd in the league. Kremer has picked up at least five punch outs in six of his 10 outings so far in 2024, putting him in a solid position to clear this prop.\n\nMinnesota Twins Moneyline (-166) vs. Chicago White Sox\n\nThe Minnesota Twins are on a three-game winning streak, taking down the Chicago White Sox on Monday night - a bet I had suggested in our MLB Best Bets column.\n\nNow, they'll send Bailye Ober to the mound against Erick Fedde on Tuesday. While Ober actually has a worse ERA than Fedde this season, the Twins have a better record (9-8) when Ober is on the mound than the White Sox do with Fedde (7-11).\n\nPlus, I think the big advantage in this game comes from the bullpen. The White Sox are just 27th in Major League Baseball in bullpen ERA (4.59 ERA) while the Twins are one of the best 'pens in the league with a 3.63 ERA.\n\nGiven Chicago's struggles this season, I don't mind taking the Twins to win again.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Walk-Off Wagers: MLB Best Bets Today (Take Rays Over Yankees, Dean Kremer Prop on Tuesday).", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_dewey@miamiherald.com", "name": "Peter Dewey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Rod\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Rod\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Kremer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dean Kremer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Fedde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erick Fedde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/5z2fsn/picture289875259/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/1c77c317-7e0f-4e7f-9b69-16db088559e2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714735", "eventUri": "eng-9714735", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1239, "textEnd": 1245}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

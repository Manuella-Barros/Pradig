On the Spectator, I think we would have closed on that deal. We had the ability to do so. We were just being good citizens.\"\n\nTalking at the WSJ CEO Council Summit in London, Zucker said that in hindsight he would also have structured the Telegraph deal to use less money from the Middle East.\n\nIMI is controlled by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, although RedBird IMI is managed out of the US and had promised editorial independence for the newspaper group.\n\n\"We should have structured the deal differently and changed the percentage of ownership of each of the entities that was within RedBird,\" he said. \"I think it probably would have would have sufficed [to do the deal].\"\n\nThe risk of a foreign state owning and influencing the Telegraph and the Spectator sparked widespread concern among UK politicians, who ultimately moved to change the law to block the deal by limiting state involvement in British newspaper companies.\n\nRedBird IMI has now kicked off the auction to find new owners for the titles, Zucker confirmed, after permission was granted by ministers last week.\n\nHe said the level of interest from potential buyers was \"robust\", adding \"we've actually been a little surprised at the number of incoming calls that we've gotten\".\n\nZucker added: \"It probably wouldn't surprise people to know those who are interested in the UK, but I think the thing that has surprised us is those who have called us from outside the UK.\"\n\nZucker said RedBird IMI would continue to look for new deals. The group is expected to complete the \u00a31.1bn acquisition of British TV production company All3Media next week.\n\n\"On the entertainment side, we feel we have a nice suite of assets, we'll continue to look for others that can give us quality programming. We're also going to continue to look for opportunities in the news and information space.\"\n\nZucker, a former CNN boss, said the group would consider looking at the network if it was ever put up for sale by its owner Warner Bros Discovery but that it was \"not something that we've ever looked at in any formal way [or] in any manner\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009As far as I know, it's not for sale\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Music_Industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Music Industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zucker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_Media_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegraph Media Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansour_bin_Zayed_Al_Nahyan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery and John Malone's cable and telecom giant Liberty Global. The deal gives the new owner control over a big production business across scripted and unscripted series as well as theatrical movie titles. That deal \"will close next Tuesday,\" Zucker said on Thursday.\n\nAnd he signaled more deal appetite. While RedBird IMI has built \"a very nice portfolio on the entertainment content side,\" he said there is more room for deals that bring in more quality content. He also expressed interest in deals in the news and information space, \"especially in the digital news and information space.\" In this context, he mentioned RedBird IMI's \"tiny\" Front Office Sports, which covers the intersection of sports and business, as a good example. \"We'd like to add to that, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities around the globe.\" And he emphasized: \"I'm not trying to run away from news at all.\"\n\nOverall, he said that \"we'd obviously like to keep going\" about his team's deal and investment plans ahead.\n\nEarlier this year, RedBird IMI acquired a stake in Media Res, the studio behind the Apple TV+ shows The Morning Show and Pachinko, among other projects, which was founded by former HBO executive Michael Ellenberg.\n\nLaunched in late 2022 with a $1 billion war chest backed by RedBird Capital and Abu Dhabi's IMI, RedBird IMI has the mandate to pursue investments in the news, entertainment and sports sectors. Led by Zucker, the firm has previously also struck deals to launch the nonfiction studio EverWonder, as well as the sports industry news outlet Front Office Sports. Meanwhile, RedBird Capital has also invested in the likes of Skydance Media, which has been looking to acquire Paramount Global, the YES Network, and Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's Artists Equity.\n\nZucker on Thursday was also asked about RedBird IMI recently having to abandon its plans to acquire the conservative daily newspaper The Daily Telegraph and magazine The Spectator amid political and media opposition to a deal because of the firm's Abu Dhabi financiers. He called the two \"terrific brands,\" noting that brands of \"such stature\" do \"rarely\" become available. The Telegraph is \"quite a good business,\" likely better than people realize, but could have benefited from more investment after a period of under-investment over the past decade to help it grow in the U.K. and globally, including in the U.S., he explained.\n\n\"We'll move on and do the next thing,\" the executive also shared. Asked what mistakes could have been avoided, he said the company tried to be \"good citizens\" and therefore didn't close a deal for The Spectator right away. He also suggested the Telegraph deal could have been structured differently and \"changed the percentage of ownership of each of the entities that was within RedBird IMI\" to potentially get it through. \"We didn't fully appreciate the need to do either of those moves at that time,\" Zucker acknowledged.\n\nHe shared that the two assets are now being shopped and could be sold together or separately. \"The interest has actually been pretty robust,\" he said. A surprise has been interest from players from outside the U.K., Zucker mentioned without disclosing details. The process could play out over two to three months, he suggested.\n\nZucker said that in his past jobs he was always looking at M&A opportunities and interested in entrepreneurial approaches. What does he miss most about his former career? \"Leading a big organization,\" Zucker shared.\n\nNo surprise that he then faced big M&A questions. Asked if he could end up running CBS if it gets sold in a Paramount Global sale, Zucker said: \"That is so premature that it's not even something that I'm thinking about at this point,\" he answered. \"I don't know, none of us knows what's going to happen with Paramount, and I'm not involved in any of those conversations or negotiations. So I don't know what's going to happen there.\"\n\nIn general, though, he shared, \"I would take a look at anything that came before me. I mean, obviously, I have a lot of experience doing things like that.\"\n\nHe also shared that his team has not looked at buying CNN so far, saying: \"I know that for a lot of people, this is how the movie ends: I should come back in and buy CNN. It's not something that we've contemplated at this point. It's not something that we've ever looked at, in any formal way, in any manner.\" And he added: \"CNN is not for sale, as far as I know.\" He added that, \"of course, we would look at it,\" if it came up for sale, but the same would be true for the Wall Street Journal and any \"really great news and information brands, big or small.\"\n\nHow does he feel about his time at CNN? Zucker said he was \"incredibly proud\" of his nine years there overall, but \"of course, we made mistakes,\" including in covering Donald Trump, he reiterated past comments. \"Over the course of that campaign ... did we give him too much free air time uninterrupted, covered his rallies too much? Yes, we did. Do I think that's why he became President of the United States? No.\" Zucker said, highlighting: \"There was a large swath of the United States that actually was quite interested in voting for Donald Trump.\"\n\nAsked about his take on NBA rights and whether Warner Bros. Discovery should buy them, Zucker said, \"the NBA is incredibly important to TNT and the Turner networks,\" but emphasized that he doesn't have any insight on the state of talks. \"Everything's easy in hindsight,\" even if outsiders make many things sound simple, he emphasized. \"It's really easy for people to throw stones from the outside,\" Zucker added. \"Everybody is a critic. Social media makes sure of that.\"\n\nZucker late in his session also answered a question about journalism, calling journalists \"pains in the asses\" by nature. \"Even in good times, newsrooms are places of discontent and people rising up.\"\n\nWhat is a top executive's role? \"I'm a firm believer that you do have to hear your employees and hear your employee base, but I also don't think you can let the inmates run the asylum,\" he replied. \"Leadership matters.\" And that sometimes means \"unpopular decisions,\" including four to five really difficult ones a year.\n\nZucker was interviewed by Jessica Toonkel, deputy media editor at The Wall Street Journal.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georg_szalai@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Georg Szalai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Music_Industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Music Industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zucker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All3Media", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All3Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spectator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Spectator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John C.

He said he would have closed the deal for the Spectator, which the group owns, \"right away\" as that was not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as the Telegraph.\n\nHe said that RedBird IMI, a partnership backed by the UAE's vice-president, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and the US investment firm RedBird Capital Partners, had not done so because it had agreed the Telegraph and Spectator deals would go through at the same time and it was working with the regulators. \"We were being good citizens,\" he said.\n\nZucker said he would have also \"structured the deal differently\" by changing the percentage of the owners of the entities that were within the RedBird IMI partnership. \"Looking back in hindsight we did not fully appreciate the need to do either of these moves at that time,\" he said.\n\nThe planned RedBird IMI takeover of the Telegraph, widely seen as the house journal of the Conservative party, had been fiercely opposed by many Tory MPs and peers who raised concerns about free speech.\n\nThe UAE, which provides the financial backing for 75% of RedBird IMI, has been criticised in the past for breaches of press freedom. The concerns prompted the government to draw up the legislation which is expected to become law in the coming weeks.\n\nRedBird IMI effectively took control of the Telegraph newspapers and the Spectator magazine in December when it repaid the debts of their owners, the Barclay family, including a \u00a3600m loan against the titles. Its withdrawal from a full takeover of the business will trigger a fresh round of bidding from interested parties.\n\nZucker said that, since the sale process started last week, \"interest has been pretty robust\" from potential bidders including from those outside the UK. \"We are confident there is enough serious interest in this and we will do well,\" he said, adding of the sales process: \"In the next two to three months it'll work itself out.\"\n\nLast year's auction for the Telegraph attracted interest from more than 20 parties but was halted after RedBird IMI made its proposed offer.\n\nInterested bidders this time are expected to include DMGT, which owns the Daily Mail, and Paul Marshall, the hedgefund founder and backer of GB News, who has already shown interest in the Telegraph. The Rupert Murdoch-owned News UK has has been linked to a deal for the Spectator.\n\nRedBird is being advised by the banks Raine and Robey Warshaw - which employs the former chancellor George Osborne - in the sales process.\n\nZucker said RedBird IMI had made a planned bid for the Telegraph and Spectator because they were \"terrific brands\", and such assets \"rarely become available\". He added that the Telegraph was \"a good business\" but had suffered from a \"serious lack of investment\" in the past decade. RedBird IMI's plan had been to help expand the Telegraph globally, particularly in the US, he said.\n\nThe UAE backed consortium has made a number of acquisitions including a \u00a31.15bn deal to buy All3Media, the production company behind Fleabag and the Traitors. All3Media has more than 50 different labels and has produced some of the most popular TV shows of recent years, including include Squid Game: The Challenge, Midsomer Murders and Call the Midwife.\n\nZucker said the All3Media deal closed next week and that RedBird would continue to look for suitable acquisitions.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

In fact, those tenants raved on the roof the very day that Peak Properties took over management of their building. \"I chose to break up the party versus join it,\" he says with a smile.\n\nEvery day is different for Zucker. But that's what he finds exciting about the industry.\n\nZucker first came to learn about property management through an ex-relative. After that relationship ended, he worked a series of odd jobs, delivering pizzas, selling kitchen cabinets, and slinging BBQ at the original Bub City. \"I hustled,\" he says, before he pivoted back to real estate, renting apartments on the weekends and working full time for a retail brokerage firm. After a client asked him why he wasn't managing apartments on his own, Zucker listed the pros and cons and ultimately decided to start his own management company.\n\nHe was just 28 years old when he founded Peak Properties. At that time, in 1998, it was just a basement office with two accounts, a telephone and a whiteboard.\n\nToday, Peak Properties manages almost 10,000 units, mainly in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs. They collect over $200 million a year in rents and employ approximately 130 people, plus a team of 50 independent brokers.\n\nZucker views property management as a triangle with connected points -- accounting, management and leasing, united by customer service -- and Peak Properties handles all those areas. They manage residential buildings for all types of clients: smaller owners of property, high-net-worth individuals and larger institutions such as banks and insurance companies.\n\nMeanwhile, a company subsidiary, branded as Cross Street, handles leasing and marketing. \"As we've grown,\" Zucker says the marketing division \"needed its own identity\" and describes its relationship to Peak Properties as a \"strategic alliance.\"\n\nEven with a streamlined process, though, problems arise. \"You are in a constant state of addressing issues,\" Zucker says. (In the case of the smoker, literally, \"putting out fires.\") So, the business becomes about addressing issues in a way that eases the burden for property owners.\n\nFor example, during a recent hot spell in March, many residents called Peak Properties because their buildings' air conditioning was not turned on yet. Due to how those properties were built, there was no way to turn the air on early, per Chicago's Residential and Landlord Tenant Ordinance. Zucker says, \"A tenant might call the city, call you direct, email everyone in your office and start a WhatsApp group for the property, but there is literally nothing you can do.\" So, how does a property manager deal with that?\n\n\"By being patient and suggesting alternative solutions,\" says Zucker, \"and explaining to residents exactly what's going on. You get in front of the issue and have an answer to the question before they ask it.\" In March, Zucker said Peak Properties set some of those hot residents up in an Airbnbs or hotels or provided them with fans.\n\nTake another classic example: a tenant who is not paying rent. According to Zucker, someone currently under eviction in one of their buildings has filed for bankruptcy and is now complaining about issues with their unit. In that case, Zucker says, \"The solution is you have a court date, go to court, and you spend money there to solve the problem. Part of our job is dealing with the politics of the city of Chicago.\"\n\n\"Property owners are dealing with the assessor, they're worried about crime, they're worried about tenants, they're worried about insurance, they are worried about normal work orders and capital items. But we try to do the worrying for them,\" Zucker says. \"The hard way is usually the right way.\"\n\nEven more recently, Peak Properties began handling fallout from the sudden Foxtrot grocery chain closure. They manage apartments above certain Foxtrots and, when the stores closed without warning, food risked rotting. There was also no garbage or utility plan in place, as Foxtrot oversaw that. \"We're dealing with the relationship between commercial [spaces] and the tenants above,\" Zucker said. In this case, Peak Properties needed to engage counsel and, per the lease, legally entered the building to donate perishables to a food bank. They are now working with attorneys on behalf of the property owners, and Foxtrot, regarding the future of the space.\n\nAll of that may not sound very glamorous. But it's rewarding for Zucker. \"I've met an inordinate amount of great people through [property management]. Great residents, vendors, brokers, bankers and company executives. Many doors have opened to me, but it's all through hard work and patience. [It's about] the ability to take losses without going crazy.\" Zucker says. \"In property management, one needs to think like an optimist yet prepare like a pessimist.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagoagentmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Agent Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chicago_agent@chicagoagentmagazine.com", "name": "Chicago Agent", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbecue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toilet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-net-worth_individual", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-net-worth individual"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Property_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Property Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://chicagoagentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/zucker-mike-featured.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554432", "eventUri": "eng-9554432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

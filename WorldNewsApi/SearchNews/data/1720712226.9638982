{"id": 231958878, "title": "Convicted rapist Wayne Wilmot released after almost three decades in jail", "text": "Convicted rapist Wayne Wilmot has been released from prison after almost three decades behind bars. The 51-year-old was only 15 when he and four other teenagers were involved in the kidnapping, rape and murder of 20-year-old Sydney bank teller Janine Balding in 1988. Wilmot, who was one of the men jailed over the crime, was handed an almost 10-year sentence over his role as an accessory to her abduction and assault. After he was released on parole, Wilmot attacked four other women in the late 1990s and was sent back to prison. Balding's family was made aware that Wilmot would be released today and shared concerns with victim advocates that he may re-offend. \"It has placed enormous stress on the victims and they're quite churned up about it,\" victims' advocate Howard Brown told 9News Sydney. \"Their real concern is not for their own safety, it's for the safety of others. \"Because they've already experienced what Wilmot is capable of and they don't want anyone else to have to experience a similar episode.\" Since his release, Wilmot is living under strict conditions in a supervised facility. An application for an extended supervision order will be heard in court later this month.

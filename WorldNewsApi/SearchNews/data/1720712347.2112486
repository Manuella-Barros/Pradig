{"id": 231993658, "title": "Azerbaijani banker's wife says \u00a315m Knightsbridge home bought legitimately", "text": "A banker\u2019s wife who splashed out \u00a316 million at Harrods has told the High Court how she moved to London after being kidnapped and held in a tiny hole underground for weeks as part of an attempt to stop her Knightsbridge home being seized as the proceeds of crime. Zamira Hajiyeva is accused by the National Crime Agency of buying her \u00a315 million Walton Street home and a multi-million pound golf club in Berkshire with a fortune plundered by her husband Jahangir from the state bank in Azerbaijan. He has since been jailed in Baku for his crimes and the agency, which has already used so-called \u201cMcMafia laws\u201d to serve Mrs Hajiyeva with Britain\u2019s first Unexplained Wealth Order, is now trying to strip her of both properties on the grounds that they were acquired with illicit money. But in a statement to a new High Court hearing, Mrs Hajiyeva repeated earlier denials of wrongdoing and insisted that her \u201cextremely dynamic\u201d husband had funded her home and the golf club out of legitimate wealth first generated during the \u201cWild West\u201d conditions that existed in Azerbaijan at the time. She also gave details of her own background, saying that she was a languages graduate who had taught Russian literature and language, before a \u201cterrifying\u201d kidnap in 2005, which she said had involved death threats and \u201cscarred me for life\u201d, prompted her to move to London for safety. She said the incident began as she was \u201cgrabbed from behind as I approached my car\u201d and bundled by three men into a waiting car with a driver as she tried to kick out to defend herself. \u201cThey pushed me to the floor of the car and put a bag or something over my head. They also put handcuffs on me before driving off,\u201d Mrs Hajiyeva told the High Court. \u201cI could not see, but I could hear. After a while, we stopped, and I was transferred from one car to another. They placed me in the back of the second vehicle, with \u2018the bag\u2019 still over my head. \u201cThey pushed something against my head, which felt like a gun and told me to just sit and not move. I was terrified, I did not know who these people were or where I was going, and I did not know if I would see my husband and children again. \u201cI was taken to a place outside Baku, I was put in a \u2018room\u2019 which was in fact a 1.5 metre by 1.5 metre hole in the ground under the basement of a building. It was so small I could neither stand up straight nor lie down. I spent 28 days in that hole. \u201cThe door was permanently locked, and I was spoken to through a hatch in the door. There was no toilet, only a basin, a bucket and a cold- water pipe, like a hose, with a small hole in the ground for evacuating waste. \u201cMy captors would give me food once a day through the hatch.. A light was on 24 hours a day, except when they opened the hatch.. so I could not see their faces. \u201cThere was loud music playing the entire time.. which felt like I was being tortured. I soon lost complete track of time and did not know what day of the week it was, or even whether it was day or night. \u201cWhile I was being held, my captors attempted to extort money from my husband, and I was told that if he did not cooperate, I would be killed.\u201d Mrs Hajiyeva said her ordeal was ended by an armed operation by Azerbaijan\u2019s national security ministry in which one of her captors was killed outside where she was being held. She added that she believed that \u201csome of those who were responsible for my abduction remain in senior positions in Azerbaijan\u201d and that her kidnapping had \u201cproved to be the start of what I believe were a series of attempts at extortion of my husband\u201d. She claimed this had culminated with what she alleged was the politically motivated wrongful conviction of her husband for defrauding the International Bank of Azerbaijan, where he had worked as chairman for many years. \u201cI believe that my husband was the victim of a political drive to remove him from his position and seize his assets,\u201d Mrs Hajiyeva said in her High Court statement. \u201cHe was an honest businessman and banker who had a long-standing reputation and was widely recognised for having led the International Bank of Azerbaijan professionally and to great success.\u201d On her husband\u2019s business activities, Mrs Hajiyeva said that although she had not questioned the source of his wealth when the couple met in the 1990s or discussed his later banking career, Mr Hajiyev was a \u201csuccessful entrepreneur\u201d who had used his business acumen to make money from importing household goods and other items when communist era restrictions disappeared. \u201cThere was a boom in trade followed the fall of communism in eastern Europe and this was exactly the type of business (import / export) that anyone with a bit of cash could enter at the time,\u201d Mrs Hajiyeva said in her court statement. \u201cThere was a huge flow of western household appliances coming into former Soviet countries like Azerbaijan, my husband had studied for his MBA in the United States, and he obviously saw the potential for trade in modern household goods and electronics, in addition to commodities such as spirits and flour. \u201cThis was the early to mid-1990s in Azerbaijan. It was a bit of \u2018Wild West\u2019 and some people who had access to Western know-how and business training were able to make a lot of money.\u201d Mrs Hajiyeva added that her husband had also had a \u201croad construction business in Azerbaijan\u201d and a \u201ccotton production operation in Uzbekistan\u201d and that the absence of documentation about his \u201centrepreneurial activities\u201d reflected the \u201creality of life in Azerbaijan\u201d in an era when \u201cthere was not the same requirement to keep records, or the same ability to keep electronic documents.\u201d \u201cHe was in my eyes a successful entrepreneur who loved me and had a great future ahead of him,\u201d Mrs Hajiyeva said as she described the early years of the couple\u2019s romance which resulted in their marriage in 1997. \u201cAt no stage did anyone question or challenge the fact that he was wealthy. Nor did any-one think it was inconsistent with his employment [as a banker] given his wider business interests.\u201d Mrs Hajiyeva\u2019s statement to the High Court was revealed during a case management hearing ahead of a scheduled trial next year to determine whether her home and the Mill Ride golf club in Berkshire should be handed over to the NCA as the proceeds of crime. The agency\u2019s barrister, Jonathan Hall KC, told the court that Mrs Hajiyeva was withholding information about the source of the money used to buy her home and the golf club. He also accused her of trying to delay proceedings by asking the court for more time for her lawyers to be able to seek access to Mr Hajiyev in his Baku prison cell to obtain his explanation about the purchases. But the judge, Mr Justice Saini, agreed to grant a short extension to the deadline for Mrs Hajiyeva to submit her evidence about the source of the funds to the court, while warning that if she failed to submit her case by that time then she would be barred from doing so at all. The case was adjourned. Separate forfeiture proceedings at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court over Mrs Hajiyeva\u2019s lavish jewellery collection have also still to be completed. The action against Mrs Hajiyeva follow the NCA\u2019s decision in 2018 to issue her with Britain\u2019s first Unexplained Wealth Order under new powers dubbed \u201cMcMafia law\u201d introduced to target illicit wealth. She has denied wrongdoing throughout and continues to live in her Walton Street home in Knightsbridge. None of her assets have been seized so far despite the litigation against her costing vast sums believed to total several millions of pounds.", "summary": "<p>A banker\u2019s wife who splashed out \u00a316 million at Harrods has told the High Court how she moved to London after being kidnapped and held in a tiny hole underground for weeks as part of an attempt to stop her Knightsbridge home being seized as the proceeds of crime.</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/mcmafia-laws-zamira-hajiyeva-knightsbridge-b1162932.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2022/06/14/11/COURTS%20McMafia%20%2007472244.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:00:46", "author": "Martin Bentham", "authors": ["Martin Bentham"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.849}

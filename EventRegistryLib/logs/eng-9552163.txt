The transcript was released to the media on Wednesday.\n\nThe interview came about three weeks after Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam publicly rebutted an article by The Economist that he said \"sneered\" at Singapore's political succession.\n\nHere are five highlights of the interview, that touched on topics such as global and regional geopolitics, immigration, the Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others (CMIO) racial mix, identity politics and the leadership style of the 4G team:\n\nOn the global geopolitical scene, Mr Wong said that the situation could remain \"messy for quite a few years\" as the world transits into a multi-polar one after the ending of the \"uni-polar moment for America\".\n\nAnd while efforts have been made to stabilise the relationship between China and the United States, \"mutual suspicion and distrust\" remains between the two countries.\n\nIf things deteriorate sharply, it \"would be costly for both (China and US) and for the rest of the world\".\n\nMr Wong reiterated his view that in the context of the rivalry between the US and China: \"We are pro-Singapore.\"\n\nAsked how Singapore intends to deal with a possible worsening in technological and economical bifurcation between the two, Mr Wong warned that the world must be careful about using economic tools for geopolitical purposes.\n\n\"If we are not careful, it will have profound implications to the global economy but worse still, for global stability,\" he said.\n\nSingapore, with its very diverse population, is \"constantly influenced by pressures\" from around the world, said Mr Wong in response to how geopolitical tensions globally play out in Singapore.\n\nWhile Singapore \"values (the) linkages\" that the ethnic groups here have with different parts of the global community, \"when we do things, it has to be on the basis of our national interest,\" said Mr Wong.\n\nThis applies to all global crises, be it the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing onslaught in Gaza.\n\nIn response to a question on the rise in identity politics in the West, Mr Wong said: \"We do see some of it (identity politics) here in Singapore.\"\n\nBut Singapore, he said, has always maintained a \"very different\" approach that has worked well: Expanding common ground, and compromising when there are differences.\n\n\"And compromise cannot be a bad word, compromise cannot be an issue of dishonour to my tribe or to my identity. Because if that is dishonour, then it is all-out war,\" he said.\n\n\"Not every single group may get everything that they want. But by working together by engaging, by not accentuating our differences but finding common ground, it is an approach that has worked better for all of us.\"\n\nMr Wong said Singapore will always remain an open economy, welcoming of foreign inputs and professionals that can complement the Singapore core, add to the economy and society and generate a \"net plus for all of us in Singapore\".\n\nAsked if he could imagine a situation where citizens become a minority, Mr Wong replied: \"No, not at all.\"\n\nThe Economist asked why Singapore maintains a \"tacit target\" of the population mix when it comes to migration, instead of becoming a \"post-racial\" society.\n\nMr Wong said that while Singapore would like to evolve into a society that is \"race blind\", the nation is also \"very realistic about these things\".\n\n\"These instincts of race are very primal, they are very emotive, and it can be stirred up at any point in time,\" he said, citing examples of how the race or religion card was played up in recent years.\n\nOn how the governing style of 4G (fourth generation) leaders would differ from their predecessors, Mr Wong said that Singapore politics in Singapore has evolved from the days of a dominant People's Action Party (PAP) under the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nHe said the days when the PAP was dominant \"are over and we cannot go back to that period\".\n\nSingapore has a \"highly educated, very sophisticated, very discerning\" electorate, whose majority would like to see the PAP remain in power yet also want more opposition voices in Parliament.\n\n\"This is the new reality of our political landscape, which means that as a party, for me now, eventually as Prime Minister, eventually leading the party into elections, we will have to do our best to engage Singaporeans, we will have to do our best to involve them in decisions that they care deeply about, and in shaping our future.\"\n\nAsked if he has the \"iron\" in him to govern Singapore -- a reference to a quote by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew on governing here -- Mr Wong said that when the time comes to take hard decisions, he would do so, \"so long as the decision is in the interest of Singapore and Singaporeans\".\n\nElaborating on his leadership style, Mr Wong said he would get the insights and perspectives from those around him, before \"thinking about what makes for the best decisions and outcomes for Singapore '', even if those decisions are not \"the most popular\".\n\nMr Wong said it has been a \"long-standing... very valuable\" Singapore tradition to retain some of its more experienced ministers whenever a leadership transition happens.\n\n\"It has never been a problem with preventing the new prime minister from setting the tone of leadership and making his own decisions,\" said Mr Wong, when asked if having Mr Lee Hsien Loong in the next Cabinet would hinder the 4G leaders from \"exerting authority\".\n\nMr Wong said tapping Mr Lee's experience and international network is part and parcel of how he, as a leader, would harness the \"collective energies\" of every team member and every Singaporean to give the nation the best chances to \"shine ever more brightly in a dark and troubled world\".\n\nMr Wong said that as with the past political handovers, there will be a transition for the new Prime Minister to take over as secretary-general of the PAP.\n\nCapping off the interview, Mr Wong said that what has happened in the last 60 years for Singapore \"has been nothing short of a miracle\".\n\n\"And my mission is to keep this miracle going for as long as I can. And to make sure our little red dot shines brightly for as long as possible.\"", "source": {"uri": "todayonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Identity politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(Singapore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Shanmugam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K.

He was responding to questions about whether he possesses the 'iron' that Lee Kuan Yew had deemed essential for governing Singapore.\n\nRegarding PM Lee taking on the role of senior minister in his new Cabinet, Mr Wong said this is a \"long-standing Singapore tradition\" that has never prevented the new prime minister from setting the tone and making his own decisions.\n\nHe does not envision any difficulties on this front, he added.\n\n\"Each time we have a leadership transition, we do not just kick out all the older ministers and then have a completely new team come in. We value the more experienced ministers, and we invite them to continue contributing in different ways, in their own ways.\"\n\nSimilarly, he will take over as secretary-general of the PAP in due course, Mr Wong said.\n\nDuring the interview, Mr Wong also touched on his leadership philosophy, which involves a blend of firmness in decision-making with an openness to diverse perspectives. He emphasized his methodological approach to meetings and decision-making processes: \"I listen carefully to everyone's views. When I go into a meeting, I do not start off assuming that I know all the answers. I want to get people's insights, I want to get people's perspectives, eventually thinking about what makes for the best decisions and outcomes for Singapore.\"\n\nExamples of difficult decisions cited by Mr Wong included the recent hike in the goods and services tax from 7% to 9%, and the implementation of stringent social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. These decisions, according to Mr Wong, showcase his capability to prioritize the nation's long-term interests over short-term popularity.\n\nThis interview comes in the wake of pointed criticism from Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam towards The Economist for its commentary on Singapore's political succession.\n\nOn 19 April, Mr Shanmugam took to Facebook to launch a fierce defense of Mr Wong and Singapore's political system in response to what he perceived as patronizing and biased coverage by The Economist.\n\nHe criticized the publication for its portrayal of Mr Wong as a \"compromise candidate\" and its broader skepticism about the transparency and fairness of Singapore's political succession.\n\nMr Shanmugam accused The Economist of maintaining a colonialist attitude towards Singapore, suggesting that British observers could not accept Singapore's success.\n\n\"They can't stand that a people they were accustomed to lecturing are now doing better than they are, across the board,\" Mr Shanmugam stated, contrasting Singapore's political stability with the UK's tumultuous political landscape post-Brexit.\n\nHe further highlighted Singapore's superior economic performance and societal metrics, such as healthcare, housing, education, public safety, and social cohesion, to underscore his argument. Mr Shanmugam's critique extended to the broader media landscape, where he claimed that Singapore's media is less influenced by media moguls compared to Britain, leading to more balanced and constructive journalism.\n\nIt is intriguing that Mr Wong chose to engage with The Economist for an interview on 6 May despite his colleague, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam, having previously criticized the publication for poor journalism less than a month ago. This could suggest that Mr Wong may not fully align with Mr Shanmugam's views, especially as he prepares to announce his reshuffled cabinet soon.", "source": {"uri": "gutzy.asia", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gutzy Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Action_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "People's Action Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Kuan Yew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister's_Office_(Singapore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Hsien Loong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Shanmugam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Lawrence Wong, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, will take the reins of the city-state's government on May 15th. The country does not churn through prime ministers: he will be just the fourth in its history as an independent nation since 1965. Mr Wong sat down with The Economist on May 6th.\n\nAged just 51, Mr Wong was born seven years into Singapore's existence as a nation. He is also more of an everyman than his predecessors. He is the first not to have attended an elite secondary school, and grew up on a public-housing estate.\n\nHis ascendancy marks a historical change in other ways. Lee Kuan Yew, the country's modern founding father, was prime minister until 1990. His eldest son, Lee Hsien Loong, took the reins in 2004. For the first time in the country's modern history, there is no member of the family either in charge or waiting in the wings to take over. Instead Mr Lee will remain in cabinet as senior minister, the same position conferred on his father after he stepped down as prime minister.\n\nAs a small and open economy, with large trade and financial links to the world, Singapore is buffeted by geopolitical forces more than most countries (see next story). Mr Wong compares two recent shocks and their effect on Singapore. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he notes, had a financial impact for Singapore. The country was alone in South-East Asia in instituting sanctions against Russia. Even without them, the hit to global energy prices had an impact, as Singapore imports all of its commodities: wholesale electricity prices there rose by almost half in 2022.\n\nBut while the economic impact was meaningful, the conflict has little emotional resonance in a country with limited links to either of the countries involved. The violence in Gaza, on the other hand, has little economic impact for the country, but is an issue of deep concern for many Singaporeans, especially the country's Muslim minority (see Banyan).\n\nBy contrast, the greatest geopolitical risk on the horizon -- a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait or in the South China Sea -- would have both a very large economic effect and a large emotional resonance for Singaporean citizens, Mr Wong notes. Singapore supports the status quo when it comes to Taiwan's status, he stresses: \"If any change were to happen, it has to be done in a way that's peaceful.\" The majority of Singapore's citizens are ethnically Chinese. Many still have family connections in the mainland, or feel a sense of kinship to the country of their ancestors. \"External events that happen seemingly far away, actually they are happening right here at our doorstep,\" he says.\n\nThe risk of military conflict in particular speaks to Singapore's delicate diplomatic balancing act between America and China. Mr Wong stresses that Singapore is not an ally of America, despite the two countries' close military links. The country has the second-largest number of military personnel based in America of any country in the world. But as relations between Washington and Beijing have worsened, remaining open to both of the two larger countries becomes more difficult. \"When a big country deals with a small country, the big country often doesn't realise how imposing they are,\" he says\n\nAn area in which Singapore's government stands out from the Western world is its management of the ethnic balance of its citizens, known as the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others model. The city attempts to keep its proportions -- roughly 75% Chinese, 14% Malay and 9% Indian -- relatively constant over time. Balances are also reflected at the level of the city's widespread public-housing estates, which are not permitted to stray too far from the country's ethnic makeup. \"We would like to be, to evolve into a society where we become race-blind, but we are also very realistic about these things,\" he says.\n\nOver the past six decades the ruling People's Action Party (), of which Mr Wong is a member, has made the case that the external dangers to Singapore justify its firm governance of the city. But in general elections in 2020, the centre-left Worker's Party won two of the country's multi-member constituencies, a first for any opposition group in the country's history. Those precincts have historically guaranteed that the 's vote share of over 60% is turned into even more overwhelming parliamentary majorities. \"While a majority today would like the to be in power...they would also like more opposition voices to be in parliament. So the opposition presence in parliament is here to stay,\" says Mr Wong.\n\nOne area where Singapore is changing is in the priorities of its young people, the issue on which Mr Wong is at his most animated. \"They would like to see a Singapore where we embrace broader definitions of success,\" he says. The island is famous for a hard-working culture, and the city's meritocratic ladder can be ruthless.\n\nBut any Singaporeans angling for a split with the political past will be disappointed. Mr Wong casts the decision to keep Mr Lee on as cabinet minister as a Singaporean tradition, and a way of keeping using the accumulated experience of the third generation of Singapore's leadership. He mentions the outgoing prime minister's international networks, a hint at the role Mr Lee might play in the future.\n\nMr Wong frames the challenge of his time in office as continuing the work of his predecessors. \"We've always seen ourselves as the underdog, we will always be the improbable, unlikely nation forged only through the collective will of our people,\" he says. \"My mission is to keep this miracle going for as long as I can.\" \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Later, he studied in the United States on a government scholarship and joined the civil service in 1997.\n\nDPM Wong noted that Singaporeans are \"discerning and wise voters\", adding: \"I have no doubt that at the end of the day, they will expect me to deliver on the things that they care about - delivering a better life, delivering better standards of living for themselves and their children.\"\n\nIf he and his team cannot meet these expectations and a better team arises, Singaporeans will choose accordingly, he said.\n\nDPM Wong added that the opposition presence in Parliament is here to stay, and that he does not assume that the PAP will automatically return to power after the next general election.\n\n\"We will have to do our best to engage Singaporeans, we will have to do our best to involve them in decisions that they care deeply about, and in shaping our future, which is why we started doing so in our Forward Singapore exercise, engaging Singaporeans a lot more, not just in hearing them out.\"", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "linette_lai@straitstimes.com", "name": "Linette Lai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_Pattern_Material", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disruptive Pattern Material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Singapore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Kuan Yew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Junior_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria Junior College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katong"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Action_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People's Action Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Hsien Loong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Parade", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Parade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marine Parade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/05/08/MCI01.jpg?VersionId=N0jl5vBptDcMVUqIHQ3LhVsJTcp8SqTI&h=2761a527", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552163", "eventUri": "eng-9552163", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 106, "textEnd": 112}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

You have the mindset that you're serving the corporation but without knowing, you slip into doing too much,\" Yeo, who is in his 50s, told Al Jazeera.\n\nYeo is among a growing cohort of Singaporeans who are seeking to reimagine the Singapore Dream as being less about achieving material success and more about finding meaning and fulfilment.\n\nSingapore's prime minister-in-waiting, Lawrence Wong, is among those who argue the time has come for the city-state's residents to look beyond money and work.\n\nAfter the launch of a report on residents' views on the future of the social compact in October, Wong said Singaporeans today \"no longer talk so much about the five Cs\" - referring to a condominium, car, cash, credit card and country club membership.\n\n\"From our engagements, it is also clear the Singapore Dream is more than just material success,\" Wong, who is deputy prime minister and finance minister, said at the launch of a festival based on the findings of a 16-month consultation involving more than 200,000 Singaporeans.\n\n\"It is also about fulfilment, meaning and purpose in what we do. This is not a top-down government agenda. This is very much a shared consensus, a co-created road map for our next round of nation building.\"\n\nSingapore, whose government tightly controls displays of dissent and political activism by the population, is on the cusp of a major political transition.\n\nCurrent Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 72 -- the eldest son of Singapore's founding leader Lee Kuan Yew -- is this month stepping down from the helm of the tiny city-state after two decades in office.\n\nOn May 15, Wong will be sworn in as Singapore's fourth prime minister.\n\nUnder Lee Kuan Yew's leadership, Singapore transitioned from poverty to prosperity within a generation of gaining its independence from Malaysia in 1965.\n\nToday, Singapore has a higher gross domestic product (GDP) per capita than the United States and its residents enjoy some of the highest living standards on earth.\n\nWhile Singapore's success has been credited to a culture of competition and hard work, the city-state has also gained a notorious reputation as one of the most overworked, stressed-out and strait-laced societies in the world.\n\nBut there are signs that priorities are beginning to shift.\n\nIn a survey carried out in October by the Institute of Policy Studies, more than half of Singaporeans said they would accept lower pay or a less senior role to benefit their family or personal life.\n\nWong, who gained plaudits for his handling of the country's pandemic response, has been seen as Lee's successor since April 2022, when the long-dominant People's Action Party (PAP) chose him as head of its team of \"4G\", or fourth generation, leaders.\n\nA former technocrat, Wong emerged as a dark horse for the premiership after the PAP's first choice, Heng Swee Keat, a former central bank chief and education minister, stepped aside in 2021 citing age and health issues.\n\nWong, a self-professed fan of playing the guitar and listening to rock, blues and soul, has admitted to not harbouring any grand political ambitions and has been portrayed in international media as being more relatable than as is typical of Singapore's governing elites.\n\nA spokesperson for Wong declined a request for comment, citing his busy schedule.\n\nDonald Low, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology who studies Singaporean governance, said that Singapore cannot simply prioritise GDP growth or emulate other more advanced societies or economies going forward.\n\n\"This is not because Singapore has nothing to learn from other countries. Rather, it's because Singapore is now at the leading edge of development and it'd have to chart its own future...The country must harness the creativity and ingenuity of its people - to a far greater degree than the PAP government has been used to,\" Low told Al Jazeera.\n\nLow said that while he hopes Wong can oversee \"small but much-needed changes\" in Singapore's political culture, it is unlikely he will do much to satisfy Singaporeans' desire for the government to embrace greater diversity and representation - or better tolerate dissent and criticism.\n\n\"Because the party leadership is not emotionally convinced that there is much merit in what the critics or dissenters have to say - a consequence of its elitism and high-handedness - I don't see any significant shifts in the way the PAP conducts politics,\" he said.\n\nChong Ja Ian, a political analyst at the National University of Singapore, said that more Singaporeans are expressing interest in issues beyond monetary and material success - including the environment, meaningful political participation and diversity - which may shape their career plans and how they devote their money, time and energy.\n\nChong said that while the PAP has been trying to soften its image and engage more with younger people, it is \"less clear when and whether such contact and image management have translated into concrete changes in policy\".\n\nChong pointed out that Wong has largely stressed continuity.\n\n\"Whether and how he intends to move in a clearer and bolder direction on these issues - especially how he transforms general principles and ideas into specific and concrete policies - remains to be seen,\" he said.\n\nEugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University, said the Forward SG initiative to rejuvenate the social compact should be seen as an \"attempt to strike the balance between material and post-material concerns\".\n\n\"Going beyond material concerns to balancing that with post-material aspirations - fairness, social justice, egalitarianism, national identity - is not just about putting in place and financing measures that support the policy shifts identified in the Forward SG report,\" Tan told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It is a fundamental mindset shift requiring tangible behavioural changes and committed action that will take years before the outcomes would be evident. The question is will Singaporeans be prepared to wait patiently.\"\n\nTan said that announcements in the 2024 Budget, such as financial incentives for graduates of the Institute of Technical Education, which provides vocational training to post-secondary students, are an important first and necessary step.\n\nStill, Tan acknowledged that shifting the perception that growth is necessary at all costs has been difficult.\n\n\"The vulnerability of Singapore means that material concerns are always writ large but Singaporeans do not want that to be all that is to life in Singapore,\" he said.\n\n\"Forward SG seeks to nudge and mould societal understanding of success and if the PAP under Wong is unable to do that successfully, then its political grip on power will weaken further and faster.\"\n\nWhile Singapore's economic transformation was a vote-winner for Singaporeans born before and shortly after independence, millennials and members of Gen Z who have only ever known prosperity are in many cases itching for change, as demonstrated by the rising vote share for the opposition Workers' Party.\n\nJayee, a student at Nanyang Technological University, said he acknowledged that the PAP has gradually allowed greater space for discourse on issues like LGBTQ rights and income inequality, but wished for more sufficient checks.\n\n\"While the PAP has done wonders for the country, it is often done with a heavy-handed approach...There is a real need for more watchmen in parliament to scrutinise the PAP and question their policies and conduct,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nToby Ang*, a former civil servant in his 30s, said he is more worried about structural issues in the economy, such as stagnating wage growth, that cast a cloud over the city-state's future trajectory.\n\n\"Real leadership and fresh ideas are lacking,\" Ang told Al Jazeera.\n\nAng said he is unconvinced that Singaporeans who aspire to a more egalitarian society are prepared for the necessary trade-offs.\n\n\"The future state of the economy is quite worrisome. I am a bit concerned that we have put ourselves on a slippery slope, that we are moving towards a high-income Scandinavian model. But we are wired very differently in psyche from the Nordics,\" he said.\n\nSMU's Tan said that Singaporeans increasingly expect a government that \"talks with - rather than talks to or, worse, talks down to - the average citizen\".\n\n\"They want Singapore to remain exceptional but also a place that they can call home even as others make the country their hotel and playground,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, they want their views to matter and they want to be courted for their votes.\"\n\nAs for Yeo, the former corporate lawyer, he is determined to make up for the time he lost working himself to the bone.\n\n\"I wonder what life would have been like if I'd lived differently in the past, if I'd set more boundaries and prioritised my well-being instead,\" he said.", "source":

Singapore \"cannot afford\" such a state of affairs, he said, as it does not rely on oil and gas revenues to provide for its citizens, unlike the Middle Eastern country.\n\nDue to this difference, while the UAE allows foreigners to come in freely, the approach is not possible in Singapore, DPM Wong said.\n\nHe was speaking to The Economist in a wide-ranging interview on May 6, ahead of his succession to prime minister on May 15.\n\nDPM Wong noted that the period of effortless growth for Singapore is over as the country is at a high level of development, and labour is just one of its issues.\n\n\"We will be expensive. I mean, you cannot expect high wages and low cost. Wages and cost are two parts of the same coin. We have high incomes, costs are high, we will have to keep on innovating, restructuring and then pushing the productivity and innovation frontier to justify the premium,\" he said.\n\nGiven the challenges ahead, Singapore has to continue attracting cutting edge investments here, pushing the frontier, and be prepared to let non-viable businesses fade away so that resources can be freed up.\n\n\"It is very much the process of churn, which can be very disruptive to workers, but that is why we have also put in place a lot of efforts to help workers retrain, reskill and upskill,\" he added.\n\nWhether Singapore can be a society that can do away with its categorisation of ethnic identities under Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others (CMIO) was another topic delved into, with the interviewer asking if Singapore can truly be post-racial.\n\nDPM Wong said he is indeed eyeing evolving Singapore into a society that becomes \"race blind\" but he also has to be \"very realistic\", given that recent events have continued to send reminders that the instincts of race are primal and emotive, even dormant, among citizens.\n\n\"They just lie below the surface. It only takes an incident, a bad actor, someone trying to stir things, to cause the dormant virus to flare up again. That is why we have to be vigilant and watchful,\" he said.\n\nDPM Wong cited the spike of race-related incidents during the Covid-19 pandemic as one example.\n\nDescribing these incidents as \"very sharp, very antagonistic\", he recalled the racial slurs made towards a person of a certain ethnic community when seen walking around without wearing a face mask in the park, as well as the sharp reaction in response to an influx of arrivals from India.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wong_pei_ting@straitstimes.com", "name": "Wong Pei Ting", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Malaysia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Singapore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demographics of Singapore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malay language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/05/08/20240225106281609img3078.jpg?VersionId=AU97dnpW4562hyiHHGzPPLus.CEk3.he", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552163", "eventUri": "eng-9552163", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1155, "textEnd": 1160}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1207, "textEnd": 1213}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

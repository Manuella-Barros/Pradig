Now, he said, the US is responding to what it has seen in and around the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorisation to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"And that went right to the president, and as you've heard, he's approved [the] use of our weapons for that purpose. Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is as necessary adapt and adjust,\" Blinken said.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is 30 kilometres from the border with Russia.\n\nIt is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine. Earlier this year, he bent to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.\n\nUS officials said on Thursday that US policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 300km, and other long-range US weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\nThe US is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Friday that Ukraine using any Western weapon to strike Russian territory is \"a question of time\".\n\n\"I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time. Otherwise, it is not about just peace,\" Zelensky told reporters on a visit to Stockholm.\n\nUkraine has stressed the urgency for the use of Western-supplied arms to conduct strikes inside Russia as it defends against Russian advances in the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nThis spring, Ukraine found itself on the back foot in the 27-month-old full-scale invasion as it faces delays in military aid from the US, increased attacks on its energy infrastructure and Russia's push to expand the frontline.\n\nZelenskiy said Ukraine \"got [a] message from the American side early in the morning\" which signified a \"step forward\" in defending people in villages near the border with Russia. He did not disclose additional details on the communication with the US.\n\nZelenskiy said he did not yet know the possible restrictions related to the use of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets, but appealed to the question of fairness in deliberations, saying Ukraine should be able to retaliate against Russian strikes.\n\nGermany, another major ally, signalled its openness to Ukraine's use of its weapons to strike military sites fuelling attacks on the Kharkiv region.\n\nFrance has taken a similar stance, saying Ukraine should be allowed to strike military sites Russia is using to attack its territory.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dawn.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts":

Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, Ukrainian officials said, killing at least six people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv by targeting Russian capabilities in the region, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period. But it drew a furious response from Moscow and warnings it could draw Russia into war with NATO.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nBlinken said Kyiv had asked Washington for permission to use U.S.-supplied weapons against the Kremlin's troops amassing on the Russian side of the border for attacks inside Ukraine. Biden's approval was for that purpose, Blinken said at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague.\n\nU.S. officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nIn response, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Friday that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" -- an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. Last week, Russia said military drills involving tactical nuclear weapons had begun.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense.\"\n\n\"Putin wanted to deter the NATO allies from supporting Ukraine. But we are not and we will not be deterred,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nSix people were killed, according to Syniehubov, and at least 25 were wounded.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\n___\n\nLee and Janicek reported from Prague.

Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, Ukrainian officials said, killing at least six people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv by targeting Russian capabilities in the region, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period. But it drew a furious response from Moscow and warnings it could draw Russia into war with NATO.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nBlinken said Kyiv had asked Washington for permission to use U.S.-supplied weapons against the Kremlin's troops amassing on the Russian side of the border for attacks inside Ukraine. Biden's approval was for that purpose, Blinken said at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague.\n\nU.S. officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nIn response, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Friday that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" -- an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. Last week, Russia said military drills involving tactical nuclear weapons had begun.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense.\"\n\n\"Putin wanted to deter the NATO allies from supporting Ukraine. But we are not and we will not be deterred,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nSix people were killed, according to Syniehubov, and at least 25 were wounded.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, Ukrainian officials said, killing at least six people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv by targeting Russian capabilities in the region, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period. But it drew a furious response from Moscow and warnings it could draw Russia into war with NATO.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nBlinken said Kyiv had asked Washington for permission to use U.S.-supplied weapons against the Kremlin's troops amassing on the Russian side of the border for attacks inside Ukraine. Biden's approval was for that purpose, Blinken said at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Prague.\n\nU.S. officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nIn response, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Friday that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" -- an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. Last week, Russia said military drills involving tactical nuclear weapons had begun.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense.\"\n\n\"Putin wanted to deter the NATO allies from supporting Ukraine. But we are not and we will not be deterred,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstr\u00f6m noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nSix people were killed, according to Syniehubov, and at least 25 were wounded.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them.

Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added, without elaborating on what Berlin called confidential agreements with Kyiv.\n\nBiden's decision allows for US-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the US policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defence.\"\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defence minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as nine kilometres (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometres (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This decision, aimed at defending the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, comes as Ukrainian forces face challenges from Russian attacks in the region. The move has drawn strong reactions from Moscow, with warnings of potential NATO involvement in the conflict. Western leaders have been cautious about easing restrictions on weapons due to fears of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin.Germany joined the United States on Friday in authorizing Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying - a significant policy change that comes as depleted Ukrainian troops are losing ground in the war.\n\nUkrainian officials have expressed frustration over restrictions on the use of Western weapons - especially as the border region of Kharkiv has endured a Russian onslaught this month that has stretched Kyiv's outgunned and outmanned forces.\n\nBoth Germany and the U.S. specifically authorized the use of weapons to defend Kharkiv, whose capital city of the same name lies only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Russia. Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment building in the city overnight, Ukrainian officials said, killing at least five people.\n\nBeyond offering Ukraine a chance of better protecting Kharkiv by targeting Russian capabilities in the region, it's not clear what effect the easing of restrictions might have on the direction of the conflict in what is proving to be a critical period. But it drew a furious response from Moscow and warnings it could draw Russia into war with NATO.\n\nThe German government said Ukraine can use weapons it supplies against positions just over the border, from where Russia launches its attacks on Kharkiv. A day earlier, U.S. President Joe Biden gave Kyiv a green light to strike back with American weapons at Russian military assets targeting the region, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\n\nIn response, Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said Friday that \"Ukraine and its NATO allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict\" - an eventuality that Western governments have ruled out.\n\nWestern leaders have hesitated to ease the restrictions on their weapons because of the risk it would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. Last week, Russia said military drills involving tactical nuclear weapons had begun.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of the 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, some Western leaders have pushed for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe Kremlin's bigger and better-equipped army is exploiting Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid. Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nThe German government statement noted that, in recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks on the Kharkiv region, in particular from areas just over the border in Russia.\n\n\"Together we are convinced that Ukraine has the right under international law to defend itself against these attacks,\" the statement said. \"For this, it can also use the weapons delivered for that purpose in accordance with its international legal commitments, including the ones delivered by us,\" it added.\n\nBiden's decision allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" one official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, stressed that the U.S. policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he supported lifting the limits on Ukraine's use of Western weaponry, saying it's \"a matter of upholding international law - Ukraine's right to self-defense.\"\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom noted that his country had not restricted Ukraine's use of its weapons at all, while Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome won't let Kyiv use Italian weapons outside its territory.\n\nIn Moscow, Medvedev repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set NATO and Russia on the path to a nuclear conflict. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he said.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defense minister, Andrei Belousov, claimed Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions,\" including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as 9 kilometers (5 miles). Russian forces captured 28 towns and villages over the past month, he said.\n\nOverall since the start of the year, Russian forces have taken control of 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory, he added.\n\nIt was not possible to verify his battlefield claims.\n\nOvernight into Friday, Russia launched five ballistic missiles at Kharkiv, Ukraine's air force said. One of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nFive people were killed, according to Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov, while the governor said at least 25 were wounded.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles - the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is as necessary adapt and adjust.\"\n\nThe change in language comes after Kyiv officials had applied pressure on the US to allows strikes inside Russia to counter Moscw's advances in the towns just north of Kharkiv.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Stockholm, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine \"got message from the American side early in the morning\" on Friday which signified a \"step forward\" in defending people in villages near the border with Russia.\n\nHe added: \"I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time. Otherwise, it is not about just peace.\"\n\nMr Zelensky did not disclose additional details on the communication with the US and questions hang over what restrictions remain in place in relation to the use of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets. But US officials on Thursday confirmed that US policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles, and other long-range US-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\nNato foreign ministers met in the Czech capital on Friday to re-affirm their support for Ukraine, as countries begin to remove restrictions on western-supplied weaponry to counteract Russian advances inside Ukrainian territory.\n\nGermany signalled its openness to Ukraine's use of its weapons to strike military sites fuelling attacks on the Kharkiv region.\n\nA German government spokesperson said: \"We are jointly convinced that Ukraine has the right, guaranteed under international law, to defend itself against these attacks.\n\n\"To do so, it can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations; including those supplied by us.\"\n\nFrance has also re-positioned its stance, giving Ukraine the green light to strike targets inside Russia in response to attacks on Kharkiv.\n\nEarlier this week, France's President, Emmanuel Macron, raised the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine. French authorities are trying to put together a coalition of willing countries to train Ukrainian forces besieged by the Russian army.\n\nAccording to Le Monde, the mission would initially involve \"a few dozen specialists to identify training needs\".\n\n\"Then, in a second phase, a mission of several hundred soldiers. The idea is to train deminers, or even... to train the soldiers of a new motorised brigade.\"\n\nConsultations are likely to accelerate in the next few days, as Mr Zelensky embarks on a visit France to mark the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 and 7 June.\n\nThe news comes as Russia continues to attack Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.

While many allies have provided Ukraine with longer-range weaponry, it has frequently come with the condition that it only be used on Ukrainian soil.\n\nHowever, recent Russian actions like the indiscriminate and massive shelling of Kharkiv and a renewed offensive in the north of that region are prompting some partners to reconsider those limitations.\n\n\"The time has come for allies to consider whether they should lift some of the restrictions they have put on the use of weapons they have donated to Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said in the interview with the Economist.\n\n\"Especially now when a lot of the fighting is going on in Kharkiv, close to the border, to deny Ukraine the possibility of using these weapons against legitimate military targets on Russian territory makes it very hard for them to defend themselves,\" he added.\n\nThe issue is already being discussed within the European Union and NATO, and based on public statements, a majority of allies now favor removing the restrictions. An increasing number of voices are calling for allowing Ukraine to hit Russian targets with Western arms.\n\nThe UK, Poland, Lithuania, Canada, Latvia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Czechia, France, and Finland believe Ukraine has a legitimate right to strike Russian territory in self-defense.\n\nGermany has also recently inched towards allowing such strikes.\n\nMeanwhile, Belgium and Italy remain opposed to Ukraine using Western arms to strike inside Russia itself.\n\nIn the United States, there is no consensus on whether Ukraine should use American weapons to strike Russia.\n\nThe United States is Ukraine's most influential ally, but until lately, there has been no unified position within the Biden administration on whether Ukraine should be permitted to strike Russia with American weapons.\n\nIn what appears to be a shift of this position, President Joe Biden has reportedly given private permission for Ukraine to use American weapons on Russian soil \"for counter-fire purposes\", meaning \"to hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them.\" However, the permission applies only near Kharkiv, a Ukraine's second-largest city that has been ceaselessly pummeled by Russian cross-border strikes, Politico reported on 30 May.\n\nHowever, the general policy for long-range strikes is still unchanged, unnamed officials familiar with the policy told Politico.\n\nThe issue has been long on the table. A report by Politico from 14 May suggests Ukraine has been pressing the White House to lift the restrictions, prompting active internal debate.\n\n\"The main problem right now is the White House policy to limit our capability\" to strike military targets inside Russia, David Arakhamia, chair of the ruling Servant of the People party in the Ukrainian parliament, said during a visit to Washington this week.\n\nUkraine strikes Russian territory with Western arms, most recently against Krasnodar - AFP\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken initiated the discussion after what he called a \"sobering trip to Kyiv,\" arguing that Ukraine needs to be allowed to hit Russian targets. In Kyiv, he said the US is not encouraging such strikes but that the decision is ultimately up to Ukraine.\n\nSimilarly, House Speaker Mike Johnson stated Ukraine needs to be able to wage war as it sees fit. Besides, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers has also urged the Pentagon to allow the strikes, saying the current Biden policy handcuffs Ukraine's ability to resist Russian forces.\n\nAmong European countries, Belgium and Italy still do not support strikes on Russian territory using Western weapons.\n\nUntil lately, Germany was also among the hesitant, but this is now changing.\n\nOn 26 May, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz still maintained he sees no reason to expand the zone where Ukraine can employ German military aid, saying the established rules agreed with Kyiv are working well.\n\n\"There are clear rules that have been agreed with Ukraine and that apply to the supply of German weapons. At least, that is my position,\" he said, adding that his policy toward Ukraine aims to \"prevent the conflict from escalating into a major war.\"\n\nHowever, on 28 May, Scholz was reported by Politico as saying that German weapons could be used \"within the framework of international law.\" The next day, his spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit clarified to reporters that Ukraine's \"defensive action is not limited to one's own territory, but [can] also be expanded to the territory of the aggressor,\" according to Politico.\n\nA person familiar with the position of the German government claimed, speaking with Politico on condition of anonymity, that Scholz supports allowing the use of Western weapons against targets on Russian territory. However, this source did not provide any further details.\n\nMeanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni dismissed Stoltenberg's position as \"counterproductive.\" \"I don't know why Stoltenberg said that, I think we have to be very careful,\" Meloni stated.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister reiterated that Belgium and Ukraine previously agreed that the use of Belgian military assistance outside Ukrainian territory is out of the question. He said this during a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels.\n\n\"Everything that is stipulated in the agreement, military equipment, military materials, must be used by the Armed Forces on Ukrainian territory, we have signed such an agreement,\" said Alexander De Croo.\n\nFinland informed as early as February that it had placed no restrictions on how its weapons could be used, implicitly green-lighting cross-border strikes. Britain's foreign secretary recently confirmed Ukraine's right to do so, stating that Russia is attacking Ukrainian territory, and it's completely understandable that Ukraine feels the need to defend itself.\n\nPoland supports Ukraine striking targets in Russia since, as Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said, Russia is not constraining itself, attacking Ukrainian power grids, grain terminals, gas storage and civilian infrastructure while stopping short of using nuclear weapons.\n\nLithuania's foreign minister admitted allies erred originally by limiting Ukraine but now need to grant more freedom to strike Russian targets.\n\n\"We made a mistake from the very beginning by restricting the Ukrainians, because it could have been seen as an escalation,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis said.\n\nAccording to him, Ukraine should be able to use the equipment provided to achieve its strategic objectives, including \"strikes on Russian territory, supply lines and troops preparing to attack Ukraine. Only one side is subject to the rules. We must abandon these rules that we have created ourselves.\"\n\nLatvian President Edgars Rinkevics believes the current Russian offensive results from allies' indecisiveness, saying,\n\n\"What we see is the consequence of our inability to provide Ukraine with weapons and also putting restrictions [on using] those weapons to strike military targets in Russia.\"\n\nHe saw no rational reason to preserve the ban for Ukraine and dismissed fears Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons as unfounded.\n\nThe American Institute for the Study of War believes that Western restrictions on using Western weapons to strike targets in Russia have allowed the Russian military to create a safe foothold from which Russian aircraft can launch guided bombs and missiles at Ukrainian positions. Ground troops and equipment can also move freely along the border before engaging in combat.\n\nStriking Russian territory with Western-supplied weapons would allow Ukraine to hit staging areas, logistics hubs, ammo depots, and other strategic military assets inside Russia that are being used to support and enable the Russian offensives into Ukrainian territory. It would also help counter Russia's ability to strike Ukrainian cities and infrastructure from its own territory using aircraft, missiles, and long-range artillery while staying out of range of Ukraine's current weaponry.\n\nAs it stands, the restrictions give Russia an advantage in being able to maneuver and concentrate forces close to the border before attacks. Ukraine would be able to degrade Russia's air defenses inside Russian territory, making it easier for Ukrainian strikes against Russian forces in occupied Ukrainian areas.\n\nCalls for Ukraine to stop defending itself are immoral, Nobel laureate Matviichuk says\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy previously cited two reasons the West hesitates to allow counterstrikes on Russian soil.\n\nAccording to him, the West's primary reason for hesitating - fear of nuclear escalation - was overblown because Putin would refrain from using nuclear weapons out of a sense of self-preservation. In an interview with the New York Times, Zelenskyy also suggested that there was another reason for the West's hesitation: Some countries were seeking to retain trade and diplomatic ties with Russia. \"Everyone keeps the door slightly ajar,\" he said.\n\nAnother divisive issue allies are grappling with is the potential deployment of troops to Ukraine, with nations similarly split on the prospect.", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "orysia_hrudka@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Orysia Hrudka", "type":

After repelling Russia's initial march on Kyiv, Ukraine has asked its Western allies for greater and greater support: first ammunition, then tanks, then cluster munitions, then fighter jets.\n\nEach time, the West has agonized over whether to grant Kyiv's latest request, fearing escalation and a potential Russian response. Each time, the taboo was broken - and nothing happened. What seemed beyond the pale one week had become banal the next.\n\nBut the rhythm of deliberation and delay has been hard to shake. Despite securing more weapons from the United States last month, Ukraine has not been able to use them as it pleases. As Moscow this month launched its surprise assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region, Washington forbade Kyiv from using US weapons to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThis too crumbled. President Joe Biden this week gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons they have given to Kyiv can be used.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\" near Kharkiv city, \"including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday on a visit to Prague, the Czech capital. He confirmed Biden had approved Ukraine's request.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the decision as a \"step forward\" which will help his forces to defend the embattled Kharkiv region.\n\nWhile the decision may mark a new phase of the war, analysts have questioned whether the new freedoms will significantly bolster Ukraine's ability to repel Russia's invasion.\n\nSome are bullish. This month, the calls for the US to remove the restrictions became more desperate, as Russia continue to pummel Kharkiv city with missiles and make gains elsewhere in the region.\n\nFirefighters work at a hardware store targeted by a Russian air strike in Kharkiv, May 25, 2024.\n\nValentyn Ogirenko/Reuters\n\nIn a CNN op-ed, Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges described the bizarre effect of the US taboo: \"We have heard Ukrainian soldiers repeatedly tell stories of Russian columns attacking, being repelled, and retreating to safe Russian territory to regroup, have a hot meal, plan and attack again.\"\n\n\"Ukraine cannot win if Russians can attack civilian targets with impunity and call 'time out' in their own territory,\" they wrote, urging Biden to call his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin's bluff.\n\nBut military analysts have tempered expectations, partly because the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away.\n\nInstead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles).\n\nKateryna Stepanenko, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, told CNN the policy change will \"blunt\" Russia's offensive in Kharkiv, but still \"preserves the majority of Russia's sanctuary space.\"\n\n\"The policy still protects Russia's operational and deep rear sufficiently that this change near Kharkiv Oblast is insufficient to bring about a turning point in the war. Ukraine particularly needs the capacity to strike deep rear areas to defeat the Russian ground and air threats, as many Russian airfields that support strikes against Ukrainian cities are located outside of the allowed GMLRS range,\" she said.\n\nElderly Ukrainians wait to be evacuated from the city of Vovchansk as Russia advances in Kharkiv region, May 20, 2024.\n\nNarciso Contreras/Anadolu/Getty Images\n\nFranz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine \"to hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.\"\n\n\"We need to be realistic about what can be expected from this policy change, since the Russian armed forces have already adapted to the introduction of ground-based precision fires,\" he said.\n\nMathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the policy change would allow Ukraine to \"be more efficient when it comes to repelling attacks and pushing back preemptively.\"\n\n\"It's not a game changer, per se. It's an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself,\" he said.\n\nRed lines fade\n\nThe US is joining the United Kingdom, France, Germany and several others in removing restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons it is given.\n\nBefore Biden gave the green light, Putin had made veiled nuclear threats to countries considering allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with their weapons. He warned the move could lead to \"serious consequences,\" particularly for \"small and densely populated countries.\"\n\nAs well as making nuclear threats, Putin also signaled earlier this month that he was open to peace talks.\n\n\"All of these false narratives deliberately aimed to discourage Western decisionmakers from allowing Ukraine to preempt Russia's attack on Kharkiv city,\" Stepanenko said.\n\nWhile the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has previously experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory it considers its own.\n\nUkraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \"Storm Shadow\" missiles provided by the UK.\n\nUkraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion.\n\nIn both cases, Russia had warned Ukraine and its Western allies not to cross its red line. In both cases, Ukraine and its Western allies ignored the warning.\n\n\"The Kremlin already regards strikes against occupied Crimea and Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts as 'strikes against Russia,' but the reality is that there are few things that Russia can do to further escalate its war in Ukraine without incurring major risks,\" Stepanenko said.\n\nCNN's Alex Marquardt,

Biden has relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine twice this year, earlier this year, he resisted calls to send long-range missiles to Kyiv. U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine using U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia that were attacking the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, after Kyiv sought authorization from Washington in recent weeks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Friday.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Prague after an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers, Blinken did not specifically say whether Biden's authorization could expand to include other Russian cities and targets that are deeper inside Russia.\n\nHe said Washington's move, a marked change in policy by Biden, who had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia, was a result of U.S. strategy of adjusting and adapting to the battleground. Now, he said, the U.S. is responding to what it has seen in and around the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved use of our weapons for that purpose.

Western Europe's inadequate military production has also slowed crucial deliveries of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMr Biden's decision allows for US-supplied weapons to be used for \"counterfire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them\", one Washington official told The Associated Press.\n\nBut the officials stressed that the US policy calling on Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia has not changed.\n\nThe German announcement came hours after Russian ballistic missiles slammed into an apartment block in Kharkiv and killed at least four people.\n\nRussia launched five S-300/S-400 ballistic missiles at Kharkiv overnight, Ukraine's air force said.\n\nOne of them struck a residential building close to midnight and was followed by another missile 25 minutes later that hit first responders, according to regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. At least 25 people were injured, he said.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them.\n\nThe tactic is called a \"double tap\" in military jargon. Russia used the same method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe restrictions until now on the use of Western weapons have frustrated Ukrainian officials as the military has been unable to order hits on Russian troops massing across the border -- Kharkiv city is only 12 miles from Russia -- or Russian bases used to launch missile attacks.\n\nThe question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on February 24 2022.\n\nWestern leaders hesitated to take the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut as Russia has recently gained the battlefield initiative in some parts of 600-mile front line, some Western leaders are pushing for a policy change allowing Kyiv to strike military bases inside Russia with sophisticated long-range weapons provided by its Western partners.\n\nThe German announcement brought a furious response from Moscow, with Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia's Security Council, saying: \"Ukraine and its Nato allies will receive such a devastating response that the alliance won't be able to avoid entering the conflict.\"\n\nHe also repeated Russian warnings that the steps being taken could set Nato and Russia on the path to a nuclear confrontation. \"It's not an attempt to scare or any sort of a nuclear bluff,\" he added.\n\nRussia's newly appointed defence minister Andrei Belousov claimed on Friday that Russian troops are \"advancing in all tactical directions\", including in the Kharkiv region where he said they have pushed Ukrainian forces back by as much as five miles.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

But don't expect that to tilt the war in Ukraine's favor.", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\n\"It is so late,\" Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Programme, told BI. \"It is more than two years after a decision like that should've been taken,\" he said, blaming delays from the US and slow decision-making.\n\nThe ability to strike within Russia would strengthen Ukraine's hand, but it was unclear if it would fundamentally alter the course of the war, Alexander Libman, a professor of Russian and East European politics at the Free University of Berlin, said.\n\n\"The military logic of allowing Ukraine to use weapons against targets in Russia is straightforward,\" he said, but \"there are structural limits, which Ukraine is now facing.\"\n\nUkraine's allies have sent it billions of dollars in military aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, but with the caveat that it wasn't allowed to use the weapons to go after targets on Russian soil.\n\nMany worried that crossing that line would provoke Russian President Vladimir Putin and escalate the conflict. That's meant that Ukraine has had few ways to strike attack aircraft or troop build-ups that threaten it from Russian territory.\n\nBut this calculation seems to have changed with the launch of a border offensive near Kharkiv in Ukraine's northeast.\n\nOn Tuesday, France said Ukraine should be allowed to use Western weapons to hit targets in Russia -- but only sites that Russia is using to launch attacks on Ukraine.\n\nA day earlier, lawmakers from all 32 NATO states adopted a declaration urging alliance members to allow strikes on military targets inside Russia.\n\nAnd the US, which has repeatedly stated it won't allow Ukraine to use weapons it's supplied to strike Russia, appears to be changing its tune.\n\nThree unnamed officials told Politico on Thursday that Ukraine can now use US-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.\n\nOne of the officials said that Ukraine could use US-provided weapons only to hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them in Kharkiv, where Russia has seized more territory and threatens the country's second-largest city.\n\nIn recent weeks, Ukraine has faced renewed Russian offensives, especially in Kharkiv.\n\nOne Ukrainian commander told The Times of London that his unit had Russian troops in their sights for weeks as they gathered across the border, but hadn't been allowed to attack.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, has repeatedly begged the country's partners to let it use Western weapons to target the Russian soldiers across the border.\n\nAccording to Giles, lifting the restrictions would be of \"huge\" assistance to Ukraine in repelling incoming Russian offensives, as well as in targeting Russia's war-making capabilities.\n\n\"This would be a major step forward because Russia would no longer have the sanctuary zones from which it could prepare and launch these attacks,\" he said.\n\nHe also said that Ukraine could launch the same kind of military campaign it has been conducting against Russia's Black Sea Fleet, where Ukraine has successfully held back Russia's far superior navy despite having no real navy of its own.\n\nThis is a \"demonstration of what Ukraine could achieve if it did not have these restrictions for striking into Russian territory itself,\" Giles said.\n\nJohn Hardie, the deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said letting Ukraine use Western-provided tube artillery and rocket systems like the US-supplied HIMARS to hit Russian artillery across the border was a \"no-brainer.\"\n\n\"It's unfair to make Ukraine sit on its hands until after Russian forces cross the border, or to make Ukrainian guns stay silent when Russian artillery is firing from across the border,\" he said.\n\nWestern-provided missiles like Storm Shadow and ATACMS could also go after some Russian air bases that launch aircraft for glide bomb attacks.\n\nHowever, he said that this alone won't be enough to turn the tide in Ukraine's favor.\n\nUkraine could also struggle to develop the intelligence needed to find and quickly strike targets farther inside Russia.\n\nEarlier this month, unnamed Ukrainian officials told The New York Times that they needed more real-time intelligence and information from the US and EU allies about targets in Russia.\n\nIt's far from clear whether the US will reverse its position and offer intel to support these strikes. Without it, Ukraine's targeting will be limited to satellite imagery, drone surveillance, and what its informants can spot on the ground.\n\nThis is not the only pressing issue. Libman, the Free University of Berlin professor, said that if Ukraine's lack of troops and dwindling artillery shells remain unresolved, it will continue to face \"major\" problems on the battlefield.\n\n\"This does not mean that allowing Ukraine to hit targets in Russia will not help -- but it is clearly not a silver bullet to win the war,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

Biden still won't let Ukraine carry out long-range attacks with U.S. weapons inside Russia, the official said.\n\nPolitico first reported the decision earlier Thursday.\n\nThe decision marks a significant shift for Biden, who had earlier resisted calls to use U.S. weapons in retaliatory strikes inside Russian territory. The Biden administration had long viewed that as a potential escalation of the war against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces that could spark attacks on NATO nations.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged the West to send long-range weapons that would allow his forces to strike targets inside Russia. Ukraine has stepped up its attacks on Russian energy infrastructure despite unease from the U.S. and other allies.\n\n\"They would like Ukraine to win in a way that Russia does not lose,\" Zelenskyy told reporters earlier this month. \"Because that would be a loss with unpredictable consequences and unpredictable geopolitics.\"\n\nThat view has gained more backers outside the government as well. On May 19, former U.S. Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland said such targets ought to be \"fair game.\"\n\n\"I think it's time for that because Russia has obviously escalated this war,\" Nuland told ABC News' This Week with George Stephanopoulos. \"It is time to give the Ukrainians more help hitting these bases inside Russia.\"\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_sink@sacbee.com", "name": "Justin Sink", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guerrilla warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Week_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "This Week (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Nuland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria Nuland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/w8aau7/picture288894672/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/d9353c46-604d-4401-8ade-d81098ffd445", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1537, "textEnd": 1543}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports that President Biden has partially lifted the ban on Ukraine using American weapons on Russian territory.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, are increasingly clear that the restrictions put Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia steps up attacks around the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nThe progress came as Russia exploited a long delay in replenishing U.S. military aid and as Western Europe's insufficient military production slowed crucial battlefield deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nDiscussions about a policy shift intensified within the Biden administration more than two weeks ago, after Russia stepped up its offensive around Kharkiv, according to one of the officials close to the White House deliberations .\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and General CQ Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a secure video conference with their Ukrainian counterparts during which the party Ukraine requested authorization to use American weapons to strike Russia. positions across the border that were being used to attack the Kharkiv region, according to a U.S. official close to the White House deliberations.\n\nAfter that May 13 meeting with the Ukrainians, Sullivan, Austin and Brown regrouped and agreed to recommend that Biden change his policies.\n\nSullivan presented the recommendation to Biden two days later, arguing that it made sense that the Ukrainians could retaliate to counter attacks on their land that originated from Russian territory. Biden agreed.\n\nLater on May 15, Biden had a follow-up conversation with Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who leads U.S. European Command, Austin and Sullivan, and asked them to move forward in finalizing the details of the policy change .\n\nMeanwhile, during Secretary of State Antony Blinkens' visit to kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy argued for using U.S. weapons to retaliate against positions in Russia launching attacks in the north and northeastern Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and took that message back to Washington, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the thinking of America's top diplomats.\n\nBlinken met with Biden and Sullivan on May 17, after his visit to kyiv, and shared what he heard from Zelenskyy and made clear that he also supports giving Ukrainians more leeway to retaliate against Russia .\n\nBiden nevertheless remained cautious and requested due diligence before giving final approval.\n\nSullivan summoned the administration's national security officials for a conversation the following week, and they all agreed to move forward. Sullivan received final approval from Biden several days ago, but the guidelines did not take effect until Thursday, the official said.\n\nIt was not an easy decision to make. Since the Russian invasion began in February 2022, Biden has remained strongly opposed to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weapons, fearing that the action could be seen as a provocation and lead Moscow to expand the war .\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that U.S. policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons was constantly evolving, hinting that Washington could modify its unwritten ban on their use by Ukraine for attacks on Russian territory . On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where, during a tour of a Czech military base, he saw armored vehicles being sent to kyiv.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials insist there is no formal ban on the weapons, they have long made clear that they believe using U.S. weapons to attack targets in Russia could provoke an escalation of Moscow's response , which Russian President Vladimir Putin promised.\n\nThis position, Blinken noted, was a hallmark of the Biden administration's position on the need for Ukraine to adapt and adjust as necessary.\n\nAs conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia is doing has changed in terms of its continued aggression and escalation, we have adapted and adjusted as well, and I I am confident that we will continue to do so, Blinken said at a press conference. conference in Moldova.\n\nWe are always listening, always learning and always making decisions about what is necessary to ensure that Ukraine can and continues to defend itself effectively, he said.\n\nCalls for policy change are growing.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Western countries should not object if Ukraine were to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed this position on Thursday.\n\nI think the time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to allow Ukrainians to really defend themselves, he said. We need to remember what this is all about. This is a war of aggression launched voluntarily by Moscow against Ukraine.\n\nThe right to self-defense, he added, also includes striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky told a NATO-related event in Prague on Thursday that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless onslaught.\n\nUkraine cannot fight Russia with its hands tied behind its back, he said. Ukraine must be able to fight against the barbarian invasion of Russia, even on Russian territory. Political determination must be backed by credible capabilities.\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine has a clear right under international law to attack Russia inside the Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\n\nBiden's decision comes as he prepares to travel to France early next month to attend commemorations of the 80th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelensky is one of dozens of world leaders expected at the D-Day commemorations.\n\n___\n\nLee reported from Prague.

The move follows the U.S.'s policy shift allowing Ukraine to use American weapons for self-defense, which many NATO allies support despite Russian threats.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg on Friday dismissed warnings by Russian President Vladimir Putin that allowing Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike inside Russian territory might lead to an escalation. Speaking on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Prague, Stoltenberg said the alliance had heard such warnings many times before and self-defence was not escalation.\n\n\"This is nothing new. It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters. \"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised once again the risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv. In a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine using U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia that were attacking the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed in Prague.\n\nHe said Washington's move was a result of a U.S. strategy of adjusting and adapting to the battleground, indicating that Moscow's attacks on Kharkiv have necessitated this. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE Russian fighter jets flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing high-precision glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the border and the front line near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back. \"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law. In Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical limits on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine. Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters. His comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski, who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ... Ukraine has the right to defend itself according to the rules of humanitarian law.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

The White House's ambiguity cost the lives of civilian Ukrainians.\n\nIn this regard, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on the US President to overcome his long-standing fears of a possible nuclear \"escalation\" with Moscow. He said this in an interview with The Guardian.\n\nOn Thursday night, it emerged that after months of lobbying, the US took a small but symbolic step - and for the first time allowed some US-made weapons to be used by the Kyiv military to fire into Russian territory while defending Kharkiv.\n\nBut in his interview, Zelenskyy made it clear that he needed to be able to use \"powerful\" long-range weapons that could hit targets deep inside Russia - a red line that the White House refused to lift.\n\nThe United States, he said, needs to \"have more faith in us.\"\n\nWithout this green light, Zelenskyy said, other allies, such as the United Kingdom, may also not allow Ukraine to use its long-range weapons.\n\n\"Believe us, we have to respond. They understand nothing but force. We are not the first and not the last target. I think it's absolutely illogical to have [Western] weapons and see murderers, terrorists, killing us from the Russian side. I think sometimes they just laugh at this situation. It's like a hunt for them. A hunt for people. They realize that we see them, but we can't get to them,\" he said.\n\nIt is worth noting that US President Joe Biden, under pressure from his advisers and key allies, allowed Ukraine to conduct limited strikes inside Russia using US-made weapons. This change in White House policy could be a new chapter in the war for Ukraine. American officials expect that the first attacks on Russian territory could begin within hours or days.\n\nThe German government has also authorized Ukraine to attack targets in Russia with German weapons. However, this applies only to the Russian territory bordering the Kharkiv region of our country.\n\nAs OBOZ.UA wrote, on May 30, the American newspaper Politico reported that Biden secretly authorized Ukraine to strike at Russia with American weapons, but the permission applies only to the defense of Kharkiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian Armed Forces can open fire on Russian forces that attack or intend to attack the Kharkiv region, the Biden administration confirmed.\n\nAt the same time, The Washington Post reported earlier, citing sources, that the United States does not mind Ukraine shooting down planes and missiles over Russian territory with air defense systems provided by Washington. The authorization is valid if these targets \"pose a threat to Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/5/31/6000.jpg?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 2167, "textEnd": 2173}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised once again the risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine using U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia that were attacking the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed in Prague.\n\nHe said Washington's move was a result of a U.S. strategy of adjusting and adapting to the battleground, indicating that Moscow's attacks on Kharkiv have necessitated this.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE\n\nRussian fighter jets flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing high-precision glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the border and the front line near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\nIn Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical limits on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine.\n\nLithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters.\n\nHis comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski, who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ...

Its position had been the centre of attention since it supplied Ukraine with large quantities of weapons, capable of hitting targets in Russia.\n\nUkraine is now allowed to use German weapons against Russian targets in line with international law, a national government spokesperson said in a statement released to the press.\n\nIt followed very closely the US, whose weapons can now also be used from the city of Kharkiv against Russian targets, several media reported on Thursday (30 May) in the evening.\n\nBetween five to ten countries, including the United Kingdom, Finland, France, Poland, Lithuania, and the Netherlands gave their backing over time since the beginning of the war more than two years ago.\n\nPressure mounted on Kyiv's backers over the past few days, with Russia opening a new front of its illegal war, north of Kharkiv, putting additional strains on the stretched, ammunition-deprived Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nThe situation was clouded by uncertainty, as to whether the armed forces were allowed to use Western-delivered weapons to target armament stockpiles and other military targets in Russian territory.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said earlier this week that Ukraine was not currently \"using our partners' arms to attack Russian territory\" so as not to risk their support - a situation he considered \"unfair\", asking allies to \"please give us the permission to do that.\"\n\nStoltenberg called on members to lift restrictions on weapon use so Ukraine could strike deep into Russia, in an Economist interview last week.\n\nThough NATO as an organistion does not supply weapons to Kyiv, there are discussions that it should take over the lead from Washington.\n\nGermany's move is another shift in its national defence policy, caused by what Chancellor Olaf Scholz called a Zeitenwende - a change of times - with Berlin agreeing to supply weapons to a country at war.\n\n\"In recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated, and carried out attacks from positions in the Kharkiv area in particular from the directly neighbouring Russian border region. Ukraine can also use the weapons supplied for this [self-defence] purpose [against these attacks] in accordance with its international legal obligations, including those supplied by us,\" said the German government explaining its decision.\n\n\"The point is that Ukraine must have the ability to defend themselves: if the target has moved itself into Russia, then [Ukraine] should move as well,\" said Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis.\n\nHowever Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavsky, on Thursday (31 May), before hosting the informal NATO ministerial meeting, said it was up to each government to decide themselves which restrictions to apply to Ukraine's use of their delivered weapon.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"},

Self-propelled howitzers, for example, can engage targets at a distance of up to 56 km (35 miles), but are not deployed in the immediate vicinity of the front.\n\nFrance, Britain and the United States have supplied Ukraine with weapons with greater target ranges. The city of Kharkiv is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nBerlin's statement came a day after U.S. officials suggested President Joe Biden had quietly shifted policy to allow Kyiv to fire U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting the Kharkiv offensive.\n\nPreviously Biden had steadfastly refused to let Ukraine use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Prague on Friday also spoke in favour of Ukraine using weapons provided by Western countries to strike legitimate military targets inside Russian territory.\n\nA Kremlin spokesperson said on Friday that it was already aware of attempts by Ukraine to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons provided by the United States, which is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\n(Reporting by Friederike Heine, Matthias Williams, Sarah Marsh, additional reporting by Holger Hansen, Editing by Rachel More, Gareth Jones, Kirsti Knolle,

They will also be able to hit Russian military units that are just over the border in Russia's Belgorod Oblast.\n\nThe US officials insisted Ukraine would not be able to use US-provided missiles for attacks on civilian infrastructure or for long-range attacks on military targets that are deep inside Russia.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" a US official told POLITICO. The official insisted the US still would not support long-range strikes on Russian territory.\n\nUkraine needs support from the US for targeting when it fires US-provided missiles, which means the US will now be directly supporting strikes inside Russia. The escalation risks provoking a major response from Russia, as Moscow recently warned the UK that it would target British military sites in Ukraine and \"beyond\" if British missiles were used in strikes on Russian territory. Over the past year, both US and British missiles have been used to target Crimea.\n\nThe news comes a day after Secretary of State Antony Blinken hinted that the US was preparing to change the policy, saying the US will \"adapt and adjust\" when asked if Urkaine could strike Russian territory with US weapons.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that the restrictions on Ukraine's use of US weapons were put in place as part of President Biden's plans to \"avoid World War III.\" But throughout the war, the US and other NATO countries have taken escalations they previously ruled out due to fear of provoking Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has warned that any NATO countries that let Ukraine strike Russia with their weapons would face \"major consequences.\"", "source": {"uri": "defenddemocracy.press", "dataType": "news", "title": "defenddemocracy.press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgorod_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "http://www.defenddemocracy.press/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/joe-biden-speech-5-11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Self-propelled howitzers, for example, can engage targets at a distance of up to 56 km (35 miles), but are not deployed in the immediate vicinity of the front.\n\nFrance, Britain and the United States have supplied Ukraine with weapons with greater target ranges. The city of Kharkiv is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nBerlin's statement came a day after U.S. officials suggested President Joe Biden had quietly shifted policy to allow Kyiv to fire U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting the Kharkiv offensive.\n\nPreviously Biden had steadfastly refused to let Ukraine use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Prague on Friday also spoke in favor of Ukraine using weapons provided by Western countries to strike legitimate military targets inside Russian territory.\n\nA Kremlin spokesperson said on Friday that it was already aware of attempts by Ukraine to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons provided by the United States, which is by far the largest arms donor to Kyiv.\n\n(Reporting by Friederike Heine, Matthias Williams, Sarah Marsh, additional reporting by Holger Hansen, Editing by Rachel More, Gareth Jones, Kirsti Knolle,

The administration had previously been concerned that offensive use of U.S. weaponry would provoke Moscow into widening the war.\n\nIn the last few days, the U.S. made the decision to allow Ukraine \"flexibility\" to defend itself from attacks on the border near Kharkiv, the second U.S. official said.\n\nIn effect, Ukraine can now use American-provided weapons, such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or Russian bombers launching bombs toward Ukrainian territory. But the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIt's a stunning shift the administration initially said would escalate the war by more directly involving the U.S. in the fight. But worsening conditions for Ukraine on the battlefield -- namely Russia's advances and improved position in Kharkiv -- led the president to change his mind.

Now, he said, the US is responding to what it has seen in and around the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorisation to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine,\" Mr Blinken said.\n\n\"And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved use of our weapons for that purpose. Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is as necessary adapt and adjust,\" Mr Blinken said.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 30km from the border with Russia.\n\nIt is the second time in 2024 that Mr Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine. Earlier this year, he bent to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.\n\nThe US is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nUS officials said on May 30 that US policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 300km, and other long-range US-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.

We're defending Ukraine and it is not the same,\" he said.\n\nThe change in Washington's thinking was attributed by US officials to Russia's daily pounding of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city.\n\nIn the latest Russian strikes on the city overnight, six people were killed and 25 wounded, including two children, officials said.\n\nYulia, a local resident who fled to a basement in the night for shelter, said there were several explosions in the night.\n\n\"We are all just shocked by what we experienced. Honestly, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"These are monsters, these are not people. People cannot do such a thing in the 21st century,\" she said.\n\nRegional governor Oleg Synegubov said the rubble was still being cleared.\n\n\"There may be more people under it,\" he said.\n\nZelensky has pressed Western allies for more support.\n\n\"Only together we can stop the madness from Moscow,\" he said at a press conference in Stockholm.\n\nWhile expressing gratitude to Western allies for weapons supplies, he said there were often delays in deliveries.\n\n\"It can take six months or more from the moment the package is approved to the moment it is used.... Our biggest enemy is slow supply,\" he said.\n\nUkraine has intensified strikes on Russian targets in recent months, claiming drone attacks on military and energy infrastructure targets deep inside the country.\n\nRussia's military said on Friday it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe increasing intensity of strikes has come as Russian troops have made gradual advances in Ukraine this year after holding off a Ukrainian counter-offensive last year.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov said Moscow's forces had seized 880 square kilometers (340 square miles) of territory so far in 2024.\n\n\"The advance is underway in all tactical directions,\" he said at a meeting of the Russian-led

But nothing has happened since then: no Storm Shadow missiles have flown over the Ukraine-Russia border. Last night, Volodymyr Zelensky explained why: the UK had not given '100 per cent permission' to do so. 'We raised this issue twice. We did not get confirmation from him [Cameron].' In reality, Downing Street is waiting on the Americans, he said.\n\nThe calls for the US and other allies to allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with western arms have grown louder after Russia launched a second offensive in the Kharkiv region. They came from senior diplomats and the masses on Twitter, where Ukrainians launched the #LetUkraineStrikeBack campaign. At least 12 western countries have given Ukraine permission to strike. But the biggest boon for Ukraine came last night, when Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go ahead to strike Russia with some American weapons - albeit with restrictions.\n\nThe Biden administration has said that Ukraine may only strike Russian targets near the Kharkiv region. This means that Kyiv will be able to use US-provided short-range weapons to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or at aircraft launching bombs toward the region. This marks a groundbreaking shift in US international politics, and is already prompting other allies to lift their bans as well.\n\nThose in Zelensky's inner circle describe his relationship with Biden as 'very, very tense', especially after the Ukrainian President criticised his US counterpart for his decision to attend a Democratic fundraiser instead of Ukraine's peace summit in mid-June. 'The peace summit needs Biden, as well as other leaders who look at the US response. His absence... [Vladimir] Putin will applaud this, standing,' said Zelensky this week. Zelensky, who is often blunt and was once labelled ungrateful by former defence secretary Ben Wallace, has a point: Ukraine is fighting Russia under countless restrictions while Moscow is unhindered.\n\nFor Kyiv, permission to strike Russian military and air force bases, artillery guns, and multiple rocket launchers stationed along the border could significantly alter the course of the war. Ukrainian troops won't have to wait for Russian missiles to cross the border - they'll be able to shoot down the aircraft carrying them. The arrival of F-16 fighter jets will make this job easier. Denmark and the Netherlands have already allowed Ukraine to use their F-16s to strike military targets in Russia (but Belgium has banned the use of its F-16s for such strikes when they arrive in the autumn). Even Germany is shifting its stance from a strict 'no German weapons on Russian soil' stance to a position where, according to Olaf Scholz's spokesman, 'defensive action is not limited to one's own territory, but can also be expanded to the territory of the aggressor'.\n\nThe best-case scenario for Ukraine would be receiving permission to use long-range western weapons to strike Russian military bases deep into the country. But even now Ukrainians are feeling a huge sense of relief, seeing that the West has stopped constantly worrying about the Kremlin's reaction. The only serious threat so far has been Russia's move to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus - a psychological ploy, since Putin could launch a nuclear strike from Russian territory if he wanted to.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and current deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, is the only one in the Kremlin who delights in posting nuclear threats on his Telegram channel every week. This time, he warned that Putin will respond by carving out a buffer zone to protect Russia from attacks - something Russian forces are already attempting in the Kharkiv region. Medvedev claims that if British Storm Shadow or French SCALP-EG missiles, with a range of 350 miles, can reach Belgorod from Kyiv, the 'sanitary zone' must encompass the whole of Ukraine. 'In other words, there must be Russia everywhere,' Medvedev said, adding, 'And in Poland itself.'\n\nMore than two years of war in Ukraine have proved that appeasement does not stop Putin: it encourages him. Allies should strike a compromise with Kyiv, allowing Ukraine to target military sites in Russia's border regions such as Belgorod, Kursk, and Rostov, at the very least. These regions are staging grounds for Russian offensive actions and missile attacks on Ukraine. Kyiv won't target Russian schools, hospitals and kindergartens - only Moscow does that.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

White House officials insisted, however, that the authorization extended only to what they characterized as acts of self-defense, so that Ukraine could protect Kharkiv, its second-largest city, and the surrounding areas from missiles, glide bombs and artillery shells from just over the border.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official said in a statement issued by the administration. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the statement continued, referring to an artillery system, provided to Ukraine, that has the capability to reach deep inside Russian territory.\n\nThe decision by Biden was reported earlier Thursday by Politico.\n\nAmerican officials said that the change in policy went into effect Thursday.\n\nThough the White House cast the decision as a narrow one, allowing the Ukrainians to strike preemptively if they see evidence of preparations for an attack, or in response to a Russian barrage near Kharkiv, the implications are clearly much broader. Until now, Biden has flatly refused to let Ukraine use American-made weapons outside of Ukrainian borders, no matter what the provocation, saying that any attack on Russian territory risked violating his mandate to \"avoid World War III.\"\n\nBut having reversed his position, even in limited circumstances, Biden has clearly crossed a red line that he himself drew. And administration officials conceded that if Russia mounted other attacks from inside its territory beyond Kharkiv, the president's restrictions could be subject to further loosening. \"This is a new reality,\" one senior official said, declining to speak on the record, \"and perhaps a new era\" in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nMuch may depend on how the Russians react to the change in the next days and weeks -- or whether they react at all. Russia has warned that it will respond, in unspecified ways, if the United States shifts policy. Last week, as word of an impending change took place, Russia conducted drills for the forces that move and deploy tactical nuclear weapons, in what appeared to be a signal to the U.S.\n\nRussia has repeatedly played the nuclear card in the 27 months since it invaded Ukraine, mostly notably in October 2022, when it appeared the entire Russian military invasion of Ukraine could collapse. Gen. Mark A. Milley, then the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, often talked about the \"nuclear paradox,\" that the closer the Russians came to losing in Ukraine, the higher the nuclear peril.\n\nBut now Biden's reversal raises a new question: How will Russia react to strikes that employ American weapons inside its territory? It is impossible to know exactly where Russian President Vladimir Putin will draw his red line. Putin has not responded to Britain's decision to ease the restrictions on its weapons, but in the Russian leader's mind, the United States is a different kind of rival.\n\nInside the White House, Biden's deliberations were closely held, known only to a very narrow group of aides. But The New York Times revealed last week that Secretary of State Antony Blinken had come back from a sobering trip to Kyiv and privately told the president that his 27-month-long ban against shooting American weapons into Russian territory was now placing parts of Ukraine in peril. The Russians, he said, were exploiting the president's ban and mounting constant attacks from a safe haven just inside the Russian border.\n\nBut by that time, Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had already concluded that the geography of the battle around Kharkiv would require an exception to the hard rule that the United States had set against firing into Russia, senior officials said. Ukraine was suffering from what one official called \"an artificial line\" in the middle of the battlefield that kept them from responding to devastating attacks. Sullivan and Austin concluded that it made no sense to restrict the Ukrainians from responding -- even while maintaining a ban on using U.S. equipment for long-range strikes deep into Russia.\n\nSome U.S. allies had already gone further. Britain weeks ago allowed Ukraine to use its Storm Shadow long-range missile systems for attacks anywhere in Russia, and France and Germany recently took the same position. So did Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO.\n\nFrom the outside, it appeared that each of those countries was mounting a campaign to get Biden to change his mind. But American officials insisted that only Britain reached its decision before Washington did and that by the time the major European allies supported the change, they had been told Biden was headed in the same direction.\n\nThe decision follows weeks of intense behind-the-scenes conversation with the Ukrainians, made more urgent after Russia began a major assault on Kharkiv around May 10.\n\nThree days later, May 13, Sullivan, Austin and the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., held one of their regularly scheduled secure video conferences with their Ukrainian counterparts. Once again, the Ukrainians pressed for Biden to lift U.S. restrictions on firing into Russian territory, arguing that the president's concerns about escalation were overblown. But now, they said, the issue had become more urgent because the Russians were shelling civilian sites around Kharkiv from inside their border -- knowing that the Ukrainians could not fully respond.\n\nAfter the meeting, officials said, Sullivan, Austin and Brown decided to recommend to the president that he reverse his position. But they kept the decision very close. Two days later, May 15, Sullivan conveyed the recommendation to Biden, who -- for the first time -- said he was inclined to carve out an exception that would allow the Ukrainians to strike back, even if Russian attacks were coming from just a few miles behind the Russian border. By then, Blinken was already in Kyiv and had heard the case for a reversal directly from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe same day as the private meeting with Sullivan, the president saw Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli, the four-star commander of the U.S. European Command and the supreme allied commander for Europe. He was in Washington for an annual meeting of all the combatant commanders and told Biden that he also agreed that the ban on firing into Russia was posing a danger to Ukraine -- though he, too, one official said, was concerned about the possible Russian reactions.\n\nBlinken returned from Kyiv and saw Biden and Sullivan on the evening of May 17 in the Oval Office, saying that he emerged convinced that the United States had to alter its stance. It was clear by then that Biden was in agreement, officials said, but the president insisted that before he issued a formal decision, he wanted a meeting of his national security \"principals\" to consider the risks. That meeting did not take place until last week, just as news of Blinken's change of view leaked out.\n\nWhite House officials were clearly angry about the leak, and some said they were worried it would tip off the Russians or interfere with the final decision-making. The formal orders did not get conveyed to the Pentagon until earlier this week. Blinken, who knew the change was coming, hinted at the possibility in Moldova, where he left open the possibility that the United States might \"adapt and adjust\" its stance because the situation on the ground had changed. But he did not say that the president had already reversed course, and White House officials refused to comment.\n\nBiden has never publicly commented on the internal debate that led him to change his approach. So it is unclear whether he now believes that the risk of escalation -- including nuclear escalation -- has declined or whether the prospect that Ukraine might lose more territory changed his view.\n\nSo few members of the National Security Council or the Pentagon knew of the change that a Pentagon spokesperson, Sabrina Singh, was still defending the old policy Thursday afternoon in a briefing for reporters. She repeatedly said that there was no change. \"The security assistance that we provide Ukraine is to be used within Ukraine, and we don't encourage attacks or enable attacks inside of Russia,\" she said.\n\nBut she insisted that Ukraine could be effective by focusing on tactical and operational targets that directly influence the conflict within its boundaries, she said. \"So our policy hasn't changed.\"\n\nIn fact, it had, days before. No one had told her, defense officials say, that Austin had already released orders to allow Ukraine to open fire, with American weapons, on military targets over the Russian border.\n\nU.S. officials now say they expect that the first counterattacks with American weapons will begin within hours or days.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint Chiefs of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Milley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Milley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Q._Brown_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Q.

That decision marked a reversal of U.S. policy, and it appears the German government has now followed suit.\n\n\"In recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks from positions in the Kharkiv area, in particular from the directly adjacent Russian border region,\" German government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said Friday.\n\nUkraine \"has the right, guaranteed under international law, to defend itself against these attacks,\" he added. \"To do so, it can use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations, including those supplied by us.\"\n\nIn recent days Chancellor Olaf Scholz had underscored Ukraine's right to defend itself by striking targets inside Russia in accordance with international law, but had remained vague on whether Berlin had given Ukraine permission to use German-provided weapons to do so.\n\nScholz has so far refused to send Ukraine its long-range Taurus cruise missiles, which could be used to strike deep into Russian territory, arguing it could bring Germany into direct confrontation with Russia. But Germany has provided other weapons systems that could potentially be used to strike targets inside Russia near the city of Kharkiv, including self-propelled howitzers and Mars II rocket launchers.\n\nIn recent weeks, leaders of NATO countries have debated whether to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike military targets inside Russia. Ukrainian leaders have argued that restrictions on how they can use such arms have allowed the Russians to attack Ukraine from Russian territory with little threat of retaliation.\n\nWhile the recent decision from Washington marks a reversal of policy, the Biden administration still refuses to allow Ukraine to use U.S. cruise missiles to strike deep into Russian territory, fearing such attacks could escalate the war.\n\nToday's German announcement follows a familiar pattern, in which Berlin waits for Washington to move first on military aid to Ukraine before following in lockstep. Last year's decision to provide battle tanks to Kyiv followed the same dynamic.\n\nGerman politicians across the political spectrum praised today's announcement.

Now What?", "body": "Earlier this week, a Russian early warning radar installation was hit by unidentified projectiles; Ukrainian drones, Ukraine's military intelligence agency claimed.\n\nIt was unclear if there was any significant damage, but of more significance was where the facility was located: around 1,800 kilometers from the Ukrainian border.\n\nThroughout the 27 months since Russia launched its all-out invasion, Ukraine has been attacking sites inside Russia: first quietly and sporadically, then boldly and loudly, including cross-border raids by loosely affiliated paramilitary groups and spectacular drone strikes in the heart of Moscow.\n\nBut Ukraine has chafed at the restrictions that have kept it from utilizing its Western-supplied arsenal to make more substantive attacks further inside Russia: on troop staging grounds, or railways, or weapons depots, for example. A 3-week-old offensive near Kharkiv in the northeast that has stretched Ukraine's forces thin has added to the impatience.\n\nAs of May 30, that's changed, as the United States joined more than a dozen NATO allies and signaled for the first time it would give Ukraine permission to strike some targets inside Russia itself.\n\nThe shift is limited in scope, allowing Ukrainian forces to use short-range missiles from HIMARS launchers, or artillery, to hit command-and-control posts, arms depots, and other military targets used as part of the Kharkiv offensive. Ukraine will still be barred from using longer-range surface-to-surface missiles known as ATACMS against targets inside Russia.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden \"recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official told RFE/RL. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long-range strikes inside of Russia has not changed.\"\n\nThe change was first reported by Politico.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right to strike targets in Russia,\" Jack Watling, senior researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London, said during a Financial Times podcast prior to the announcement. \"It is at war with Russia, and Russia is striking targets in Ukraine every day.\"\n\nBut he said the question is what kinds of weapons Ukraine would be allowed to use to make a substantial difference. Howitzers fired across the border are one thing; longer-range Storm Shadow or Scalp cruise missiles or ATACMS missiles are another.\n\n\"I think if we just draw a hard line and say, 'Strikes in Russia? No.' That's very unhelpful,\" he said. \"But we do also need to appreciate that there are different kinds of strikes using different kinds of systems that hold quite different risks.\"\n\nIn the past, Russia has warned that Washington supplying longer-range weaponry to Ukraine \"would cross a red line.\" But even as Western weapon supplies have grown in frequency and number, Russia has refrained from targeting shipments or depots where they could be located.\n\nAsked about the reported change in U.S. policy, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov claimed that Moscow knew nothing about it and suggested that the Russian government did not see it as a significant change in the status quo.\n\n\"It's well known that on the whole American weapons have already been used to try and target Russian territory,\" he said on May 31. \"That is enough for us to know and is very eloquent evidence of the level of involvement of the United States in this conflict.\"\n\nUkraine for months has enthusiastically gone after targets in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia seized in 2014. Russia has a substantial deployment of troops, aircraft, and equipment there, not to mention its Black Sea Fleet naval ships, which until recently have been based in the port of Sevastopol.\n\nIn late April, Ukraine used ATACMS, or Army Tactical Missile System, to hit an airfield in Dzhankoy in Crimea. Though Ukraine had received shorter-range versions of the ATACMS in the past, the Dzhankoy attack was the first time Ukraine had used the longer-range model -- something that the United States had secretly supplied months prior.\n\nUkraine has also used the British-French-designed Storm Shadow missiles to target Russian naval facilities in Crimea.\n\nSince the United States, like most of the international community, does not recognize Russia's claim to Crimea, there were few, if any, restrictions on Ukraine targeting sites in Crimea.\n\nUkrainian forces have been struggling on the battlefield for months now, a situation caused in part by the pause in U.S. weapons supplies that resulted from political infighting in Washington.\n\nOn May 10, their struggles deepened further when tens of thousands of Russian troops crossed the border north of the city of Kharkiv, opening up a new offensive and forcing Ukrainian commanders to rush more experienced units to the region from other hot spots.\n\nThe policy change \"will allow for Ukraine to target Russian troops, especially high-value targets such as command-and-control elements, artillery, logistics, and air-defense units that are located on Russian territory near Kharkiv and concentrating or rehearsing future operations against Ukraine,\" Mick Ryan, a retired Australian Army major general, said in an e-mail newsletter. \"This is the kind of operational strike -- the ability to destroy Russian military forces before they are committed to combat operations -- that is essential while Ukraine reconstitutes its forces in 2024.\"\n\nOne of the reasons Russia is making gains at present is its dominance of the air. Russia has been able to use jet-dropped glide bombs to devastating effect, said Johan Norberg, a senior analyst and expert on Russia's military at the Swedish Defense Research Agency FOI.\n\nUkraine has been unable to push back due to a lack of robust air defenses such as U.S.-made Patriot systems.\n\nWith Western weaponry and the ability to strike Russian airfields, Ukraine should be able to curtail Russia's ability to attack effectively with planes, Norberg said.\n\n\"They have to move farther away, also making things more difficult in terms of the frequency of sorties you can make over Ukraine,\" he told RFE/RL. \"And then the military rationale is clear. There could be other arguments I could find, like striking on command posts...deeper inside Russia or various logistics hubs.... But I think right now, air power seems to be some of the Ukraine's biggest problems at the moment.\"\n\nIt's unclear exactly what prompted the Biden administration to change its policy. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who traveled to Kyiv last month, reportedly received a sober assessment of the ability of Ukraine's forces to hold out. In Congress, lawmakers from both parties had criticized the White House for holding Ukraine back.\n\nSpeaking to Blinken at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 22, the committee's Republican chairman, Michael McCaul, accused the Biden administration, and White House national-security adviser Jake Sullivan more specifically, of creating a \"sanctuary\" for Russian forces across the border.\n\nGermany, which has been one of the most hesitant NATO members where Western weaponry is concerned, on May 31 signaled it was in agreement with the new U.S. policy. Ukraine has repeatedly asked Berlin for its Taurus KEPD-350 cruise missile.\n\nOver the past two weeks, a growing chorus of NATO members have come out in support of using various Western weaponry more aggressively, to hit targets inside Russia itself.\n\n\"However, with regard to weapons that can operate over a long distance, of hundreds of kilometers, there is still a reluctance on our part,\" German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told reporters during a visit to Moldova.\n\n\"Looking at where we are today, where we...supply missiles, armored vehicles, what have you -- they would have been out of the question two years ago. But everything is done very gradually,\" Norberg said. \"Whether this was deliberate to, sort of, slowly boil the frog, and not pass any Russian red lines, or just because of decision-making taking a long time at the West, I don't know.\"\n\nComplicating the discussion: Ukraine's willingness to go after Russian targets - civilian or military - on its own, with its own technology, in all likelihood without U.S. and NATO approval. The attack on the Voronezh-M radar installation near the city of Orsk on May 27 was the latest example.\n\nThat drew criticism from some arms control experts who say it's potentially dangerous for Ukraine to target military objects used for nuclear deterrence - not something directly related to the Ukraine conflict.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nBiden's decision was first reported by Politico.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around the northeast Kharkiv region.\n\nThe advances came with Russia exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of US military aid and as Western Europe's inadequate military production has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nTalks about changing the policy intensified inside the Biden administration more than two weeks ago, after Russia stepped up its offensive around Kharkiv, according to one of the officials familiar with the White House deliberations.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a secure video conference with their Ukrainian counterparts in which the Ukrainian side pressed for permission to use US weaponry to hit Russian positions across the border that were being used to attack the Kharkiv region, according to a US official familiar with the White House deliberation.\n\nFollowing that May 13 meeting with the Ukrainians, Sullivan, Austin and Brown huddled and agree to make a recommendation to Biden to alter the policy.\n\nSullivan presented the recommendation to Biden two days later, making the case that it was common-sense for the Ukrainians to be able to strike back to counter the attacks on their land that were originating from Russian territory. Biden agreed.\n\nLater on May 15, Biden had a follow-up conversation with Gen. Christopher Cavoli, who leads US European command, Austin and Sullivan and asked them to move forward on finalizing the details to the change in policy.\n\nMeanwhile, during Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv two weeks ago, Zelenskyy made his case for using American weapons to strike back at positions in Russia that were launching attacks into north and northeast Ukraine.\n\nBlinken was convinced and brought that message back to Washington, according to three US officials familiar with the top US diplomat's thinking.\n\nBlinken met with Biden and Sullivan on May 17, following his visit to Kyiv, and shared what he heard from Zelenskyy and made clear that he also supported giving the Ukrainians more leeway to strike back on Russia.\n\nStill, Biden remained cautious and asked for due diligence before giving final approval.\n\nSullivan convened the administration's national security leaders for a conversation the following week, and they all agreed to move forward. Sullivan received final approval from Biden several days ago, but the guidance did not go into effect until Thursday, the official said.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision to make. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022, Biden has been steadfast in his opposition to Ukraine's offensive use of American-made weaponry, concerned that the action could be seen as provocative and lead to Moscow widening the war.\n\nBlinken said in Moldova on Wednesday that US policy on how Ukraine deploys American weapons is constantly evolving, hinting that Washington may alter its unwritten prohibition on Ukraine's use of them for attacks on Russian territory. On Thursday, Blinken joined NATO foreign ministers for a meeting in Prague, where during a tour of a Czech military base he saw armored vehicles that are being sent to Kyiv.\n\nAlthough US officials insist there is no formal arms ban, they have long made clear that they believe the use of American weapons to attack targets inside Russia could provoke an escalatory response from Moscow, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised.\n\nThat position, Blinken noted, was a \"hallmark\" of the Biden administration's stance on Ukraine to \"adapt and adjust\" as needed.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted, too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken said at a news conference in Moldova.\n\n\"We're always listening, we're always learning, and we're always making determinations about what's necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself, and we'll continue to do that,\" he said.\n\nCalls for a change in policy have been mounting.\n\nEarlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said that Western countries should not object if Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia to defend itself. Stoltenberg reaffirmed that position on Thursday.\n\n\"I believe that time has come to (re)consider some of these restrictions to enable the Ukrainians to really defend themselves,\" he said. \"We need to remember what it is. This is a war of aggression launched by choice by Moscow against Ukraine.\"\n\nThe right to self-defense, he said, \" includes also striking legitimate military targets outside Ukraine.\"\n\nCzech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said at a NATO-related event Thursday in Prague that Ukraine needs resources to counter Russia's relentless assault.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot fight against Russia with one hand tied behind its back,\" he said. \"Ukraine must be able to fight against Russia's barbaric invasion even on Russian territory. Political resolve must be backed by credible capabilities.\"\n\nNorway's foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told Norwegian broadcaster NRK that his country believes Ukraine \"has a crystal-clear right under international law to attack Russia inside Russia as part of the defense of its territory.\"\n\nBiden's decision comes as he's set to travel to France early next month to attend D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy, a watershed moment in changing the course of World War II. Zelenskyy is among dozens of world leaders expected to attend the D-Day commemorations.

So for better co-ordination, for better compliance and for ensuring predictability I strongly believe that Nato should play a bigger role in coordinating support.\n\n\"And we will find ways to ensure that these decisions will work and not be blocked.\"\n\nHe said allies should also commit to a \"multiyear\" financial pledge for Ukraine, providing around 40 billion worth of military support each year.\n\n\"We need a firm commitment for the long haul to ensure Ukraine is able to plan,\" he said.\n\n\"To ensure that Ukraine has the predictability they need to conduct this war of self-defence, but also to send a message to Moscow that Moscow cannot wait us out.\n\n\"The more clear it is to Russia that Ukraine's Nato allies are prepared for the long haul, the sooner the war can end,\" he said.\n\nForeign ministers also discussed Ukraine's path to Nato membership, added Mr Stoltenberg.\n\n\"Allies agree that Ukraine's future is in Nato. And we are determined to make progress in sorting this path,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope that at the summit in Washington we can take further steps and I also believe strongly that the fact that we will most likely establish a mission providing a stronger structure for providing support to Ukraine, that will also help to move Ukraine closer to membership.\"\n\nNo final decisions were taken on the issues, but significant progress was made, he said.\n\nOn Russia's claims of escalation following the US and Germany's green light to use permission to use their weapons inside Russia to counter advances in the Kharkiv region, he said: \"Russia started this war\".\n\n\"The annexed Crimea in 2014 and in 2022, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War Two,\" added Mr Stoltenberg.\n\n\"Russia is striking hospitals, schools and shopping malls. Russia is bombing power and water infrastructure. Russia is killing Ukrainian civilians.\n\n\"Ukraine is defending itself from appalling Russian brutality,\" he said.\n\n\"So let me be clear. Self defence is not escalation. Self defence is a fundamental right enshrined in the UN charter.\"\n\nRussia is the one escalating the war by opening a new front, he added.\n\nMr Stoltenberg was speaking after US President Joe Biden quietly gave Ukraine approval on Thursday to use American-made weapons inside a limited area of Russia.\n\nUkraine's outgunned forces are struggling to hold back Moscow's offensive in the Kharkiv region near the border, with the Kremlin launching attacks from its own territory.\n\n\"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region, so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a State Department representative told The National on Thursday.\n\nGermany followed suit on Friday, saying Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against Kharkiv, in accordance with international law.\n\nUntil now, Ukraine has been prohibited from using western-supplied weapons provided by some countries to attack Russia, and Ukrainians have long argued that Moscow enjoys a great advantage when it attacks the Kharkiv region, which borders Russia, because it can amass troops and launch deadly attacks from within in its own territory.\n\nThe ability to strike supply lines feeding the Kharkiv offensive further inside Russia will help Ukraine degrade Russian capabilities in the region.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday hailed the United States' decision to allow Kyiv to use American-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"This is a step forward towards (the) goal ... of making it possible to defend our people who live in the villages on the border,\" he told reporters in Stockholm where he took part in a Ukraine-Northern Europe security summit.\n\nOn Friday, Russia and Ukraine exchanged prisoners of war in a swap mediated by the UAE.\n\nIt was the fourth major prisoner exchange of the year so far.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Outgunned and outmanned on the battlefield, Kyiv has been increasing pressure on its Western allies to be able to launch offensive strikes at military targets inside Russia to better repel Russian advances.\n\n\"I think that using any weapon, Western kind of weapon, on the territory of Russia is a question of time. Otherwise, it is not about just peace,\" Zelenskiy told reporters on a visit to Stockholm. Ukraine has stressed the urgency for the use of Western-supplied arms to conduct strikes inside Russia as it defends against Russian advances in the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nThis spring, Ukraine has found itself on the back foot in the 27-month-old full-scale invasion as it faces delays in military aid from the U.S., increased attacks on its energy infrastructure and Russia's push to expand the frontline. U.S. President Joe Biden has quietly authorized Kyiv to strike military targets inside Russia which support the offensive in the Kharkiv region.\n\nZelenskiy said Ukraine \"got message from the American side early in the morning\" on Friday which signified a \"step forward\" in defending people in villages near the border with Russia. He did not disclose additional details on the communication with the U.S. Zelenskiy said he did not yet know the possible restrictions related to the use of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets but appealed to the question of fairness in deliberations, saying Ukraine should be able to retaliate against Russian strikes.\n\nGermany, another major ally, signalled its openness to Ukraine's use of its weapons to strike military sites fueling attacks on Kharkiv region.

What we know", "body": "Facing growing pressure from Ukraine and its NATO allies, the U.S. on Thursday partially U-turned on its red line for strikes by Kyiv on Russian soil using Western-supplied weapons.\n\nPresident Joe Biden granted Ukraine permission to use some American-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, but with major caveats. Kyiv may only use the weapons in Russian territory bordering northeast Ukraine for the purpose of defending its Kharkiv region, and the use of long-range missiles such as ATACMS is prohibited on Russian soil, U.S. officials familiar with the matter told media outlets, including Newsweek.\n\nThere had been a growing chorus of calls for Ukraine to be authorized to use donated weapons to attack targets inside Russia, more than two years into the war launched by Moscow in February 2022.\n\nMany NATO nations, including France, Poland, and the U.K., recently came out to say that they didn't have any objections regarding the use of the equipment they provided to Kyiv in the ongoing war, but the U.S. had remained steadfast in its policy that its weapons must only be used on Ukrainian territory.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. supplied-weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" a U.S. official told Newsweek.\n\nThe official was referring to an offensive kick-started by Moscow on May 10, which resulted in Russian forces seizing a number of villages on Ukraine's northeastern frontier as Kyiv suffered a shortage of ammunition and personnel.\n\n\"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS or long range strikes inside of Russia has not changed,\" the U.S. official added.\n\nThe softening of Washington's stance will \"significantly boost\" Ukraine's ability to push back against Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky's press secretary Sergiy Nykyforov told reporters on Friday.\n\nUkraine has received \"positive signals from diplomatic channels about the limited use of U.S.-supplied weapons\" in Russian territory bordering northeast Ukraine, Nykyforov said.\n\n\"It will significantly boost our ability to counter Russian attempts to mass across the border,\" he added.\n\nJohn Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center said Thursday he believes the White House changed course on Ukrainian attacks inside Russia \"in its now well-known overly cautious way.\"\n\nThis includes ruling out Kyiv using the 300-kilometer range ATACMS that Washington first sent to Ukraine in March. It's unclear whether Ukraine will be allowed to use its 150-kilometer range ATACMS, Herbst added.\n\nWashington's new policy \"does the minimum to help Ukraine with a difficult situation in the northeast,\" the former ambassador said.\n\n\"This half step is certainly better than none,\" he said, but added that he believes it \"does not send the necessary message of American resolve to the Kremlin.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier this week that NATO countries, \"especially the ones based in Europe, particularly in small European countries, should be fully aware of what is at stake\" by permitting Ukraine to strike Russian territory with Western weapons.\n\n\"They should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into the Russian territory,\" he said. \"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences.\"\n\n\"It is another step toward a serious conflict in Europe, toward a global conflict,\" the Russian leader added.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Now, he said, the U.S. is responding to what it has seen in and around the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved use of our weapons for that purpose. Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is as necessary adapt and adjust,\" Blinken said.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nIt is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine. Earlier this year, he bent to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.\n\nThe U.S. is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nU.S officials said on Thursday that U.S. policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Prague; Additional reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Doina Chiacu in Washington)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War of aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/HERF,_EMP,_Tempest", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/HERF, EMP, Tempest", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/03a0185/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fd8%2Fb3e162bd8cd0af8d274bddff2e2090%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK4U0LI%3A12024-05-31T134152Z_1_LYNXMPEK4U0LI_RTROPTP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-NATO.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It allows Ukraine's use of counter-fire capabilities against targets across the border that Russia is using to attack the Kharkiv region from, according to a source familiar with the decision.\n\n\"The President recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official stated, noting that the policy against the use of ATACMS, or long-range strikes, inside Russia is unchanged.\n\nEurope\n\nAP via Scripps News\n\n2:55 PM, Mar 12, 2024\n\nPentagon to give Ukraine $300 million in weapons\n\nInternational allies have called for reconsideration of restrictions as Ukraine has faced Russian attacks against Kharkiv.\n\n\"We need to consider those national restrictions especially in the light of the nature of the fighting now taking place in the Kharkiv region where the Russians can be protected by the national border which is more or less the same as the front line,\" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said earlier this week, while noting it was a decision for individual allies to make.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken first publicly indicated a potential policy shift, pointing to the adaptability in U.S. support Wednesday.\n\n\"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression, escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too, and I'm confident we'll continue to do that,\" Blinken told reporters.\n\nBut the start of considerations dates back nearly three weeks to when Russia launched its renewed offensive across the border toward the Kharkiv region in early May.\n\nWorld\n\nAP via Scripps News\n\n3:32 PM, May 24, 2024\n\nRussia smashes train tracks in a battered Ukrainian border region where children are being evacuated\n\nNational Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown agreed to make a recommendation to Biden after meeting virtually with the Ukrainians just three days after the start of the new offensive, in which the Ukrainians made a request to use U.S.-supplied weapons against locations across the border aiding the offensive, according to a source familiar with the decision.\n\nPresident Biden agreed when the recommendation was made to him two days later that Ukraine be able to use the weapons to defend against Russia's offensive, according to a source familiar.\n\nThe president carried out follow-up conversations, and asked his team to finalize details and to continue to go over the proposal, but was clear that Ukraine should be able to counterstrike. Blinken also backed the proposal after returning from Kyiv.\n\nLast week, President Biden gave the green light to the policy after the officials met once more. The administration remained quiet about the decision due to operational security, according to an official who suggested the timeline was more compressed than the time it typically takes for a policy like this.\n\nOfficials had previously maintained that they do not encourage the use of U.S. weapons to strike within Russia, though Austin said in response to a question posed by Scripps News last week that \"the aerial dynamic's a little bit different.\"\n\nEurope\n\nAP via Scripps News\n\n11:03 AM, May 07, 2024\n\nUkraine says it foiled Russian plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nThe U.S. does not restrict Ukraine's use of U.S.-supplied weapons against Russian aircraft posing an imminent threat to Ukraine, according to a U.S. official, which includes Russian airspace. Officials have noted Ukraine's previous successful operations with Western weapons against Russian aircraft.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration continues to face criticism for the pace of decisions in aid for Ukraine.\n\n\"This is a step forward, but perhaps it's better described as a half-step forward. It's part of the continuing pattern of administration caution,\" John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said, pointing to the limits on the use of longer-range weapons.\n\n\"The administration announces all the restrictions that remain and that does not smack of bold policy and that limits the impact of what Ukraine can do,\" he said.\n\nHerbst doesn't rule out further changes, but believes the comments from allies may have influenced the administration's decision.\n\nThe administration has maintained that its efforts to rush assistance are working.

The decision was first reported by POLITICO.\n\nBlinken emphasized that the U.S. posture has evolved as the conflict and Ukraine's needs have changed throughout the now more than two-year-old war. He did not say whether the Biden administration will allow Ukraine to strike inside other parts of Russia but made clear that the U.S. will continue to adapt its positions as the war develops.\n\n\"Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is, as necessary, adapt and adjust,\" he said. \"And that, as I said, has been a hallmark of our engagement.\"\n\nThe move marks a notable shift for the White House, which has long said it does not \"encourage\" or \"enable\" attacks by Ukraine on Russian soil using U.S.-provided weapons.\n\nThe U.S. and Western leaders have been cautious about sparking a wider war and Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened that direct involvement from the West could lead to nuclear conflict.\n\nBut with Ukraine recently struggling on the battlefield, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Western partners to allow Kyiv to use the weapons they provide to strike inside Russia. In recent days, a number of those partners have come out and said they support Ukraine's ability to do so.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP_Blinken_053024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Now, he said, the U.S. is responding to what it has seen in and around the Kharkiv region.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved use of our weapons for that purpose. Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is as necessary adapt and adjust,\" Blinken said.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nIt is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine. Earlier this year, he bent to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv.\n\nThe U.S. is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nU.S officials said on Thursday that U.S. policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Prague; Additional reporting by Daphne Psaledakis and Doina Chiacu in Washington)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War of aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/HERF,_EMP,_Tempest", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/HERF, EMP, Tempest", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_reuters_29/4aaf6d6bc8526f69c782ab23a9ece216", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The ministers' unanimous support followed US President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russian targets. The alliance is set to reaffirm its commitment at the upcoming summit in Washington.\n\nNATO foreign ministers were meeting in the Czech capital Friday to prepare for this summer's leaders' summit as the alliance boosts support for Ukraine and countries one-by-one remove restrictions on how Kyiv can use western-supplied weaponry to combat Russia's invasion.\n\nA day after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use American munitions to strike inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, numerous ministers, including those from the Netherlands, Finland, Poland and Germany, expressed approval of the decision, saying that Ukraine has the absolute right to defend itself from attacks originating on Russian soil.\n\nThe chorus of allied voices backing greater leeway for Ukraine to use their weapons grew louder in recent weeks after Russia launched artillery strikes on Kharkiv from its territory, prompting appeals for help from Kyiv. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted strongly this week that a change in Washington's position was coming.\n\n\"This is a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defence,\" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. \"Russia has attacked Ukraine, (which) has the right to defend themselves. And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\" \"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine's soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops,\" he said. \"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\" Ukrainian officials had stepped up calls on the US administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of US military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nThe alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support. Stoltenberg said he expects to be able to announce at the summit that at least two-thirds of members are meeting their commitment to spend 2 per cent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nPutin on Tuesday warned NATO members against allowing Ukraine to fire their weapons into Russia and raised once again the risk of nuclear war after several allies lifted restrictions imposed on the use of weapons donated to Kyiv.\n\nIn a marked policy shift, U.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine using U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia that were attacking the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed in Prague.\n\nHe said Washington's move was a result of a U.S. strategy of adjusting and adapting to the battleground, indicating that Moscow's attacks on Kharkiv have necessitated this.\n\nKharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nKHARKIV OFFENSIVE\n\nRussian fighter jets flying inside Russia out of reach of Ukrainian air defences have been supporting the offensive by loosing high-precision glide bombs at Ukrainian defence lines and into Kharkiv, where they have caused numerous civilian casualties.\n\nStoltenberg said Ukraine had the right to strike legitimate military targets inside Russia, especially since the border and the front line near Kharkiv were more or less the same, and it was not reasonable to assume Kyiv should not hit back.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right for self-defence, we have the right to help Ukraine uphold the right for self-defence, and that does not make NATO allies a party to the conflict,\" he added. \"That was the case back in February 2022, that was the case last year, that remains the case.\"\n\nIn Berlin on Friday, a German government spokesman said Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Berlin to defend itself against attacks launched from just inside Russia against the Kharkiv border region, in accordance with international law.\n\nIn Prague, Dutch Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot stressed Ukraine's right to self-defence without imposing geographical limits on the use of weapons.\n\nBut other allies such as Italy refuse to go this far, with its foreign minister arguing that his country was banned by the constitution from allowing Kyiv to use donated weapons outside Ukraine.\n\nLithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on these allies to change their stance since \"the time is coming when it will be determined whether we as an alliance are serious ... about assisting Ukraine to win this war\".\n\n\"I have always been of an opinion that Ukrainians are absolutely capable of defining the targets. I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters.\n\nHis comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski, who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ... Ukraine has the right to defend itself according to the rules of humanitarian law.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sabine Siebold, Humeyra Pamuk, Jan Lopatka and Jason Hovet in Prague, Alan Charlish in Warsaw and

All the people were granted anonymity to discuss internal decisions that haven't been announced. ...\n\nIn effect, Ukraine can now use American-provided weapons, such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or Russian bombers launching bombs toward Ukrainian territory. But the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIt's a stunning shift the administration initially said would escalate the war by more directly involving the U.S. in the fight. But worsening conditions for Ukraine on the battlefield -- namely Russia's advances and improved position in Kharkiv -- led the president to change his mind. ...\n\nWhat this means is that if Volodmyr Zelensky (whose legal term of office as Ukraine's President ended on May 20) decides that Ukraine should use American weapons and bombs to hit \"military targets\" that are in Russia and \"near the area of Kharkiv,\" then the U.S. Government will not object. The article does not say how the phrase \"military targets\" there is being defined, nor how \"near the area of Kharkiv\" is being defined.\n\nThe U.S. Government has been, to a large extent if not fully, operating or in control over the operation of those U.S.-made weapons; and, therefore, one may reasonably presume that any decision as to whether to use those weapons and bombs in any given instance will have the prior approval of both the Ukrainian and the American Governments.\n\nOne also may reasonably assume that if ever Ukraine would violate Biden's order in this regard, then Biden would condemn Ukraine for having done so. Whether or not Russia's Government would take that as being sincerely an expression that only Ukraine was to blame for that U.S.-and-Ukraine attack against Russia is impossible reasonably to predict in advance. Consequently, if the limitations upon what Ukraine's government can do with America's weapons and bombs are not yet already over the limits of what will precipitate a nuclear attack by Russia against the United States and its colonies ('allies'), as having \"crossed over Russia's red lines\" of what Russia considers to constitute an acceptable violation of Russia's national security, then how Russia will respond in any case if Ukraine will violate Biden's command and Biden will condemn Ukraine for that, is likewise impossible reasonably to predict in advance. However, if Russia will in such an instance unleash its estimated 5,580 nuclear weapons against the U.S. and its colonies, then there will be a debate among the immediate survivors of WW3 regarding whether the villain here was Biden or instead Putin, or both.\n\nIf WW3 will happen before America's November 5 elections, then if such elections will be held, either Donald Trump or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be the President starting in 2025. If WW3 will happen after such elections, then America's voters today should know that on May 28, the Washington Post, headlined \"Trump makes sweeping promises to donors on audacious fundraising tour\", and reported that at one fundraising event for billionaires and centi-millionaires (not for mere voters), \"he suggested that he would have bombed Moscow and Beijing if Russia invaded Ukraine or China invaded Taiwan.\" In other words: to him, regarding the current war in Ukraine, and regarding the long-sought-by-the-U.S.-Government war in Taiwan, those two wars and to-become wars, are not merely \"other people's wars,\" but these are our wars -- meaning those American billionaires' and centi-millionaires' wars -- to which he, as the U.S. President, would respond immediately by bombing, respectively, Russia and China.\n\nThough the CIA-edited and written Wikipedia (which blacklists [blocks from linking to] sites that aren't CIA-approved) says nothing about the former President of Ukraine Volodmyr Zelenskyy being no longer legally after 20 May 2024 Ukraine's President, and he did announce that the 20 May 2024 elections would be cancelled, he still does serve as-if he is Ukraine's President, and is not questioned about that in U.S.-and-allied media. No polling has been done regarding whom Ukrainians would vote for if they were allowed to vote. However, on 15 February 2024, Yahoo News headlined \"New poll shows Zelenskyy's approval dips 5 points in Ukraine after departure of General Zaluzhnyi\" and buried in its news-report that the poll showed that as-of February 24, the level of \"trust\" in leading political figures by the Ukrainian public were: Valerii Zaluzhnyi - 94%; Kyrylo Budanov - 66%; Volodymyr Zelenskyy - 64%; Serhiy Prytula - 61%; and Oleksandr Syrskyi - 40%. Zaluzhnyi was appointed Ukraine's Ambassador to UK on 7 March 2024, after having been fired by Zelenskyy as Ukraine's top General. Zelenskyy replaced him with Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\nIn any case, Ukraine has been ruled by America's President ever since February 2014, and Russians have long known that this is so.", "source": {"uri": "dissidentvoice.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dissident Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrylo_Budanov", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrylo Budanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerii_Zaluzhnyi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valerii Zaluzhnyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Syrskyi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oleksandr Syrskyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

hit targets inside Russia.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range US weapons to attack Russian territory -- something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag NATO into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nThis appears to have changed since Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nA Russian missile strike in Kharkiv city killed three people and wounded at least 16 others, regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said in a post on Telegram early Friday morning, noting an emergency medic was among the wounded and an ambulance was damaged.\n\n\"The enemy again used a double strike tactic, while medics, rescuers and law enforcement officers were already working on the spot,\" Synegubov said.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have

targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the Kharkiv region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them or preparing to attack them,\" a US official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second US official confirmed the change of policy.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted on Wednesday that Biden could change course.\n\nBlinken, who visited Ukraine earlier this month, said the United States had \"adapted and adjusted\" as the \"battlefield has changed\" in remarks to reporters in Moldova on the eve of NATO talks in Prague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhead of the NATO meeting, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg had also said repeatedly that it was time for members to reconsider the limits on strikes inside Russia.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appeared to shift the dial forward on Tuesday when he said Ukraine should be allowed to \"neutralize\" bases in Russia used to launch strikes.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, however, remained less sure, saying Ukraine should act within the law -- and Berlin had not supplied weapons that could hit Russia anyway.\n\nGerman did, however, promise Ukraine a new package of military aid worth 500 million euros ($540 million) on Thursday, with the defense ministry saying it included \"artillery, air defense (and) drones.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, accused the West on Thursday of

We're defending Ukraine and it is not the same,\" he said.\n\n- 'Stop the madness' -\n\nThe change in Washington's thinking was attributed by US officials to Russia's daily pounding of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second biggest city.\n\nIn the latest Russian strikes on the city overnight, six people were killed and 25 wounded, including two children, officials said.\n\nYulia, a local resident who fled to a basement in the night for shelter, said there were several explosions in the night.\n\n\"We are all just shocked by what we experienced. Honestly, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,\" she told AFP.\n\n\"These are monsters, these are not people. People cannot do such a thing in the 21st century,\" she said.\n\nRegional governor Oleg Synegubov said the rubble was still being cleared.\n\n\"There may be more people under it,\" he said.\n\nZelensky has pressed Western allies for more support.\n\n\"Only together we can stop the madness from Moscow,\" he said at a press conference in Stockholm.\n\nWhile expressing gratitude to Western allies for weapons supplies, he said there were often delays in deliveries.\n\n\"It can take six months or more from the moment the package is approved to the moment it is used.... Our biggest enemy is slow supply,\" he said.\n\n- 'The advance is underway' -\n\nUkraine has intensified strikes on Russian targets in recent months, claiming drone attacks on military and energy infrastructure targets deep inside the country.\n\nRussia's military said on Friday it had shot down 29 Ukrainian drones overnight that were targeting the port city of Novorossiisk and an oil depot in Temryuk.\n\nThe increasing intensity of strikes has come as Russian troops have made gradual advances in Ukraine this year after holding off a Ukrainian counter-offensive last year.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said Moscow's forces had seized 880 square kilometres (340 square miles) of territory so far in 2024.\n\n\"The advance is underway in all tactical directions,\" he said at a meeting of the Russian-led CSTO security alliance in Almaty, according to Russian news agencies.\n\nbur-dt/rlp\n\nMore from this section\n\nChurch of Scientology Debuts New Online Hub for Global Public Service Campaigns\n\nFliFlik Free Giveaway Event!

But Germany has provided other weapons systems that could potentially be used to strike targets inside Russia near the city of Kharkiv, including self-propelled howitzers and Mars II rocket launchers.\n\nIn recent weeks leaders of NATO countries have debated whether to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike military targets inside Russia. Ukrainian leaders have argued that restrictions on how they can use such arms have allowed the Russians to attack Ukraine from Russian territory with little threat of retaliation.\n\nWhile this week's decision from Washington marks a reversal of policy, the Biden administration still refuses to allow Ukraine to use U.S. cruise missiles to strike deep into Russian territory, fearing such attacks could escalate the war.\n\nToday's German announcement follows a familiar pattern, in which Berlin waits for Washington to move first on military aid to Ukraine before following in lockstep. Last year's decision to provide battle tanks to Kyiv followed the same dynamic.\n\nGerman politicians across the political spectrum praised today's announcement.

This decision follows requests from Kyiv and aims to adapt to the current battleground situation. The policy shift reflects Washington's evolving strategy in response to ongoing aggression around Kharkiv.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden approved Ukraine using U.S. weapons to strike targets inside Russia that were attacking the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, after Kyiv sought authorization from Washington in recent weeks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed on Friday. Speaking at a news conference in Prague after an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers, Blinken did not specifically say whether Biden's authorization could expand to include other Russian cities and targets that are deeper inside Russia.\n\nHe said Washington's move, a marked change in policy by Biden, who had steadfastly refused to allow Ukraine to use American weaponry for strikes inside Russia, was a result of U.S. strategy of adjusting and adapting to the battleground. Now, he said, the U.S. is responding to what it has seen in and around the Kharkiv region. \"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved use of our weapons for that purpose. Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is as necessary adapt and adjust,\" Blinken said. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, is 19 miles (30 km) from the border with Russia.\n\nIt is the second time this year that Biden has quietly relaxed his policy on weapons supplies for Ukraine. Earlier this year, he bent to calls to send long-range missiles known as ATACMS to Kyiv. The U.S. is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine in its battle against the full-scale invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2022.\n\nU.S officials said on Thursday that U.S. policy would continue to prohibit the Ukrainian military from using ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range U.S.-supplied weapons for deep strikes inside Russia.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War of aggression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/HERF,_EMP,_Tempest", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/HERF, EMP, Tempest", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_05_2024_09_52_50_9661367.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

I have full confidence that they know and understand what is needed, where the threat comes from,\" Landsbergis told reporters.\n\nHis comments were echoed by his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski, who stressed that Warsaw had never imposed such restrictions.\n\n\"We wish Ukraine victory, we wish them the recovery of all the occupied territories ...

He did not disclose additional details on the communication with the U.S.\n\nZelenskiy said he did not yet know the possible restrictions related to the use of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets but appealed to the question of fairness in deliberations, saying Ukraine should be able to retaliate against Russian strikes.\n\nGermany, another major ally, signalled its openness to Ukraine's use of its weapons to strike military sites fueling attacks on Kharkiv region.\n\nFrance has taken a similar stance, saying Ukraine should be allowed to strike military sites Russia is using to attack its territory.\n\n(Reporting by Anastasiia Malenko; Editing by Nick Macfie)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Ultra-hawk Victoria Nuland, who left the State Department in March, appeared on ABC News this week to make the pitch for Ukraine to extend its use of US weapons to Russian territory.\n\n\"I think there's also a question of whether we, the United States and our allies, ought to give them more help in hitting Russian bases, which heretofore we have not been willing to do,\" Nuland said.\n\n\"I think if the attacks are coming directly from over the line in Russia, that those bases ought to be fair game, whether they are where missiles are being launched from or where they are where troops are being supplied from,\" she added.\n\nMoscow recently warned the UK that if Ukraine used British weapons on Russian territory, Russian forces would target UK military sites in Ukraine \"and beyond.\" The warning came after British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine had the \"right\" to use British arms in attacks on Russia.\n\nRussia is currently conducting tactical nuclear drills that it launched in response to provocative rhetoric from Western officials about sending troops to Ukraine.

Asked whether that includes Russian airplanes this official said, \"We've never told them they can't shoot down a Russian airplane over Russian soil that's coming to attack them.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians asked the U.S. for permission to strike Russia with U.S.-provided weapons earlier this month, on May 13. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General C.Q. Brown told reporters of the Ukrainian request shortly after it was made. Among Biden advisers, the decision to sign off on this was unanimous, according to a senior U.S. official, but Mr. Biden did not give his official approval until Thursday, even though the U.K., France and Germany had publicly given the green light for their own weapons to be used in this way.\n\nThe Biden administration narrowly tailored the U.S. permission to the Belgorod region of the Russian Federation and restricted the use of the weapons to hitting artillery sites and other weaponry aimed at them around Kharkiv. The Ukrainians are still not permitted to use U.S.-provided long-range equipment such as the ATACMs to hit Russia beyond that point, in order to avoid the perception of a direct U.S. escalation with Russia.\n\nIt was not immediately known whether any U.S. weapons have been used under the new guidelines so far. \"That's up to [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy to decide and announce,\" another U.S. official said.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Moldova on Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken previewed the shift in the U.S. stance, saying, \"At every step along the way, we've adapted and adjusted as necessary. And so that's exactly what we'll do going forward.\"\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S.-supplied weapons for counter-fire purposes in the Kharkiv region, so Ukraine can hit back against Russian forces that are attacking them -- or preparing to attack them,\" a U.S. official said. \"Our policy with respect to prohibiting the use of ATACMS -- or long range strikes inside of Russia -- has not changed.\"\n\nA U.S. official confirmed that the U.S. and Ukraine are close to concluding a 10-year bilateral security agreement that would guarantee that the U.S. will build up Ukraine's defense industrial base to provide artillery, ammunition, air defense systems and other weapons. The U.S. would also coordinate with Ukraine on how to push back Russia if it is attacked. The Financial Times was first to report this development. The deal was originally promised by President Biden at last year's G7 summit of world leaders and is expected to be consummated at the upcoming June summit in Puglia, Italy.", "source": {"uri":

They can't continue to do both,\" he said on a visit to Berlin.\n\nUkrainian drones have reportedly struck another Russian radar system, this time in Crimea.\n\nIf confirmed, the attack on the $100-million Nebo-SVU radar reported by Ukraine Pravda would be the latest by Ukraine on Russian radar systems.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine hit a radar station near the border with Kazakhstan, a Ukrainian intelligence official said.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky has said he doesn't miss Boris Johnson because the former prime minister is always with him.\n\nThe Ukrainian president described Mr Johnson as a \"good friend\" who \"really helped Ukraine\".\n\nThe pair struck up a close bond in the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion and spoke almost every day.\n\nSince standing down as prime minister, Mr Johnson has made numerous trips to Kyiv and joined international efforts to prepare Ukraine for Nato membership.\n\nAsked if he missed Mr Johnson in an interview with the Guardian, Mr Zelensky said: \"He does not give me the opportunity to miss him. He is always here.\"\n\nRussian strikes killed three people in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, authorities said on Friday.\n\nWith Russia having retaken the battlefield initiative in recent months, Ukraine had doubled down on calls to permit it to use longer-range US weapons to attack Russian territory - something Washington had resisted over fears it could drag Nato into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nBut that calculus changed after Russian forces launched a fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region this month.\n\nViktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, claimed on Friday that there was a plot to carry out an EU conscription drive amid fears of a war with Russia.\n\nIt would mean that someone else could decide about the blood of Hungarians,\" he told the Good Morning, Hungary radio show.\n\n\"Such thoughts should be quickly dismissed; the seed must be removed from the soil before it can sprout.\"\n\nThe Hungarian leader - who is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe - blamed the plan on Manfred Weber, a German conservative MEP, who is president of the centre-right EPP group.\n\nBut Mr Orban's accusations are seen as absolutely baseless and part of his wider row with Nato over the alliance's support for Ukraine.\n\nGermany has told Ukraine it can use M270 rocket launchers donated by Berlin to strike Russian soil, the Telegraph understands.\n\nThe M270 - which has also been donated by Britain - is a tracked version of the American-supplied Himars system.\n\nGerman officials have also told counterparts in Kyiv that German-made self-propelled 155mm artillery howitzers can be used on cross-border strikes on military targets inside Russia.\n\nIt came after an agreement during talks with the Quad group of Britain, America, France and Germany, sources said.\n\nSteffen Hebestreit, the German chancellor's spokesman, said: \"Ukrainians are fighting for their country and their freedom. Many countries around the world are supporting them politically, economically and with military equipment and weapons.\n\nUkraine has handed over to Russia the bodies of 45 Russian servicemen as part of a swap, the RBS news outlet cited lawmaker Shamsail Saraliyev as saying.\n\nGermany suggested Ukraine could use weapons supplied by Western countries to defend itself against attacks on Kharkiv launched from just inside Russia\n\n\"We are jointly convinced that Ukraine has the right, guaranteed under international law, to defend itself against these attacks,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"To do so, it can also use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations; including those supplied by us.\"\n\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's comments on Western arms supplied to Ukraine show they have been used against targets on Russian soil all along, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday.\n\nZakharova was commenting on Stoltenberg's remarks about there being no restrictions on Kyiv's use of British Storm Shadow cruise missiles and some other weapons supplied by Nato countries.\n\nAn oil depot in the Krasnodar region was on fire and people were injured after Ukraine's air strike early on Friday targeting oil facilities, the governor of the southern Russian region said.\n\n\"The situation is more serious in the Temryuk region - the infrastructure of the oil depot there was damaged by an air strike: three tanks with petroleum products are damaged and burning,\" Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\n\"The fire is being extinguished now... Unfortunately, there are injured among the employees of the oil depot.\"\n\nRussian missiles hit three sites in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, killing at least three people and injuring 16, local officials said early on Friday.\n\nAccounts of the attack said the missiles hit a five-storey apartment block, a shop in a three-storey building and a sewing factory.\n\nRegional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said the attacks on the city's Novobazarskyi district, used the \"double tap\" technique that has occurred recently, delivering a second strike soon after an initial attack on a given site.\n\nHe said that, according to preliminary information, S-300 missiles were used.\n\n\"The third, fourth and fifth floors are destroyed, stairwells were destroyed, facades were destroyed,\" Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov told public broadcaster Suspilne, describing damage to the apartment building.\n\nMr Syniehubov said at least two children were among those injured in the attack, which occurred at about midnight local time. He warned that residents could be trapped underneath rubble left by the strike.\n\nSenior Russian security official Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that Russia was not bluffing when it spoke of the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine and that its conflict with the West could escalate into an all-out war.\n\nIn a post on his official Telegram channel, Medvedev said Moscow's conflict with the West was developing according to the worst-case scenario and that \"no one can rule out it escalating to the last stage\".\n\nMedvedev was commenting after four US officials told Reuters on Thursday that Joe Biden had quietly authorised Kyiv to launch US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\n\nChina said Friday it would be \"difficult\" to attend a conference on the war in Ukraine slated to take place in Switzerland next month.\n\n\"The arrangement of the meeting still falls short of China's requirements and the expectations of the international community, making it difficult for China to attend,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.\n\nUkraine is trying to whip up attendance at the June peace conference, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end Russia's war.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part.\n\nBut Beijing insisted on Friday that any such summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.\n\n\"China has always insisted that the International Peace Conference should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans,\" Ms Mao said.\n\n\"Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace,\" she said.\n\nAs fighting rages in the direction of Chasiv Yar, Donetsk, soldiers from the frontline are receiving medical treatment.\n\nRussia has threatened to remove children from their parents in an anti-war dissent crackdown.\n\nChildren have been forced to flee the country, face jail sentences and be placed in orphanages as the pressure piles on parents who dare to question the Kremlin.\n\nAmnesty International said that \"the very bond between children and their parents that is being shamelessly exploited to crush dissent\".\n\n\"In this politically motivated assault on children, schools and teachers have become tools of persecution and arbitrary interference by the state,\" Oleg Kozlovsky, Amnesty's Russia researcher, said.\n\nHe added that schools were indoctrinating children with \"false government-mandated narratives\".\n\nIn many cases known to Amnesty, commissioners for children's rights did not intervene in the politically motivated persecution of children or advocate for their right to freedom of expression.\n\nRussia will retaliate asymmetrically to Ukrainian attacks on its territory using weapons provided by the United States, the RIA news agency cited Andrei Kartapolov, the head of the Russian lower house's defence committee, as saying on Friday.\n\nKartapolov said Joe Biden's decision to allow limited missile strikes inside Russia with US weapons would not impact Russia's military operation in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had hinted strongly this week that a change in Washington's position was coming.\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION GREENLIGHTS UKRAINE'S USE OF AMERICAN WEAPONS TO STRIKE INSIDE RUSSIA\n\n\"This is a matter of upholding international law -- Ukraine's right to self-defense,\" NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. \"Russia has attacked Ukraine, (which) has the right to defend themselves. And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\"\n\n\"If you look at the battlefield now, Russia is launching attacks on Ukraine's soil from Russian soil with artillery, missiles, and massing troops,\" he said. \"And, of course, it makes it very hard for Ukraine to defend themselves if they are not allowed to use advanced weapons to repel those attacks.\"\n\nUkrainian officials had stepped up calls on the U.S. administration to allow their forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, is just 12 miles from the Russian border.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have been increasingly vocal in arguing that the restriction was putting Ukrainian forces in an untenable situation as Russia intensified attacks around Kharkiv.\n\nRussia has been exploiting a lengthy delay in replenishment of U.S. military aid and Western Europe's inadequate military production that has slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield for Ukraine.\n\nThe alliance is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year and leaders will be meeting in Washington in July to reaffirm their support. Stoltenberg said he expects to be able to announce at the summit that at least two-thirds of members are meeting their commitment to spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense.", "source":

This site does not give financial, investment or medical advice.\n\nOn May 31st, Politico headlined \"Biden secretly gave Ukraine permission to strike inside Russia with US weapons: It's a major reversal that will help Ukraine to better defend its second-largest city.\" It reported that\n\nThe Biden administration has quietly given Ukraine permission to strike inside Russia -- solely near the area of Kharkiv -- using U.S.-provided weapons, three U.S. officials and two other people familiar with the move said Thursday, a major reversal that will help Ukraine to better defend its second-largest city.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" one of the U.S. officials said, adding that the policy of not allowing long-range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed.\"\n\nUkraine asked the U.S. to make this policy change only after Russia's offensive on Kharkiv began this month, the official added. All the people were granted anonymity to discuss internal decisions that haven't been announced. ...\n\nIn effect, Ukraine can now use American-provided weapons, such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or Russian bombers launching bombs toward Ukrainian territory. But the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIt's a stunning shift the administration initially said would escalate the war by more directly involving the U.S. in the fight. But worsening conditions for Ukraine on the battlefield -- namely Russia's advances and improved position in Kharkiv -- led the president to change his mind. ...\n\nWhat this means is that if Volodmyr Zelensky (whose legal term of office as Ukraine's President ended on May 20th) decides that Ukraine should use American weapons and bombs to hit \"military targets\" that are in Russia and \"near the area of Kharkiv,\" then the U.S. Government will not object. The article does not say how the phrase \"military targets\" there is being defined, nor how \"near the area of Kharkiv\" is being defined.\n\nThe U.S. Government has been, to a large extent if not fully, operating or in control over the operation of those U.S.-made weapons; and, therefore, one may reasonably presume that any decision as to whether to use those weapons and bombs in any given instance will have the prior approval of both the Ukrainian and the American Governments.\n\nOne also may reasonably assume that if ever Ukraine would violate Biden's order in this regard, then Biden would condemn Ukraine for having done so. Whether or not Russia's Government would take that as being sincerely an expression that only Ukraine was to blame for that U.S.-and-Ukraine attack against Russia is impossible reasonably to predict in advance. Consequently, if the limitations upon what Ukraine's government can do with America's weapons and bombs are not yet already over the limits of what will precipitate a nuclear attack by Russia against the United States and its colonies ('allies'), as having \"crossed over Russia's red lines\" of what Russia considers to constitute an acceptable violation of Russia's national security, then how Russia will respond in any case if Ukraine will violate Biden's command and Biden will condemn Ukraine for that, is likewise impossible reasonably to predict in advance. However, if Russia will in such an instance unleash its estimated 5,580 nuclear weapons against the U.S. and its colonies, then there will be a debate among the immediate survivors of WW3 regarding whether the villain here was Biden or instead Putin, or both.\n\nIf WW3 will happen before America's November 5th elections, then if such elections will be held, either Donald Trump or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be the President starting in 2025. If WW3 will happen after such elections, then America's voters today should know that on May 28th, the Washington Post, headlined \"Trump makes sweeping promises to donors on audacious fundraising tour\", and reported that at one fundraising event for billionaires and centi-millionaires (not for mere voters), \"he suggested that he would have bombed Moscow and Beijing if Russia invaded Ukraine or China invaded Taiwan.\" In other words: to him, regarding the current war in Ukraine, and regarding the long-sought-by-the-U.S.-Government war in Taiwan, those two wars and to-become wars, are not merely \"other people's wars,\" but these are our wars -- meaning those American billionaires' and centi-millionaires' wars -- to which he, as the U.S. President, would respond immediately by bombing, respectively, Russia and China.\n\nThough the CIA-edited and written Wikipedia (which blacklists (blocks from linking to) sites that aren't CIA-approved) says nothing about the former President of Ukraine Volodmyr Zelenskyy being no longer legally after 20 May 2024 Ukraine's President, and he did announce that the 20 May 2024 elections would be cancelled, he still does serve as-if he is Ukraine's President, and is not questioned about that in U.S.-and-allied media. No polling has been done regarding whom Ukrainians would vote for if they were allowed to vote. However, on 15 February 2024, Yahoo News headlined \"New poll shows Zelenskyy's approval dips 5 points in Ukraine after departure of General Zaluzhnyi\" and buried in its news-report that the poll showed that as-of February 24th, the level of \"trust\" in leading political figures by the Ukrainian public were: Valerii Zaluzhnyi - 94%; Kyrylo Budanov - 66%; Volodymyr Zelenskyy - 64%; Serhiy Prytula - 61%; and Oleksandr Syrskyi - 40%. Zaluzhnyi was appointed Ukraine's Ambassador to UK on 7 March 2024, after having been fired by Zelenskyy as Ukraine's top General. Zelenskyy replaced him with Oleksandr Syrskyi. But in any case, Ukraine has been ruled by America's President ever since February 2014, and Russians have long known that this is so.\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\nInvestigative historian Eric Zuesse's latest book, AMERICA'S EMPIRE OF EVIL: Hitler's Posthumous Victory, and Why the Social Sciences Need to Change, is about how America took over the world after World War II in order to enslave it to U.S.-and-allied billionaires. Their cartels extract the world's wealth by control of not only their 'news' media but the social 'sciences' -- duping the public.\n\nfrom https://theduran.com/u-s-president-biden-now-authorizes-ukraine-to-start-ww3/", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_zuesse@therussophile.org", "name": "Eric Zuesse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrylo_Budanov", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrylo Budanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valerii_Zaluzhnyi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valerii Zaluzhnyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Syrskyi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oleksandr Syrskyi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

I think sometimes they are just laughing at this situation,\" Zelenskiy told the Guardian in an interview published on Friday.\n\nThe German government announced on Friday that it would also give Ukraine permission to use weapons it supplied against military targets in Russian territory bordering the Kharkiv region to defend itself against Moscow's attacks.\n\nDuring a visit to Uzbekistan earlier this week, Putin warned against western countries allowing Ukraine to use their weapons to strike Russia. \"This constant escalation can lead to serious consequences,\" the Russian president said on Tuesday, without giving further detail.\n\nPutin also issued a thinly veiled threat against Nato's smaller European members, saying they \"should be aware that they are playing with fire\" because they had small land areas and very dense populations.\n\nIn the lead-up to Biden's decision on Thursday, other western allies including the UK, France and the Netherlands, and the Nato secretary general, also said Ukraine should be able to use western weapons against military targets in Russia.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former Russian president and current deputy chair of the country's security council, called Biden's decision a \"serious escalation of the conflict\".\n\n\"Russia regards all long-range weapons used by Ukraine as already being directly controlled by servicemen from Nato countries. This is no military assistance, this is participation in a war against us,\" he said, adding that Russia would destroy any western weaponry used to attack it \"both in Ukraine and in the territory of other countries\".\n\nMedvedev said it would be a \"crucial mistake\" on the part of the west to believe that Russia was not ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine. He also spoke of the potential to strike unnamed hostile countries with strategic nuclear weapons. \"This is, alas, neither intimidation nor bluffing,\" he said.\n\nThe Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, dismissed warnings by Moscow that the decision to allow Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russian territory might lead to an escalation.\n\n\"This is nothing new. It has ... been the case for a long time that every time Nato allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" Stoltenberg told reporters on Friday on the sidelines of a Nato foreign ministers' meeting in Prague. \"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nWestern countries' approval for the use of their weapons comes amid reports that France is planning to send military trainers to Ukraine, making it the first to publicly deploy troops on the ground.\n\nThe country's president, Emmanuel Macron, could announce the move next week during a visit by Zelenskiy, who will attend a ceremony in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-day.\n\nPutin has said the French move would escalate the situation toward a global conflict, and some senior officials in Moscow have said French trainers would become legitimate targets for Russian troops.\n\nIn the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin frequently invoked Moscow's nuclear arsenal, pledging to use all means necessary to defend his country. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, reportedly after Chinese officials persuaded him to abandon his nuclear threats, but he has recently returned to them.\n\nRussian forces started military drills near Ukraine last week that simulated the use of tactical nuclear weapons, in a move that Moscow said was a warning to the west not to escalate tensions further.\n\nSince the start of the war, Washington has voiced fears of provoking Putin into a nuclear response and drawing the US and Nato into direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nIt has reportedly expressed anger over two Ukrainian drone strikes in the last week against Russian radar stations that provide warning of nuclear launches. At least one of the strikes in the south-eastern Krasnodar region appeared to have caused some damage, according to images circulating on social media.\n\n\"They are sensitive locations because Russia could perceive that its strategic deterrent capabilities are being targeted, which could undermine Russia's ability to maintain nuclear deterrence against the United States,\" an unnamed US official told the Washington Post.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pjotr_sauer@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Pjotr Sauer", "type":

For instance, the F-16 fighters that NATO is already sending to Ukraine can carry nuclear weapons,\" the embassy added. \"When these aircraft are in the air, it is impossible to determine whether the missiles they carry have conventional or nuclear warheads. Therefore, when such a fighter approaches our airspace, we are forced to assume it is conducting a nuclear strike.\"\n\nThis policy shift has found support among key Western leaders. At a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron argued that Ukraine should be able to target certain Russian sites with Western-supplied weapons. \"We must allow them [the Ukrainians] to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired, from which Ukraine is attacked,\" he said.\n\nPoland has also permitted Ukraine to use Polish-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, as confirmed by Deputy Head of the Polish Defense Ministry, Cesary Tomczyk. Similarly, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has so far refused to deliver long-range Taurus missiles to Ukraine, he has agreed to allow German-supplied tanks to be used against targets within Russia.\n\nThe Pentagon had earlier confirmed that the Biden administration had authorized Ukraine to attack targets on Russian territory, specifically targeting the Kharkiv area with US weapons in counter-battery warfare. However, the US has maintained a ban on the use of ATACMS operational tactical missiles and other long-range weaponry.\n\nDenmark has also joined the growing list of countries allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied weaponry against Russian targets, with Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen confirming that F-16 jets can be used to strike targets within Russia.\n\nIn response to these developments, the Russian embassy in Cairo cautioned that \"the West has declared its direct participation in the war against Russia, with a clear potential to escalate into nuclear warfare.\" The embassy further warned that if NATO continues to support attacks on Russian territory, the territories of the United States and its allies, including military installations in other countries, could become legitimate targets for Russian retaliation.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in an interview with Sputnik, echoed these concerns, stating that the US and NATO are seeking to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia and are unconcerned about the fate of Russian civilians. He expressed hope that joint Russian-Belarusian non-strategic nuclear drills would serve as a deterrent to NATO members.\n\nHowever, Lavrov also suggested that the West could potentially expedite a political resolution to the Ukraine crisis by ceasing arms deliveries to Kyiv.\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg downplayed the risk of escalation from Moscow after the United States authorized Ukraine to use American weapons to target sites within Russia.\n\nEarlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened \"serious consequences\" if Western countries allowed Ukraine to use their weapons to strike targets in Russia.", "source": {"uri": "dailynewsegypt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News Egypt"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

said Friday it would be \"difficult\" to attend a conference on the war in Ukraine slated to take place in Switzerland next month.\n\n\"The arrangement of the meeting still falls short of China's requirements and the expectations of the international community, making it difficult for China to attend,\" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.\n\nUkraine is trying to whip up attendance at the June peace conference, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end Russia's war.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part.\n\nBut Beijing insisted on Friday that any such summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.\n\n\"China has always insisted that the International Peace Conference should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans,\" Ms Mao said.\n\n\"Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace,\" she said.\n\n08:32 AM BST\n\nPictured: Soldiers receive treatment in Donetsk\n\nAs fighting rages in the direction of Chasiv Yar, Donetsk, soldiers from the

The new initiatives would represent a shift in NATO's policy of engagement in the war and could further escalate the proxy conflict with Russia.\n\nThe NATO Parliamentary Assembly convened on Monday and urged the alliance to remove a ban currently preventing Ukraine from firing Western weapons directly into Russian territory, echoing calls recently made by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and top officials from Britain, Sweden, Latvia, Poland, and Lithuania. Kyiv has long requested that it be allowed to fire Western-provided weapons into Russia, with officials bemoaning that the NATO ban has prevented them from effectively countering Russia's advances.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken Antony Blinken during a press conference on Wednesday did not signal any immediate policy change plans on how Ukraine is allowed to use U.S. weapons against Russia. But Biden has reportedly already given Kyiv permission to fire into Russian territory, according to the Financial Times, which Blinken failed to mention on Wednesday.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" a U.S. official told Politico on Thursday, adding that the administration's policy stance against long-range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed.\"\n\nBut Moscow has warned that if NATO allows Ukraine to fire their provided weapons into Russian territory, it will escalate the war and potentially drag alliance member nations further into the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that such an action by NATO would represent another escalation that could \"lead to serious consequences.\"\n\n\"Providing Ukraine with the means and the permission to strike deep into Russian territory significantly increases the chances of a direct U.S.-Russian clash, which in turn could lead to the use of nuclear weapons,\" George Beebe, former CIA analyst and director of grand strategy at the Quincy Institute, a non-interventionist foreign policy think tank, told the DCNF. Beebe noted that it was unlikely that Russia would utilize tactical nuclear weapons in the interim but instead potentially target American assets such as satellites, creating \"a cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation with the United States that proves difficult to manage and contain.\"\n\nEven though Ukraine could benefit from using Western weapons to fire against Russia -- as its own domestic weapons are not capable of effective, long-range strikes -- the West's hesitation on the matter may have created a \"hype\" that will invite a Russian retaliatory response, Jim Townsend, an ex-NATO and Pentagon official and senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, a foreign policy think tank led by former Democrat officials, told the DCNF.\n\n\"We have made this such a big deal that it will force the Russians to react one way or another. All of a sudden, it has become a red line drawn by the Russians, highlighted by the U.S. not wanting to escalate,\" Townsend said. \"And now, it has got such a high profile publicly that if we said, 'Yeah, okay, go ahead [and fire into Russian territory],' then you're really putting the Russians in a corner to do something to top that, and who knows what that might be. So I think that certainly does run a risk of escalation, even more so than it did earlier in the war.\"\n\nAside from weapons policy, members of the NATO alliance are also considering the idea of sending troops into Ukraine to help train Ukrainian forces. Ukraine suffers from a worsening manpower shortage and is rapidly recruiting and conscripting new men for the war effort; Kyiv has requested the U.S. and NATO to help train them.\n\nA NATO-backed training presence in Ukraine, which would be the first of its kind since the war began, could bolster the country's fighting abilities against Russia, whose own military does not suffer from the same manpower problems.\n\nBut if NATO-allied troops stationed in Ukraine are caught in the crossfire of an attack from Russia, it could prompt the entire alliance to take much more direct action in the conflict. Article Five of the NATO treaty stipulates that \"an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all\" and the alliance is then obligated to collectively take \"action as it deems necessary,\" including through armed force.\n\n\"Let's say there are French trainers or German trainers in Ukraine, and they're killed in a Russian missile strike,\" Michael DiMino, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities and former CIA official, told the DCNF. \"So now, what do we do? What happens after that? Do we go ahead and avenge those casualties and have the U.S. or France or Germany -- again, all NATO members -- engaged in some kind of limited strike on Russia? Is Russia not going to view that as an act of war and then not respond?\"\n\nIf NATO troops are killed in a Russian attack and the alliance chooses not to pursue retaliation, it could come with the risk of undermining the alliance's promise to defend itself. (RELATED: Brittney Griner Breaks Silence About Russian Detention)\n\n\"Even relatively small numbers of Western boots on the ground would create an enormous incentive for Russia to target them; failure to do so would only encourage the West to believe that Russia would tolerate greater and greater direct Western involvement over time,\" Beebe told the DCNF.\n\nKyiv officials and Zelenskyy will attend a June peace summit in Sweden \"to provide a forum where world leaders discuss paths towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine; over 160 countries have been invited, including the U.S., although Biden has not signaled that he will be in attendance. Kyiv will also have a presence at the annual NATO summit in July, where, among other issues, existing and new initiatives to bolster Ukraine's security will be discussed, potentially including sending troops to the region and lifting Western weapons use restrictions.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He did not disclose additional details on the communication with the U.S.\n\nZelenskiy said he did not yet know the possible restrictions related to the use of long-awaited F-16 fighter jets but appealed to the question of fairness in deliberations, saying Ukraine should be able to retaliate against Russian strikes.\n\nGermany, another major ally, signalled its openness to Ukraine's use of its weapons to strike military sites fueling attacks on Kharkiv region.\n\nFrance has taken a similar stance, saying Ukraine should be allowed to strike military sites Russia is using to attack its territory.\n\n(Reporting by Anastasiia Malenko; Editing by Nick Macfie)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stockholm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stockholm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/559757b/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F7a%2F220d8ac42e24619fe6d844c3f6ed68%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK4U0KB%3A12024-05-31T130916Z_1_LYNXMPEK4U0KB_RTROPTP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZELENSKIY-SWEDEN.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Kharkiv is little more than 30km from the Russian border.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated his message from earlier this week, that the US would continue doing what it had done until now, \"which is, as necessary, adapt and adjust\".\n\nHe was speaking to reporters at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Prague, where the alliance's Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed the decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine's use of weapons.\n\nQuestions have also been raised by Nato allies about the possibility of US-made F-16 warplanes being deployed across the Russian border.\n\nUkrainian pilots have been training on F-16s in recent months and the first planes are expected to reach Ukraine this summer.\n\nDenmark's Defence Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, has said that its F-16s could be used to target weapons depots in Russia which he described as legitimate targets.\n\nDenmark is due to hand over 19 F-16s to Ukraine over the summer and Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen made clear: \"This is not a carte blanche for Ukraine to use the F-16 to make arbitrary attacks into Russia.\"\n\nOn Friday Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen refused to confirm that Danish F-16s could be used over Russian territory. She said the planes were very close to flying over Ukraine, but \"we are not going to go into further detail\".\n\nThe Netherlands has avoided making any clear declaration on F-16s. Foreign Minister Hanke Bruins Slot merely confirmed that the Dutch government would \"allow Ukraine to use arms on Russian soil if it's in full self-defence\", in line with the United Nations charter.\n\nBelgium's Alexander De Croo ruled out allowing Ukraine to use its F-16s over Russia when he met President Zelensky earlier this week. Mr De Croo was meeting President Biden at the White House on Friday.\n\nRussian officials have made clear their anger at the prospect of F-16s being used over their territory. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that F-16s would be destroyed just like anything else supplied by Nato, and would not change the situation at all.\n\nHowever, as F-16s had long been used in Nato's \"so-called joint nuclear missions\", he warned that supplying them to Kyiv could only be seen \"as a deliberate signal from Nato concerning nuclear weapons\".\n\nIf you have any stories or news that

Clearly it's a highly dangerous slippery slope.\n\nOther NATO countries have been openly advocating for hitting Russia with long-range missiles, and have even approved for Kiev to start doing so in a huge escalation. Denmark has even said it's fine with Ukraine attacking Russia with Western-supplied F-16 jets.\n\nUkraine has been complaining that all restrictions need to be taken off if it is to defend against Russia's recent major offensive in Kharkiv, which was launched from across the border. For example, Russian artillery is able to fire from rear positions within the Belgorod region near the border.

they were Ukrainians'", "body": "THIS is the moment bungling Russian troops allegedly opened fire and stormed their own positions believing they were Ukrainians.\n\nDramatic footage shows a Russian assault unit stepping out of a tank before reportedly blowing up their own trench in Novomykhailivka.\n\nThe clip, geolocated by the popular war blogging website Deep State Map, clearly outlines the Russian-Ukraine border.\n\nIt shows Vladimir Putin's troops patrolling in a war tank inside the Russian territory before a bunch of soldiers come out in a mist of chaos.\n\nThe troops then started firing at what they believed was a trench filled with Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThey even stormed the place and blitzed it with rocket launchers - unaware of the fact they were allegedly assaulting their own men.\n\nWithin moments, the Russian assault obliterates the trench with plums of black smoke rising from the position.\n\nThis footage has not been verified by The Sun.\n\nThis is not the first time Russian troops launched an attack on their men by accident.\n\nPanicking Russian soldiers were previously seen blowing up their own men in the village of Andriivka amid a heavy Ukrainian counteroffensive last year.\n\nOne of Putin's soldiers died in the explosion, and the other two were taken prisoner by Ukrainian troops.\n\nThe humiliating moment for Putin comes after US President Joe Biden gave Volodymyr Zelensky the go-ahead to hit inside Russian territories using American weapons.\n\nBiden's secretive decision means US weapons can now be used by Ukraine for \"counter-fire purposes\" on their aggressors.\n\nThe major shake-up comes as Russia continues to attack Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv as they look to seize more Ukrainian territory.\n\nUkraine has been constantly calling for additional support from the West with Biden finally responding with a partial change to US policy in a move that is all but certain to anger an already paranoid Vladimir Putin.\n\nDespite the predicted new ruling, officials have maintained their stance that US weapons shouldn't be offensively used against Russia.\n\nThis means Ukraine isn't allowed to attack Russian civilian infrastructure with any US-supplied weapons.\n\nThey are also still banned from using long-range weapons such as the army tactical missile system (ATACMS).\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said recently: \"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression and escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too.\n\nHe singled out Nato allies saying \"constant escalation can lead to serious consequences\".\n\nDespite the tyrant's strong warning, his own country has bombarded Ukraine with weapons from Iran, North Korea and China so far.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city Kharkiv is now seeing intense fighting as Putin's troops look to push forward into the northeast.\n\nKharkiv's mayor Ihor Terekhov has begged the West to step in and accused Vlad of terrorising its 1.3 million residents and plunging the city into darkness.\n\nRussian attacks on Kharkiv - liberated after six months of Moscow's occupation in September 2022 - have been scaling up dramatically in previous weeks, killing dozens and leaving thousands without electricity.\n\nTerekhov said that unless the West steps up and delivers crucial air defence systems - Kharkiv could suffer the same fate as the Syrian city of Aleppo, which heavy Russian bombing helped to decimate a decade ago.\n\nLast Saturday, at least 18 people were killed after a Russian missile strike hit a retail park in the region sparking a horror inferno.\n\nDramatic footage shows massive plumes of black smoke rising into the Kharkiv sky after the Epicentre construction hypermarket became engulfed by flames.\n\nWitnesses told our Sun reporter on the scene there were 200 people inside the 10,000sqft construction hypermarket.\n\nHero Brit volunteer Tony Ferret, 34, of Rye, Kent, was among those trying to help as the sky filled with black smoke.\n\nHe told The Sun: \"They were trying to move vehicles out of the way so they could get the fire engines in.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine claimed Putin's Russia reached a grim milestone after losing more than 500,000 soldiers in their failing war.\n\nKyiv said Moscow's crumbling army has also lost some 22,000 tanks armoured vehicles and nearly 700 aircraft since the invasion.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Several Ukrainian officials have argued that these attacks could have been thwarted if they had been permitted to strike targets in Belgorod.\n\nOn May 19, Nuland contended that the attacks on Kharkiv have demonstrated that it is \"time\" for the U.S. to assist Ukraine in targeting Russian bases.\n\n\"I think it's time for that, because Russia has obviously escalated this war, including attacking Ukraine's [second-largest] city, Kharkiv, which is not on the front lines, and trying to decimate it without ever having to put a boot on the ground,\" Nuland remarked. \"So I think it is time to give the Ukrainians more help hitting these bases inside Russia.\"\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

Nuland replied, \"Because it's Russia that has escalated this war. Russia has learned how to pull its forces back out of the range where we have allowed Ukraine to use our weapons and get our support. So, they are getting a direct advantage in this war from our hesitation, and they have escalated massively.\"\n\nNuland also argued that the months of delays in American aid to Ukraine have contributed to Russia's recent gains on the battlefield. After over a year of stalemate in Congress, elected officials passed a national security bill in April, sending $61 billion in military aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"I think [Ukraine] can certainly turn this around, Martha. But the six-month delay certainly made a difference. The front line for Ukraine needs the artillery that we are sending,\" Nuland stated. \"They need more air defenses. They need to be able to stop these Russian attacks that are coming from bases inside Russia.\"\n\nNuland stepped down from her position in the administration of President Joe Biden on March 22. She has faced criticism from anti-war and non-interventionist activists for her role in the Euromaidan Revolution of 2014, which set the stage for Russia's special military operation in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. She is considered to be a \"war hawk\" and part of the more extreme elements of the neoconservative and neoliberal interventionist movement. (Related: Victoria Nuland's RESIGNATION spells BAD NEWS for Ukraine.)\n\nNuland, a career foreign service officer, served as Assistant Secretary of State for Europe during the administration of former President Barack Obama, and returned to the White House as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs under Biden. She had been acting deputy Secretary of State but lost out to Kurt Campbell for the permanent role.\n\nNuland's career highlights include serving at the U.S. embassy in Moscow during the 1990s, being U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and acting as the State Department spokeswoman under Hillary Clinton.\n\nShe gained notoriety for her strong defense of Ukraine, especially after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised her for her three and a half decades of service and her pivotal role in shaping U.S. policy, particularly regarding Ukraine.\n\nWatch this episode of the \"Health Ranger Report\" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how both Nuland and Blinken are responsible for pushing for the conflict in Ukraine to escalate into nuclear war.\n\nUkraine \"a classic failed state,\" says former Russian President Medvedev.\n\nWhite House moves toward lifting ban on Ukraine striking targets deep inside Russia with U.S. weapons.\n\nRussian officials designate Zelensky a WAR CRIMINAL and legitimate military target.", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NaturalNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgorod", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgorod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgorod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgorod_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgorod Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Raddatz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martha Raddatz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Individualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revolution of Dignity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Moscow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embassy of the United States, Moscow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Secretary_of_State_for_Political_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_M._Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt M.

All the people were granted anonymity to discuss internal decisions that haven't been announced.\n\nIn the last few days, the U.S. made the decision to allow Ukraine \"flexibility\" to defend itself from attacks on the border near Kharkiv, the second U.S. official said.\n\nIn effect, Ukraine can now use American-provided weapons, such as rockets and rocket launchers, to shoot down launched Russian missiles heading toward Kharkiv, at troops massing just over the Russian border near the city, or Russian bombers launching bombs toward Ukrainian territory. But the official said Ukraine cannot use those weapons to hit civilian infrastructure or launch long-range missiles, such as the Army Tactical Missile System, to hit military targets deep inside Russia.\n\nIt's a stunning shift the administration initially said would escalate the war by more directly involving the U.S. in the fight. But worsening conditions for Ukraine on the battlefield -- namely Russia's advances and improved position in Kharkiv -- led the president to change his mind.\n\nThe National Security Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nClick here to read the full article on Politico.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

Ukrainians'", "body": "THIS is the moment bungling Russian troops allegedly opened fire and stormed their own positions believing they were Ukrainians.\n\nDramatic footage shows a Russian assault unit stepping out of a tank before reportedly blowing up their own trench in Novomykhailivka.\n\nThe clip, geolocated by the popular war blogging website Deep State Map, clearly outlines the Russian-Ukraine border.\n\nIt shows Vladimir Putin's troops patrolling in a war tank inside the Russian territory before a bunch of soldiers come out in a mist of chaos.\n\nThe troops then started firing at what they believed was a trench filled with Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nThey even stormed the place and blitzed it with rocket launchers - unaware of the fact they were allegedly assaulting their own men.\n\nWithin moments, the Russian assault obliterates the trench with plums of black smoke rising from the position.\n\nThe Sun was unable to verify the footage.\n\nThis is not the first time Russian troops launched an attack on their men by accident.\n\nPanicking Russian soldiers were previously seen blowing up their own men in the village of Andriivka amid a heavy Ukrainian counteroffensive last year.\n\nOne of Putin's soldiers died in the explosion, and the other two were taken prisoner by Ukrainian troops.\n\nThe humiliating moment for Putin comes after US President Joe Biden gave Volodymyr Zelensky the go-ahead to hit inside Russian territories using American weapons.\n\nBiden's secretive decision means US weapons can now be used by Ukraine for \"counter-fire purposes\" on their aggressors.\n\nThe major shake-up comes as Russia continues to attack Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv as they look to seize more Ukrainian territory.\n\nUkraine has been constantly calling for additional support from the West with Biden finally responding with a partial change to US policy in a move that is all but certain to anger an already paranoid Vladimir Putin.\n\nDespite the predicted new ruling, officials have maintained their stance that US weapons shouldn't be offensively used against Russia.\n\nThis means Ukraine isn't allowed to attack Russian civilian infrastructure with any US-supplied weapons.\n\nThey are also still banned from using long-range weapons such as the army tactical missile system (ATACMS).\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said recently: \"As the conditions have changed, as the battlefield has changed, as what Russia does has changed in terms of how it's pursuing its aggression and escalation, we've adapted and adjusted too.\n\nUkraine's second-largest city Kharkiv is now seeing intense fighting as Putin's troops look to push forward into the northeast.\n\nKharkiv's mayor Ihor Terekhov has begged the West to step in and accused Vlad of terrorising its 1.3 million residents and plunging the city into darkness.\n\nRussian attacks on Kharkiv - liberated after six months of Moscow's occupation in September 2022 - have been scaling up dramatically in previous weeks, killing dozens and leaving thousands without electricity.\n\nTerekhov said that unless the West steps up and delivers crucial air defence systems - Kharkiv could suffer the same fate as the Syrian city of Aleppo, which heavy Russian bombing helped to decimate a decade ago.\n\nLast Saturday, at least 18 people were killed after a Russian missile strike hit a retail park in the region sparking a horror inferno.\n\nDramatic footage shows massive plumes of black smoke rising into the Kharkiv sky after the Epicentre construction hypermarket became engulfed by flames.\n\nWitnesses told our Sun reporter on the scene there were 200 people inside the 10,000sqft construction hypermarket.\n\nHero Brit volunteer Tony Ferret, 34, of Rye, Kent, was among those trying to help as the sky filled with black smoke.\n\nHe told The Sun: \"They were trying to move vehicles out of the way so they could get the fire engines in.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine claimed Putin's Russia reached a grim milestone after losing more than 500,000 soldiers in their failing war.\n\nKyiv said Moscow's crumbling army has also lost some 22,000

It's really simple.\"\n\nAndrey Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, said: \"Regarding what they are going to strike, it is also quite simple: simple equipment, artillery units, tanks, etcetera, but also, but also the larger targets such as some command and control posts, if they know where they are and logistics you know, airfields.\n\n\"When I say logistics it means like rail cars which carry heavy vehicles, tanks and so on, that are transported by rail and then unloaded. The same kind of thing they would strike in occupied Donbas or Crimea.\"\n\nThe immediate focus will be on the 20-mile stretch of countryside between the city of Belgorod and the border from which the latest Russian offensive launched on May 10.\n\nRob Lee, a senior fellow at the foreign policy research insititue, a US think tank, said American-supplied Himars and European artillery will likely prioritise Russian artillery and launch sites for Lancet attack drones.\n\nThese launch sites have been enjoying considerable success and able to operate largely with impunity from inside Russia, he said.\n\nUkraine could also preemptively target a large Russian force that has been spotted mustering around the village of Graivoron, about 30 miles further west. It is feared that the force may be preparing for an attack on the Sumy region.\n\nFurther afield, several airbases will come within range of British and French Stormshadow missiles. The Baltimor airbase at Voronezh, home to a Russian SU-34 squadron, is probably the most significant of those possible targets.\n\nThe Ukrainians have also been given permission to use air defence missiles to shoot down enemy aircraft which pose a threat. Given the shortage of air defence missiles and the near impossibility of intercepting glide-bombs in flight, destroying aircraft on the ground may, however, be the only realistic way to challenge Russia's increasing dominance of the skies.\n\nThere is still some confusion over the remaining restrictions on Ukraine's army. After the news of Biden's reversal broke on Thursday, one White House official said that the policy in terms of using long-range Atacms missiles \"has not changed\".\n\nThat might mean that the White House has authorised GMLRS but not Atacms strikes across the border. But even that would make a difference.\n\n\"Yes, Russia does degrade [GMLRS] accuracy with electronic warfare jamming, they have become a little less accurate [since they arrived in 2022]. But they have played a very important role for Ukraine, and Ukraine is an artillery-centric army,\" said Mr Lee. \"If they can't use this kind of really important ground-based fires capability it affects how Ukraine fights.\"\n\nThe rapid adjustment of long-standing Western policy follows mounting anxiety about Russian offensives this summer. The attack on Kharkiv forced Ukraine to redeploy forces from what is thought to be the central Russian effort in Donbas. However, so far, that does not appear to have enabled a major Russian breakthrough.\n\nVladimir Putin claimed last week that using precision western weapons for long range strikes inside Russia would amount to a Nato attack on Russia and could warrant an appropriate response.\n\nNato countries, especially smaller ones, should remember that \"as a rule they have small territories with very dense populations,\" the Russian president said. \"That's a factor they should keep in mind before talking about strikes deep in Russian territory.\"\n\nDmitry Suslov, a member of the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defence Policy think tank, on Wednesday called for a \"demonstrative\" nuclear weapons test to deter the West from lifting the strike restrictions.\n\nAsked about those threats, Mr Stoltenberg said on Friday: \"This is nothing new. It has ... been the case for a long time that every time Nato allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nKeir Giles, fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, believes Russia's current nuclear rhetoric is a long way below the threshold of genuine threat.\n\n\"I've sat next to Suslov at a Nato conference. He's been saying this kind of thing for years - since long before the full scale invasion.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [],

Blinken left open the possibility on Friday that President Biden could allow Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike at a broader array of targets inside Russia, going beyond attacks he has approved on launch sites the Russians are using for their current assault on the Kharkiv area.\n\n\"Going forward, we'll continue to do what we've been doing, which is: As necessary, adapt and adjust,\" Mr. Blinken said at a news conference in Prague at the end of a two-day meeting of top diplomats from member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nMr. Blinken was responding to a reporter's question on whether the United States might give permission for Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deeper into Russia. The phrase \"adapt and adjust\" is one that Mr. Blinken used in a news conference on Wednesday in Chisinau, Moldova, to suggest that Mr. Biden was about to make a major policy shift and grant Ukraine permission to use the weapons to strike in Russia, as Ukrainian and European leaders had been urging for weeks.\n\nAmerican officials then said on Thursday that Mr. Biden had made that decision in recent days and told the Ukrainians, but that the permission to strike in Russia was limited to sites the Russians were using for the assault on Kharkiv. U.S. officials said the ban on Ukraine using weapons for \"long range\" attacks in Russia had not changed.\n\nBut Mr. Blinken's remarks on Friday suggested the ban could change, depending on shifts in battlefield conditions and the direction of the war. He did say, though, that the United States was \"proceeding deliberately as well as effectively.\" That included ensuring Ukrainian soldiers had the necessary training to use new weapons systems and the capacity to maintain them, he said.\n\nAmerican officials say the policy shift means Ukrainian attacks with U.S. weapons in Russia can be pre-emptive, but can only take place within Russian areas near Kharkiv that the Pentagon has designated and that U.S. military officials have communicated to their Ukrainian counterparts.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi\u0219in\u0103u", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chi\u0219in\u0103u"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chi\u0219in\u0103u"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Moldova"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/31/multimedia/31weapons-blinken-zbpc/31weapons-blinken-zbpc-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

It's really simple.\"\n\nAndrey Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, said: \"Regarding what they are going to strike, it is also quite simple: simple equipment, artillery units, tanks, etcetera, but also, but also the larger targets such as some command and control posts, if they know where they are and logistics you know, airfields.\n\n\"When I say logistics it means like rail cars which carry heavy vehicles, tanks and so on, that are transported by rail and then unloaded. The same kind of thing they would strike in occupied Donbas or Crimea.\"\n\nThe immediate focus will be on the 20-mile stretch of countryside between the city of Belgorod and the border from which the latest Russian offensive launched on May 10.\n\nRob Lee, a senior fellow at the foreign policy research insititue, a US think tank, said American-supplied Himars and European artillery will likely prioritise Russian artillery and launch sites for Lancet attack drones.\n\nThese launch sites have been enjoying considerable success and able to operate largely with impunity from inside Russia, he said.\n\nUkraine could also preemptively target a large Russian force that has been spotted mustering around the village of Graivoron, about 30 miles further west. It is feared that the force may be preparing for an attack into the Sumy region.\n\nFurther afield, several airbases will come within range of British and French Stormshadow missiles. The Baltimor airbase at Voronezh, home to a Russian SU-34 squadron, is probably the most significant of those possible targets.\n\nThe Ukrainians have also been given permission to use air defence missiles to shoot down enemy aircraft which pose a threat. Given the shortage of air defence missiles and the near impossibility of intercepting glide-bombs in flight, destroying aircraft on the ground may, however, be the only realistic way to challenge Russia's increasing dominance of the skies.\n\nThere is still some confusion over the remaining restrictions on Ukraine's army. After the news of Biden's reversal broke on Thursday, one White House official said that the policy in terms of using long-range Atacms missiles \"has not changed\".\n\nThat might mean the White House has authorised GMLRS but not Atacms strikes across the border. But even that would make a difference.\n\n\"Yes, Russia does degrade [GMLRS] accuracy with electronic warfare jamming, they have become a little less accurate [since they arrived in 2022]. But they have played a very important role for Ukraine, and Ukraine is an artillery-centric army,\" said Mr Lee. \"If they can't use this kind of really important ground-based fires capability it affects how Ukraine fights.\"\n\nThe rapid adjustment of long-standing Western policy follows mounting anxiety about Russian offensives this summer. The attack on Kharkiv forced Ukraine to redeploy forces from what is thought to be the central Russian effort in Donbas. However, so far, that does not appear to have enabled a major Russian breakthrough.\n\nVladimir Putin claimed last week that using precision western weapons for long range strikes inside Russia would amount to a Nato attack on Russia and could warrant an appropriate response.\n\nNato countries, especially smaller ones, should remember that \"as a rule they have small territories with very dense populations,\" the Russian president said. \"That's a factor they should keep in mind before talking about strikes deep in Russian territory.\"\n\nDmitry Suslov, a member of the Moscow-based Council for Foreign and Defence Policy think tank, on Wednesday called for a \"demonstrative\" nuclear weapons test to deter the West from lifting the strike restrictions.\n\nAsked about those threats, Mr Stoltenberg said on Friday: \"This is nothing new. It has ... been the case for a long time that every time NATO allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\" he told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"And an escalation - well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\"\n\nKeir Giles, fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, believes Russia's current nuclear rhetoric is a long way below the threshold of genuine threat.\n\n\"I've sat next to Suslov at a Nato conference. He's been saying this kind of thing for years - since long before the full scale invasion.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nSix people were killed, according to Syniehubov, and at least 25 were wounded.\n\nUkrainian officials have previously accused Russia of targeting rescue workers by hitting residential buildings with two consecutive missiles -- the first one to draw emergency crews to the scene and the second one to wound or kill them. Russia used the method in Syria's civil war.\n\nApart from Kharkiv, Moscow's troops are pressing in the Donetsk region further south and are assembling a force for an expected attack in the Sumy region further north, according to Ukrainian officials.", "source": {"uri": "nationthailand.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation Thailand"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Russia and Ukraine, after all, share an extensive border, which provides Ukraine with an ideal position to launch such missiles. From the current center of fighting in Kharkiv, a missile could travel for more than 200 miles into Russia, placing Crimea and southern Russia well within range.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, Putin's comments seemed over-the-top. After all, hadn't President Biden always indicated that the U.S. drew the line at providing weapons to Ukraine that could strike the Russian homeland? Throughout the conflict, the American position had been to limit the Ukraine conflict to the borders of that country to assiduously avoid a regional conflict. Yet on Tuesday, Putin was warning against just such an escalation.\n\nRegrettably, Politico provided a more complete picture of what happened just 48 hours later. On Thursday of this week, Politico reported that President Biden will allow US ATACMS missiles to be provided to Ukraine.\n\nPolitico directly quotes from unnamed sources within the White House:\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" one of the U.S. officials said, adding that the policy of not allowing long-range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed.\"\n\nSo, to clarify, the Biden Administration will provide Ukraine with specific long-range missiles (ATACMS) for a battle in Kharkiv, where both forces are in close proximity. It's like using the proverbial baseball bat to strike a fly -- a weapon that's more appropriate for long-range targets far removed from Kharkiv.\n\nSimply put, this move is part of the Biden Administration's ongoing deception regarding Ukraine. Even the premise is not accurate. The ATACMS Missile System, or more precisely the Army Tactical Missile System, is a highly sophisticated battlefield armament that requires a complete array of components to function.\n\nThe American Global Positioning System (GPS) provides guidance for the ATACMS. The missiles are operated within the framework of the American Electronic battlefield, which provides specific targeting for the highly trained technicians who operate the missile launching systems. The ATACMS can be fired from either the HIMARS or MLRS platforms, two of the most advanced systems in the American inventory.\n\nAuthorization for using these advanced weapons was part of that $61 Billion aid package Congress provided for Ukraine just a couple of weeks ago. The President and his Administration are not wasting any time putting these missiles into the battlefield.\n\nThat, at least, is how Vladimir Putin sees it. There can be little doubt that Putin has \"pierced the veil.\" He sees through America as Ukraine's support to America as belligerent. Any attack by American Missiles, supported by American positioning and guidance and American technicians, will be viewed by Putin as an American attack on Russia.<", "source": {"uri": "independentsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.independentsentinel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_reavill@independentsentinel.com", "name": "David Reavill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-140_ATACMS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MGM-140 ATACMS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M142_HIMARS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M142 HIMARS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiple rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global Positioning System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.independentsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/M57A1_Army_Tactical_Missile_System_missile-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

President Joe Biden has lifted restrictions on Ukraine using weapons supplied by the United States against targets on Russian territory, but only to defend the under-fire Kharkiv region, a senior US official said Thursday.

Does he even know what he's doing?\n\nUkraine allegedly asked for this policy change, and, of course, we gave it the okay. If they hit deep into Russia with US weapons, they will be attacking civilians.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin reacted to media reports of the shift in American policy. Western accounts of the situation in the Kharkiv Region fail to show the entire picture, he said, pointing out that Kiev has been striking Russia's Belgorod Region for months and ignored multiple warnings that Moscow would have to act to create a buffer zone to halt the attacks.\n\nPutin added that the constant escalation of the Ukraine conflict \"may lead to serious consequences.\"\n\n\"If those consequences happen in Europe, how will the US act, considering our parity in strategic arms?\" he asked.\n\nDo you think Russia is bluffing?\n\nZeihan has a different take and isn't as alarmed by the threat. He discusses the repercussions with less concern. He says Medvedev has no sway when he claims this is a red line.

Having worked there for many years, he speaks Ukrainian fluently and is well-known for his candid, non-diplomatic statements. Currently, he holds an official role in the Czech government as a Special Representative for the Eastern Partnership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nWe met in Prague, where NATO foreign ministers are negotiating.\n\nCzechia is using every opportunity to influence these negotiations, explaining to others that the ban on striking military targets in Russia should be lifted.\n\nRead more in the full interview by Sergiy Sydorenko, a European Pravda editor - \"We will see a 'black swan' scenario for Russia and then it will lose everything.\" An interview from Prague.\n\nMilitary targets or clusters of military force and human force on Russian territory are legitimate targets for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nSo Ukraine is only doing what is guaranteed by international law.\n\nNot striking military targets in Russia is like fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\n\nMoods in Europe are changing greatly. Last year, there was great euphoria here, expecting a counteroffensive. But when the counteroffensive turned out to be what it was, these moods shifted to pessimism.\n\nNow we have a situation where neither the aggressor nor the victim has enough strength to defeat the other. But there is an important difference between them. Ukraine is fighting a holy war, a war for independence, which gives it a moral advantage. And we cannot say that about the Russian army or Russian society.\n\nVictory means the complete restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity, including Crimea. Victory should also address the question \"what next\": we say, among other things, that Russia must compensate Ukraine for all damages.\n\nVictory must also answer the question of what should happen to Russia next. But here I will refrain from specifics.\n\nBesides, I believe that Russia is a very fragile structure that can be easily broken.\n\nTherefore, it seems to me that at some point we will see a 'black swan' scenario for Russia. Then everything in Russia will come to an end.\n\nThis turning point can happen at any moment.\n\nWe must not forget that Russia is our strategic opponent, who has challenged not only Ukraine but all of us. Therefore, there can be no compromise here, no \"meeting halfway.\"\n\nEither Russia wins, or Ukraine wins along with Western countries.\n\nI think that gradually we will also cross the 'red line' regarding strikes on military targets in Russia, which some NATO countries still adhere to - let me emphasise, not all.\n\nThere are talks about shooting down 'illegal flying objects' - missiles and drones - from the territory of Ukraine's neighbouring states.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, time is definitely on Ukraine's side. But now time is against Ukraine.\n\nI believe it is very important to bring them to Ukraine. When representatives of other countries, MPs, see Kharkiv, see the front line, meet with the military and hear about what these people did before the war, what careers and lives they had, this human approach greatly changes the perspective and perception of the war.\n\nWestern representatives who have visited Ukraine perceive it differently than those who have never been there.", "source": {"uri": "eurointegration.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Pravda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Pravda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black swan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Czech_Republic", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the Czech Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algerian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://img.eurointegration.com.ua/images/doc/d/c/dcb1c7c--nato-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614501", "eventUri": "eng-9614501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The aircraft come with a complete package including training, technical equipment and methodological support for radar reconnaissance and air combat management. The equipment also includes Stockholm's entire stock of APC 302 armored personnel carriers, an unspecified number of 155 mm artillery shells and the Rb 99 (AMRAAM) fighter robot, which can be used both on aircraft and in ground-based air defense systems.\n\nRussian electronic warfare is hampering Ukraine's use of western weapon systems. Ukraine has withdrawn certain American artillery systems from combat because Russian jamming of their precision-guidance systems has reduced the accuracy of their expensive shells to just 10%. In addition, Russia's electronic warfare has severely curtailed the operations of Ukrainian pilots, who lack the sophisticated countermeasures available on F-16s. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden reportedly has reversed long-standing American policy and authorized the use of U.S. weapons across the border in the Kharkiv region. The U.S. has directed Ukraine to use these weapons only to strike forces and military sites involved in Russia's invasion. Russia warned one week ago that it would retaliate for the use of western weapons on its soil by attacking western targets outside Ukraine. The Kremlin, however, has not yet commented on Biden's reported policy change.\n\nCulture Front.\n\nA symbolically named group, the Cultural Forces, a special division of Ukraine's armed forces, has started a 40-day tour across the United States to \"thank the American people for resolute support in helping Ukraine restore its territory and returning peace to Europe.\" The group will visit cities including New York, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Washington D.C. Most of the participating musicians have fought in some of the fiercest battles at the front and several were seriously wounded but returned to military service after rehabilitation.\n\nUkrainian Artists in New York.

Recently, former US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland declared that Kiev should launch strikes into Russian territory using NATO weaponry. According to her, Washington should authorize such attacks with American weapons, reflecting the heightened bellicosity among supporters of the neo-Nazi regime in Kiev.\n\nVictoria Nuland is a key figure behind the Kiev regime, having played a major role in the 2014 Maidan coup and the subsequent policies of Nazification and de-Russification of Ukraine. Her recent resignation from the State Department has been interpreted by many experts as a sign of desperation, given the imminent collapse of the Ukrainian military.\n\nDespite leaving office, Nuland continues to advocate for increased US involvement in the conflict and for greater violence against Russia. She has publicly urged Washington to permit Kiev to use American weapons against targets deep within Russia, including military bases outside the conflict zone. Nuland argues that such preemptive attacks are necessary to prevent Russian operations, portraying them as a strategic imperative in the current military context.\n\n\"They need to be able to stop these Russian attacks that are coming from bases inside Russia (...) The United States and our allies ought to give them more help in hitting Russian bases, which heretofore we have not been willing to do (...) Those bases ought to be fair game, whether they are where missiles are being launched from or where they are where troops are being supplied from,\" she stated.\n\nNuland's rationale for attacking bases outside the conflict zone is a gross distortion of international law. While military targets are legitimate in wartime, targeting cities deep inside Russia would violate the conflict's boundaries. According to Kiev and the West, the war aims to regain Ukrainian territory within the 1991 borders. Therefore, attacking deep within Russia would breach Kiev's own stated limits of military action.\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize that Ukrainian attacks on Russian cities outside the martial law zone occur daily. Whether or not the US \"allows\" it, Ukrainians frequently conduct operations deep into Russian territory, predominantly targeting civilians. These incursions can thus be described as acts of terrorism. Nuland is merely requesting official sanction for what Kiev already does: kill Russian civilians in demilitarized areas.\n\nAny knowledgeable specialist will affirm that the regime's priority targets are civilians. Unable to achieve victory on the battlefield and with its army nearing collapse, Ukraine resorts to terrorizing ordinary Russians to bolster its image and gain Western support. Furthermore, deeper strikes into Russia enable Western propaganda to portray Ukrainian artillery as \"efficient\" and \"capable of winning,\" thereby renewing Western resolve. Nuland seeks to prolong the war at a time when Western allies seem increasingly disillusioned with Ukraine's prospects.\n\nNuland's pronouncements are unsurprising. Her resignation appears to be a strategic maneuver allowing her to continue promoting war outside official scrutiny. Now free from the constraints of office, she can act without accountability, making her position even more advantageous. She can continue her previous actions without the risk of causing problems for the American government.\n\nFor Russia, Nuland's words underscore that diplomatic and peaceful resolutions are futile. The only way to protect nonviolent Russian cities from Ukrainian aggression is through military force. Moscow will likely intensify its use of artillery and aviation against Ukrainian strategic facilities to prevent further civilian attacks.\n\nTo sum it all up, the West's endorsement of Nuland's aggressive stance only serves to exacerbate the conflict. Her call for attacks on Russian territory, justified by a warped interpretation of international law, reveals a dangerous willingness to escalate violence. This rhetoric not only endangers innocent lives but also undermines any hope for a peaceful resolution. The international community must condemn such warmongering and strive for a diplomatic solution to the conflict, prioritizing the protection of civilians and the restoration of peace.", "source":

Germany followed suit to match the new U.S. policy earlier today. (Reuters; Washington Post)\n\nAlthough narrow in its immediate effect, Biden's decision marks a major shift in his policy toward the war in Ukraine. Since the conflict began in February 2022, Biden has been clear in mandating that no U.S.-supplied weapons be used to strike targets outside Ukraine's borders, out of fear that doing so would escalate the conflict to involve more parties.\n\nIndeed, fear of escalation has in many ways come to define U.S. policy toward the war in Ukraine. Since before the war began, Russian President Vladimir Putin has routinely issued threats over the West's aid to Ukraine. And while Western leaders have tried to present a united front against Putin, they have varied somewhat in their responses to these threats, with some arguing the West should call Putin's bluff, while others -- like Biden -- have often argued that doing so is not worth the risk.\n\nIn this case, though, the U.S. clearly came to the conclusion that the risks of not allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russia, at least in a limited capacity, outweigh the risks that doing so will actually lead to escalation.\n\nThe reason why the U.S. calculus changed in part comes down to the specific circumstances of Russia's latest offensive, which began on May 10 in Ukraine's northeast. Moscow has since concentrated its latest assault on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which sits close enough to the border that Russia can easily carry out attacks from its own territory. As a result, the Biden administration faced increased pressure to alter its own red line to ensure that Russia's current assault on Kharkiv does not become a true turning point in the war.\n\nWhile the effect of Russia's current offensive on the war's trajectory remains to be seen, it is clear that there has been a shift in the war's overall shape. After months of relatively few battlefield developments -- so few that a Ukrainian general called the state of the war a \"stalemate\" -- the past two months, beginning with the U.S. approval of a long-delayed aid package to Ukraine, have seen a flurry of changes, both on the battlefield and off.\n\nThe biggest shifts may be yet to come. Next week, French President Emmanuel Macron is reportedly expected to unveil a plan to send military trainers from some of Kyiv's allies in the West to Ukraine, a move that would yet again cross a line that has so far been avoided out of fear of escalation.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump was convicted yesterday of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal in the lead-up to the country's 2016 presidential election. The guilty verdict now raises questions about how, or even if, Trump's conviction will affect the upcoming presidential election, in which Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nBut the conviction also sits in stark contrast to the accountability faced by former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whose story at one point followed a similar trajectory to Trump's, but has since veered in a different direction. While Trump remains in the U.S. presidential race, Bolsonaro is banned from running for elective office again until 2030.\n\nFrida Ghitis explained in January how the two countries' democracies took such different paths:\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. struck 13 Houthi targets in several locations in Yemen yesterday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the rebel movement. Houthi rebels said the airstrikes killed at least 16 people and injured another 35.\n\nHouthi rebels, backed by Iran, have routinely attacked merchant shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the war in Gaza. As Alexander Clarkson wrote in January, the attacks are a reminder that in most conflicts, economic advantages are not enough to override deeply embedded ideological worldviews.\n\nIceland votes in a presidential election tomorrow.

Several NATO countries, including the United States, have given Ukraine the green light to fire at Russia.\n\n\"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use US supplied-weapons for counterfire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them,\" a U.S. official told CNN Thursday.\n\nToday Secretary of State Antony Blinken elaborated at a NATO conference in Prague: \"Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg echoed Blinken's comments, stating, \"Allies have for many years, or since this war started back in 2022, accepted that their weapons are used also for strikes against legitimate targets inside [Russia]. For instance, United Kingdom has provided Storm Shadow cruise missiles for a long time without any restrictions.... Russia has attacked Ukraine, [which] has the right to defend themselves. And that includes also attacking military legitimate targets inside Russia.\"\n\nGermany, once reluctant to provoke Russia, is jumping on the bandwagon as well. As noted by Politico:\n\n\"In recent weeks, Russia has prepared, coordinated and carried out attacks from positions in the Kharkiv area, in particular from the directly adjacent Russian border region,\" German government spokesperson Steffen Hebestreit said Friday.\n\nUkraine \"has the right, guaranteed under international law, to defend itself against these attacks,\" he added. \"To do so, it can use the weapons supplied for this purpose in accordance with its international legal obligations, including those supplied by us.\"\n\nIn recent days Chancellor Olaf Scholz had underscored Ukraine's right to defend itself by striking targets inside Russia in accordance with international law, but had remained vague on whether Berlin had given Ukraine permission to use German-provided weapons to do so.\n\nScholz has so far refused to send Ukraine its long-range Taurus cruise missiles, which could be used to strike deep into Russian territory, arguing it could bring Germany into direct confrontation with Russia. But Germany has provided other weapons systems that could potentially be used to strike targets inside Russia near the city of Kharkiv, including self-propelled howitzers and Mars II rocket launchers.\n\nThe reality is that such strikes are likely to go beyond merely attacking Russian forces gathered near the border of Ukraine. Medium-to-long-range missile and drone strikes on military bases, airfields, fuel depots, and oil refineries are possible.\n\nIn fact, this past weekend, Ukraine struck two of Russia's advanced early warning radar stations -- used to detect incoming nuclear missiles -- that covered the Middle East, North Africa, Iran, and Central Asia. In other words, the radar installations covering the area where the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet roams have now been (potentially) rendered inoperable. While such strikes serve no military purpose for Ukraine -- since the radars did not even cover Ukraine -- this could prove advantageous to U.S. forces in the region, leading many to speculate that the strikes were carried out at the behest of the United States.\n\nRussia, for its part, has not remained silent on this new potential escalation.\n\nRussian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev warned on Telegram, \"NATO countries that have approved strikes with their weapons on Russian territory should be aware that their equipment and specialists will be destroyed not only in Ukraine, but also at any point from where Russian territory is attacked.... All their military equipment and specialists fighting against us will be destroyed both on the territory of former Ukraine and on the territory of other countries, should strikes be carried out from there against Russian territory.\"\n\nMedvedev also noted that Ukraine's long-rage missile systems are \"directly operated by servicemen from NATO countries,\" amounting to direct participation in the war.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin gave a warning of his own, telling reporters Tuesday while on a state visit to Uzbekistan,\n\nIf [Stoltenberg] is talking about potentially attacking Russia's territory with long-range precision weapons, he, as a person who heads a military-political organisation, even though he is a civilian like me, should be aware of the fact that long-range precision weapons cannot be used without space-based reconnaissance. This is my first point.\n\nMy second point is that the final target selection and what is known as launch mission can only be made by highly skilled specialists who rely on this reconnaissance data, technical reconnaissance data. For some attack systems, such as Storm Shadow, these launch missions can be put in automatically, without the need to use Ukrainian military. Who does it? Those who manufacture and those who allegedly supply these attack systems to Ukraine do. This can and does happen without the participation of the Ukrainian military. Launching other systems, such as ATACMS, for example, also relies on space reconnaissance data, targets are identified and automatically communicated to the relevant crews that may not even realise what exactly they are putting in. A crew, maybe even a Ukrainian crew, then puts in the corresponding launch mission. However, the mission is put together by representatives of NATO countries, not the Ukrainian military.\n\nSo, these officials from NATO countries, especially the ones based in Europe, particularly in small European countries, should be fully aware of what is at stake. They should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into the Russian territory. It is a serious matter and, without a doubt, we are watching this very carefully.\n\nPerhaps in retaliation for the announcements made by NATO leaders, Russia on Thursday fired a Kinzhal hypersonic missile at a staging area for NATO weapons in western Ukraine near Lviv, killing up to 300 people, including NATO advisors.\n\nAs NATO nations become more desperate in their attempt to defeat Putin's Russia, the risk of dangerous escalation increases. If America's leaders would simply follow the non-interventionist foreign policy of the country's Founders and stay out of Europe's wars, this conflict would end quickly. If not, there is a real potential for WWIII breaking out over the next year.", "source": {"uri": "thenewamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New American"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Luis Suarez's hat-trick was relegated to a support act as Messi, who also scored a goal, continued his outstanding run of form for the Florida outfit on Saturday.\n\nNew York went ahead on the half-hour at Chase stadium through Dante Vanzeir, who thumped home a first-time effort after Wikelman Carmon's shot cannoned off the far post.\n\nMatias Rojas put Inter Miami on level terms by receiving Messi's pass before curling a 20-yard effort into the top-right corner, reports Xinhua.\n\nRojas and Suarez then linked up before the latter's deft pass released Messi, who gave his side the lead by firing home from 12 yards.\n\nInter Miami extended their advantage just after the hour through the impressive Rojas, who ran onto Messi's sublime through ball and sent a delightful chip over the head of goalkeeper Carlos Coronel.\n\nThe almost telepathic understanding between Messi and Suarez was on display as the Uruguayan striker sent an acrobatic volley into the far corner after the Inter Miami captain's lofted cross.\n\nThe former Barcelona teammates were irrepressible, and they again exchanged a series of slick passes before Suarez stroked home his side's fifth goal.\n\nSuarez, who joined Inter Miami on a free transfer in January, added to New York's misery by running onto Messi's pass and rounding Coronel before threading home his third goal from the tightest of angles.\n\nThe visitors grabbed a late consolation goal when Emil Forsberg converted from the spot after Marcelo Weigandt's mistimed challenge on John Tolkin.\n\nThe result leaves Inter Miami three points clear of second-placed Cincinnati in the Eastern Conference standings while New York Red Bulls remain fourth with 17 points.\n\nMessi has now scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in 11 games for Inter Miami this season while Suarez has 12 goals and seven assists in 15 outings.\n\nInter Miami manager Gerardo Martino hailed the attacking partnership of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in the team's 6-2 home rout of New York Red Bulls on Saturday.\n\n\"Messi always makes the difference,\" Martino told a news conference after the match at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale. \"Today the partnership between him and Luis in the second half worked very well, like in old times. They really were very influential in the game.\"\n\nThe other player to impress for Inter Miami was Paraguayan midfielder Matias Rojas, who scored twice and also showed a remarkable understanding with Messi. \"The truth is that everyone had a phenomenal impact in the game, but Leo probably did something historic with five assists and a goal,\" Martino said.\n\n\"I always say the same thing: it is redundant to talk about him [Messi] because it seems like he always does something new. If something was missing it was this: having an impact on the six goals that a team scores. It's going to be difficult to see something like this again.\"\n\nDespite the emphatic nature of the win, Martino said his team had plenty of scope for improvement. \"I think that in the first half, we couldn't find the passes between the lines,\" he said. \"We couldn't advance on the outside either because of the way they were set up. We knew we had to take some more risks and move the ball with more authority, which we did in the second half,\" the Argentine coach added.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_india@thehansindia.com", "name": "Hans India", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tolkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Tolkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emil Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Martino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Martino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/05/05/1444060-messi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Messi centered a pass to Rojas whose left-footed shot landed under the crossbar.\n\nSu\u00e1rez then fed a charging Messi with a touch pass to beat New York goalkeeper Carlos Coronel with a shot from 15 yards.\n\nRojas made it 3-1 with his second goal in the 62nd minute on an assist from Messi.\n\nMessi then contributed on former Barcelona teammate Su\u00e1rez's first goal in the 69th minute.\n\nSu\u00e1rez also struck in the 75th and 81st minutes before the Red Bulls (4-2-5, 17 points) closed the scoring on Emil Forsberg's penalty kick in stoppage time.\n\nNew York controlled possession early and eventually capitalized on a Miami defensive breakdown that resulted on Dante Vanzeir's goal in the 30th minute. Jos\u00e9 Carmona ran deep into the right wing of the large area and blasted a shot that bounced off the far post. An unmarked Vanzeir retrieved the deflection and converted from 15 yards.\n\nMessi had his only scoring opportunity of the first half in the 24th minute, when Coronel stopped his shot from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nMessi's former Barcelona teammate Jordi Alba missed his third straight game because of a hamstring injury.\n\nBoth clubs will continue MLS play next Saturday. Inter Miami will visit CF Montreal while the Red Bulls will host New England.

The 36-year-old, however, looks like he is back to peak fitness and is producing at the highest level.\n\nFresh from picking up the Player-of-the-Month award for April, Lionel Messi went and did one better against New York Red Bulls. He helped his side overcome a 1-0 deficit in the second half with a stunning performance that saw him notch up a goal and five assists.\n\nThe performance makes him the first player in MLS history to assist five goals in a single game. He also set a new record for most goal contributions in a single MLS game, with his six goal contributions taking him to 22 for the season.\n\nLionel Messi has now appeared in eight games in the MLS this season, and has ten goals and 12 assists to his name. His contribution against New York Red Bulls helped his side remain on top of the Eastern Conference standings with 24 points, albeit having played one game more than every other team. Cincinnati follow them on 21 points from 11 games.\n\nLionel Messi masterclass propels Inter Miami to win\n\nLionel Messi produced another vintage performance for Inter Miami as they claimed a comfortable 6-2 win over New York Red Bulls to begin May on a winning note.

Their talisman was available for the return fixture at their Chase Stadium home, and he showed why he was needed.\n\nThe visitors took a first-half lead through Dante Vanzeir and held onto their advantage until half-time. At the break, Inter Miami boss Gerardo Martino made a change, introducing Paraguayan forward Matias Rojas for David Ruiz.\n\nWithin two minutes of the start of the second half, Messi found Rojas with a simple square pass, and he curled in an equaliser from outside the box. Two minutes later, Lionel Messi got his name on the scoresheet with a fine finish off a Luis Suarez assist.\n\nMessi continued to create as he played a delightful defence-splitting ball for Rojas to score his second of the evening. He then provided Luis Suarez with a delectable cross for the Uruguayan to volley home.\n\nLionel Messi was not done, as he played Suarez in to score their fifth goal after a delightful passing move between them.

He also set a new benchmark for the most goal contributions in a game as he recorded six.\n\nTo make his achievement even greater, both records were broken during the second half of the match.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Inter Miami boss Martino said: \"Messi had exceptional games in Barcelona, during my time with him. But I also remember a semifinal with Paraguay in the Copa America in Chile, where he didn't score a goal and he was still the best player on the field. In Barcelona, he had a game against Valencia where we were losing 2-0 and then won 3-2 with three goals from him.\n\n\"And there was another against Sevilla where we were losing 1-0 and then he scored three goals and we won 4-1.

Messi's incredible form saw him clinch the MLS Player of the Month Award for April, marking his scoring and assisting streak in six consecutive league matches.\n\n\"It has become redundant but it appears that he is always making history,\" Inter Miami coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino said. \"If something was missing, it was this - to contribute in six goals.\"\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez scored three goals, and Matias Rojas scored twice as Inter Miami got six unanswered goals to come back from a 1-0 halftime deficit. Messi and Su\u00e1rez now have a league-leading 10 goals each, helping keep Inter Miami (7-2-3, 24 points) atop the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe win extended Miami's unbeaten streak to six. The streak began after a 4-0 loss at New York on April 20, in which Messi did not play because of an injury.\n\n\"When he is not available, obviously, the team feels it,\" Martino said.\n\nMiami began the rout with Rojas' equalizer in the 48th minute. Messi centered a pass to Rojas, whose left-footed shot landed under the crossbar.\n\nSu\u00e1rez then fed a charging Messi with a touch pass, and he beat New York goalkeeper Carlos Coronel with a shot from 15 yards.\n\nRojas made it 3-1 with his second goal in the 62nd minute on an assist from Messi. The 28-year-old Rojas joined Inter Miami on April 23 and entered the match to start the second half.\n\n\"This is the ultimate satisfaction for a goal scorer,\" Rojas said. \"It makes it even more special because we accomplished it at home.\"\n\nMessi then contributed to former Barcelona teammate Su\u00e1rez's first goal in the 69th minute.\n\n\"Leo makes it easier for all of us,\" Su\u00e1rez said. \"We know each other long enough. When we are on the pitch, we know how to spot each other without looking.\"\n\nSu\u00e1rez also struck in the 75th and 81st minutes before the Red Bulls (4-2-5, 17 points) closed the scoring on Emil Forsberg's penalty kick in stoppage time.\n\n\"We have many players that are capable of scoring,\" Martino said. \"At some points in the match, we are going to find favorable moments. The issue is how we limit the unfavorable moments.\"\n\nNew York controlled possession early and eventually capitalized on a Miami defensive breakdown that resulted in Dante Vanzeir's goal in the 30th minute. Jos\u00e9 Carmona ran deep into the right wing of the large area and blasted a shot that bounced off the far post. An unmarked Vanzeir retrieved the deflection and converted from 15 yards.\n\nMessi had his only scoring opportunity of the first half in the 24th minute, when Coronel stopped his shot from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nMessi's former Barcelona teammate Jordi Alba missed his third straight game because of a hamstring injury.\n\nBoth clubs will continue MLS play next Saturday.

The Red Bulls had defeated a Messi-less Miami back in March and Inter paid them all back with their ferocious second-half performance. It was Dante Vanzeir who handed New York a lead in the 30th minute.\n\nInter Miami's first-half performance was lackluster which called upon Rojas' incoming for the second half. He made an impact just three minutes into the field as he collected a pass from Messi and evaded two defenders before unleashing a terrific drive from 25 yards behind.\n\nAs they say, Messi entering the scoresheet is inevitable, and Miami was 2-1 up when Rojas dispossessed Wikelman Carmona and found Suarez who set up the World Cup winner for a clinical finish. Messi set up another when while splitting the New York defense and providing a brilliant pass to Rojas who chipped over Carlos Coronel to score a brace.\n\nJust when the game was reaching the final moments, Luis Suarez entered the scoresheet netting a hat-trick, all with the help of Messi's setups. He first volleyed a chipped ball from Messi and minutes later played a passing game with Messi before striking the ball into the net and taking Miami 5-1 up. The sixth goal for Miami arrived when Suarez turned another Messi pass from close range with a tight angle.\n\nNew York, although scored a late penalty which was more of a consolatory goal as Emil Forsberg netted the second for NY Red Bulls. Inter Miami are table toppers with 24 points while the Red Bulls sit fourth with 17 points\n\nWith his five assists, Messi set a new MLS record for most assists in a game. Also, his six-goal involvements also set the record for most goal contributions in a single game.

Inter Miami will visit CF Montreal while the Red Bulls will host New England. ___ AP soccer:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Player_of_the_Month", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MLS Player of the Month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CF_Montr\u00e9al", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CF Montr\u00e9al"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emil Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Carmona", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Carmona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Alba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordi Alba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medicinehatnewslogo-square.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 967}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

There's nothing new going on, really. It's what fans of this sport have been seeing for years. When Messi takes the field, it often ends in pure, unfiltered domination. MLS is, as expected, no different.\n\nOn Saturday, Messi made it seven consecutive games with a goal and, if that wasn't enough, he added five assists for good measure. That brings him 10 goals and 12 assists already. He's played in just eight matches.\n\nSaturday's 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls was the eighth match of Messi's season, and it was probably the most impressive yet. Just a month ago, these same Red Bulls blasted a Messi-less Miami 4-0 at Red Bull Arena. With the Argentine in the XI this time around, Miami were never going to let that happen again, but the beating they put on this very good Red Bull team was unprecedented.\n\nMessi, of course, was the ringleader, but he wasn't alone. New signing Matias Rojas was fantastic, adding another layer to an Inter Miami team that already has plenty that can hurt you. Luis Suarez, too, was at his best, doing what he's always done: finish. Sergio Busquets ran the show, too, while the defense stood tall despite yet another early goal.\n\nIt all starts with Messi, though. When he's out there, Miami will always threaten to go nuclear. On Saturday, that's exactly what happened as Messi continued to destroy all in his path.", "source": {"uri": "goal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Goal.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_tolmich@goal.com", "name": "Ryan Tolmich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Busquets", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Busquets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt0f05c601040f9705/GOAL_-_Multiple_Images_-_3_Stacked_-_Facebook_(14).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

He referred to a few specific matches where Messi made a difference, including two against Valencia and Sevilla.\n\n\"Messi had exceptional games in Barcelona, during my time with him. But I also remember a semifinal with Paraguay in the Copa America in Chile, where he didn't score a goal and he was still the best player on the field.\n\n\"In Barcelona, he had a game against Valencia where we were losing 2-0 and then won 3-2 with three goals from him. And there was another against Sevilla where we were losing 1-0 and then he scored three goals and we won 4-1,\" Martino said (via GOAL).\n\nFurther, the former Argentina coach also pointed out how the Argentine talisman 'always does something new' in every game. Tata Martino has previously managed Lionel Messi in his former club, Barcelona in the 2013-14 season and the Argentina national team between 2014 and 2016.\n\n\"I always say this, and it's redundant at this point, but he always does something new. To have involvement in all six goals of a team's 6-2 is something that will be difficult to see again.\" Martino continued.\n\nLionel Messi was involved in all six goals Inter Miami scored in their clash against the New York Red Bulls, providing 5 assists and scoring one goal. La Pulga has 12 goals and 11 assists in 11 appearances across all competitions for the Herons this season.\n\nLionel Messi makes records as he provides 5 assists in Inter Miami's 6-2 win over New York Red Bulls\n\nAfter Saturday's match, Lionel Messi became the first player in the history of Major League Soccer to register five assists in a single match. He also became the player with the most goal contributions in one match in the MLS, being involved in all six goals the Herons scored in their clash against the Red Bulls.\n\nInter Miami were 0-1 down at half-time in their fixture against NY Red Bulls. However, things took a major paradigm shift in the second half as La Pulga decided to be the cheat code for the Herons once again.\n\nLionel Messi provided his first assist to Matias Rojas in the 48th minute and scored the next goal two minutes later in the 50th minute, giving Inter Miami the lead with 2-1.

Luis Suarez's hat-trick was relegated to a support act as Messi, who also scored a goal, continued his outstanding run of form for the Florida outfit on Saturday.\n\nNew York went ahead on the half-hour at Chase stadium through Dante Vanzeir, who thumped home a first-time effort after Wikelman Carmon's shot cannoned off the far post.\n\nMatias Rojas put Inter Miami on level terms by receiving Messi's pass before curling a 20-yard effort into the top-right corner, reports .\n\nRojas and Suarez then linked up before the latter's deft pass released Messi, who gave his side the lead by firing home from 12 yards.\n\nInter Miami extended their advantage just after the hour through the impressive Rojas, who ran onto Messi's sublime through ball and sent a delightful chip over the head of goalkeeper Carlos Coronel.\n\nThe almost telepathic understanding between Messi and Suarez was on display as the Uruguayan striker sent an acrobatic volley into the far corner after the Inter Miami captain's lofted cross.\n\nThe former Barcelona teammates were irrepressible, and they again exchanged a series of slick passes before Suarez stroked home his side's fifth goal.\n\nSuarez, who joined Inter Miami on a free transfer in January, added to New York's misery by running onto Messi's pass and rounding Coronel before threading home his third goal from the tightest of angles.\n\nThe visitors grabbed a late consolation goal when Emil Forsberg converted from the spot after Marcelo Weigandt's mistimed challenge on John Tolkin.\n\nThe result leaves Inter Miami three points clear of second-placed Cincinnati in the Eastern Conference standings while New York Red Bulls remain fourth with 17 points.\n\nMessi has now scored 12 goals and provided 11 assists in 11 games for Inter Miami this season while Suarez has 12 goals and seven assists in 15 outings.\n\nMartino hails Messi-Suarez double act\n\nInter Miami manager Gerardo Martino hailed the attacking partnership of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in the team's 6-2 home rout of New York Red Bulls on Saturday.\n\n\"Messi always makes the difference,\" Martino told a news conference after the match at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale. \"Today the partnership between him and Luis in the second half worked very well, like in old times. They really were very influential in the game.\"\n\nThe other player to impress for Inter Miami was Paraguayan midfielder Matias Rojas, who scored twice and also showed a remarkable understanding with Messi. \"The truth is that everyone had a phenomenal impact in the game, but Leo probably did something historic with five assists and a goal,\" Martino said.\n\n\"I always say the same thing: it is redundant to talk about him [Messi] because it seems like he always does something new. If something was missing it was this: having an impact on the six goals that a team scores. It's going to be difficult to see something like this again.\"\n\nDespite the emphatic nature of the win, Martino said his team had plenty of scope for improvement. \"I think that in the first half, we couldn't find the passes between the lines,\" he said. \"We couldn't advance on the outside either because of the way they were set up. We knew we had to take some more risks and move the ball with more authority, which we did in the second half,\" the Argentine coach added.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Martino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Martino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tolkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Tolkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emil Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/202405053156776.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Inter Miami is in first place in the Eastern Conference for a reason, and with Messi back in the lineup, the club has won three straight games.\n\nThe Red Bulls have been boosted this season by the play of new signing Emil Forsberg, and Dante Vanzier is beginning to show flashes of his Designated Player-level talent as well.\n\nThe Sporting News looks at the key details ahead of this game, including how to watch it worldwide, kickoff times and the latest lineup news.\n\nMORE: Stream every game of Matchweek 12 free on MLS Season Pass from Apple TV\n\nFans can watch Inter Miami vs. New York Red Bulls and every league match this season via MLS Season Pass from Apple TV.\n\nThis MLS match, along with every other game through the entirety of the 2024 regular season and postseason, will be available to stream around the globe on MLS Season Pass from Apple TV.

Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m., local time.\n\nHere's how that time translates across some of the major territories:\n\nCoach Gerardo Martino continues to navigate a lineup with no Jordi Alba as well as Federico Redondo and Diego Gomez. However, the club got a boost this week with Sergii Kryvtsov back in full training.\n\nInter Miami predicted XI (4-3-3, right to left): Callender (GK) -- Wiegandt, Aviles, Freire, Negri -- Gressel, Busquets, Ruiz -- Messi, Suarez, Taylor.\n\nInter Miami subs: TBC\n\nThe Red Bulls will be without centerback Noah Elie due to his straight red card last week. However, Andres Reyes is back from his red card suspension from mid-April and should start alongside Sean Nealis in central defense.\n\nNew York Red Bulls predicted XI (4-3-3, right to left): Coronel (GK) -- Nealis, Reyes, Nealis, Tolkin -- Amaya, Edelman, Carmona -- Forsberg, Vanzier, Morgan.\n\nNew York Red Bulls subs: TBC\n\nSince Messi returned to the starting lineup in mid-April, his team has won three straight games, scoring 10 goals total in that span. Messi has been responsible for scoring or assisting on eight of those goals, and incredible feat and proof of his jaw-dropping skill in front of goal. With Messi in the lineup, the Red Bulls' unbeaten run will likely come to an end.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It's not only Messi, they have a lot of big guys running around.\"\n\nJust last summer when the legendary Argentinian talisman made his Major League Soccer debut with Inter Miami against the Red Bulls in Harrison, NJ, the talk was understandably centered around the disbelief of playing against the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, who at the time was just eight months removed from winning the World Cup.\n\nIt showed during his 30 minutes on the pitch when he came on as a second-half sub. The Red Bulls were caught ball-watching, practically star-struck, as Messi received the ball in the middle of the box in the 89th minute. He threaded a pass to the right wing to Benjamin Cremaschi, who instantly played it back to the middle where Messi's unmarkable run found him all alone with nothing but an open net in front of him leaving Red Bulls keeper Carlos Coronel without a prayer.\n\nMore than eight months have passed since Inter Miami's 2-0 win over New York and with it comes a significantly different looking side.\n\n\"It's a big challenge for us,\" head coach Sandro Schwarz said on Thursday. \"Our preparation the whole week and our training session and our video meetings the whole week was that we are playing against Inter Miami. Not only against Messi.\"\n\nIn his first year as head coach, Schwarz has the Red Bulls -- who clawed their way into the postseason during the final week of the 2023 season -- in third place in the Eastern Conference 10 matches into this year. Lewis Morgan is healthy and scoring at will. Emil Forsberg is pulling the strings just as the savvy Bundesliga veteran was expected to when he signed in December. Vanzeir is hitting new heights in his second year with the club, which included four assists during a 4-0 win over a Messi-less Inter Miami on March 23.\n\nSaturday, however, provides a rematch between first-place Miami and the Red Bulls where Messi is healthy and expectedly clicking on all cylinders. He has scored in each of the last six MLS matches he has played in for nine goals in total including two in each of his last wo matches against Nashville and New England.\n\nAn imposing figure to line up against, obviously, especially when he has brought some of the other great European champions to Miami like Luis Suarez, Sergio Bousquets, and Jordi Alba. But this is something that has not sidetracking the Red Bulls during their preparations this week as it might have one year ago.\n\n\"I think the team is more relaxed,\" Vanzeir said on Thursday. \"We're not as surprised about the names that play there. We know their qualities in general and I think we're more mature and confident in ourselves. I think our focus is more on ourselves this week -- how we can make them hurt, how we can show our qualities.\"\n\nThat does not mean they have not spent significant time gameplanning for one of the greatest players the game has ever seen.\n\n\"It's a team with high quality, especially with Lionel Messi... so we have to defend very strong, very compact in our defense's line,\" Schwarz said. \"Our structure will be very important but it's necessary to have the confidence with the ball to find the solutions, to find the space... We know for sure [Messi] is a very important player for them, especially in their last third and in the half space with his left foot when he comes inside to the box, the cutbacks... it's an important topic for Saturday to defend against this issue but it's necessary that we have the confidence with the ball and not only to think about, 'OK, how do we defend against Messi?' because they have Suarez and [Robert] Taylor, a lot of good players.\"\n\nBetween Miami's embarrassment of attacking riches, they lead MLS with 26 goals scored this season. Only two other teams in the 29-team MLS has scored 20 or more times.\n\nThe Red Bulls are not one of them, but their 14 goals are tied for third most in the Eastern Conference while their 10 goals allowed is second-fewest. It is the byproduct of a possession-laden, pressing style of soccer bolstered by a stout defense -- and something they believe can derail the Miami machine this weekend.\n\n\"We're the strongest in our style of play,\" Vanzeir said. \"We know we can hurt a lot of teams and that's what we're going to do. At the end of the day, you give everything on that pitch in our style of play. If we win, great. If we lose they were just better. That's the kind of focus and confidence we have now.\"", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_pantorno@amny.com", "name": "Joe Pantorno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Cremaschi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Cremaschi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Morgan_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Morgan (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emil Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Alba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordi Alba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24105060642173.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-23", "textStart": 2109, "textEnd": 2117}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

That goal extended the Argentine's MLS goal streak to seven straight games, dating back to the 1-1 draw against the LA Galaxy way back in late February.\n\nHowever, it wasn't the goal that was the story of the match for Inter Miami and their 36-year-old superstar.\n\nAlongside his goal, Messi set an all-time MLS record by assisting five goals in one match, with Luis Suarez bagging a hat-trick and new signing Matias Rojas grabbing a brace.\n\nLionel Messi has exploded into the 2024 season with a bang, scoring in seven straight league games through April and May, while also leading the club into its first-ever continental appearance.\n\nWhile the CONCACAF Champions Cup journey ended in the quarterfinals at the hands of a quality Monterrey side, Inter Miami are in contention for the MLS title near the top of the Eastern Conference table.\n\nWhile Lionel Messi's goal-scoring ability is what makes him one of the greatest ever, his equally exquisite creativity adds massively to his superstar career.\n\nMessi set an MLS record for assists in a single league match by registering an incredible five assists in a 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls on May 4, and of course he scored the other goal himself.\n\nSomething to note: Major League Soccer gives credit for second assists, which are not recognized globally as assists, and therefore are not noted here. For example, Leo Afonso's goal against the Colorado Rapids on April 6 is logged as an assist to Messi by MLS, even tho he passed it to David Ruiz who then registered the final pass.\n\nLionel Messi is in contention for the MLS lead in both goals and assists thanks to a monstrous start to the 2024 season.\n\nThe only reason he isn't far-and-away in front of the leaderboard is his two-week injury layoff through April, otherwise he would be well in the clear.\n\nLionel Messi has not yet played any games for Argentina in 2024.\n\nThe World Cup winning star was injured for Argentina's only games in 2024 thus far, suffering a hamstring injury while with Inter Miami that kept him out of March friendlies against El Salvador and Costa Rica.\n\nShould he prove fit enough to take the field, he would return to national team duty in the summer, with Argentina set to contest friendlies against Ecuador and Guatemala in early July before beginning their 2024 Copa America title defense.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporters'_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supporters' Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LA Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.F._Monterrey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C.F.

(AP) -- Lionel Messi had a record setting night for Inter Miami.\n\nHe scored a goal and had five assists as Inter Miami trounced the New York Red Bulls 6-2 on Saturday night -- with the Argentine great and eight-time Ballon d'Or winner as the game's best player setting no fewer than three Major League Soccer records in the effort.\n\nThe six goal contributions, five assists and five assists in a half were all MLS records.\n\nMessi, who earned the MLS Player of the Month Award for April, has now scored and assisted in six consecutive league matches.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez had three goals and Matias Rojas scored twice as Inter Miami got six unanswered goals to come back from a 1-0 deficit at halftime. Messi and Su\u00e1rez now have a league-leading 10 goals each, helping keep Inter Miami (7-2-3, 24 points) atop the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe win extended Miami's unbeaten string to six. The streak began after a 4-0 loss at New York on April 20, in which Messi did not play because of an injury.\n\nMiami began the rout with Rojas' equalizer in the 48th minute. Messi centered a pass to Rojas whose left-footed shot landed under the crossbar.\n\nSu\u00e1rez then fed a charging Messi with a touch pass to beat New York goalkeeper Carlos Coronel with a shot from 15 yards.\n\nRojas made it 3-1 with his second goal in the 62nd minute on an assist from Messi.\n\nMessi then contributed on former Barcelona teammate Su\u00e1rez's first goal in the 69th minute.\n\nSu\u00e1rez also struck in the 75th and 81st minutes before the Red Bulls (4-2-5, 17 points) closed the scoring on Emil Forsberg's penalty kick in stoppage time.\n\nNew York controlled possession early and eventually capitalized on a Miami defensive breakdown that resulted on Dante Vanzeir's goal in the 30th minute. Jos\u00e9 Carmona ran deep into the right wing of the large area and blasted a shot that bounced off the far post. An unmarked Vanzeir retrieved the deflection and converted from 15 yards.\n\nMessi had his only scoring opportunity of the first half in the 24th minute, when Coronel stopped his shot from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nMessi's former Barcelona teammate Jordi Alba missed his third straight game because of a hamstring injury.\n\nBoth clubs will continue MLS play next Saturday. Inter Miami will visit CF Montreal while the Red Bulls will host New England.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It is some revenge for David Beckham's soccer team after the Red Bulls demolished Miami 4-0 in New Jersey in March.\n\nIt looked like history might repeat itself when Dante Vanzeir opened the scoring for the visitors on the half hour mark, with the Red Bulls taking a 1-0 lead into halftime. But whatever Tata Martino said at the interval had the desired effect.\n\nMatias Rojas levelled the score on minute 48 thanks to Messi, before the World Cup winner, thanks to link-up play with Suarez, then got one for himself to take the lead. From there, the floodgates opened.\n\nREAD MORE: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney unveil masterplan to lure Taylor Swift to Wrexham\n\nREAD MORE: Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez have already equalled record set by David Beckham and Landon Donovan\n\nRojas got a second, again thanks to Messi, before Suarez netted a hat-trick. And the same man got the assists for all those goals too. It meant Messi walked away from the fixture with five assists, a feat that has never been achieved before in Major League Soccer.\n\nThe Red Bulls did score a consolation goal through an Emil Forsberg penalty in the 97th minute but it did little undo the damage caused by Messi, Suarez and Rojas. The win keeps Miami at the top of the league, three points ahead of FC Cincinnati who have a game in hand.\n\nMessi has now scored 10 goals and produced nine assists in just eight MLS games this season. After a rocky star to the campaign with injury, there is no doubting the Argentinian is back to his best.\n\nLionel Messi and Luis Suarez ran riot against the New York Red Bulls\n\nSpeaking after the game, coach Martino was almost at a loss for words to sum up his star forward. \"Well, I always say the same thing, it is redundant to talk about him because he always seems to do something new,\" he said. \"And well, if something was missing, it was this. To have an impact on the six goals a team scores, this is going to be difficult to see again.\"\n\nReflecting on his team's achievements, he added: \"All of them had a phenomenal impact in the match. But well, Leo has probably done something historic, which is five assists, one goal in the league.\n\n\"I can't forget Luis' three goals, Mati\u0301as' two goals. The first one by Matias was good, both were great,\" Martino said when asked about his favorite score from the match. For the technical gesture and Leo's pass, I'll take Luis' scissors kick (in the 68th minute). That's the one for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_bristow@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Thomas Bristow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrexham_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrexham A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_McElhenney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob McElhenney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emil Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landon Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Martino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Martino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Cincinnati", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Cincinnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32738215.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2150487999.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Inter Miami CF were losing at home to New York Red Bulls as the teams came back out after the break. Forty-five minutes later and Lionel Messi had broken the MLS record for most goal contributions in a single match in a 6-2 victory.\n\nThe Argentine forward had already set up one goal for Mat\u00edas Rojas before he scored himself, and he then assisted another for Rojas and all three Luis Su\u00e1rez goals in spectacular fashion.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\nDante Vanzeir had opened the scoring for the Red Bulls, giving the Herons flashbacks of their dreadful first confrontation with New York this season when they lost 4-0 at the Red Bull Arena on March 23. Inter Miami had played through the International break and also missed several players through injury-induced absences.\n\nMessi missed the game with a hamstring injury, though he would have been away with Argentina if fit, watching from afar as Miami faced a difficult challenge.\n\nThe lack of offensive options forced Martino into a 5-3-2 lineup with Suarez and Leonardo Campana leading the attack. It only took the Red Bulls three minutes to score.\n\nVanzeir supplied Lewis Morgan with a through ball, inspiring the No. 9 to complete the right-footed strike from just outside the box into the lower left corner of the goal. Defender Tom\u00e1s Avil\u00e9s struggled.\n\nMorgan scored a hat trick, while Wikelman Carmona celebrated his first contribution of the season. The Herons concluded the night with seven shots, two on target, 70% possession and no goals. Miami was dumbfounded.\n\n\"There is not much to say, except that we were outmatched from start to finish,\" Martino said after that first meeting. \"When a team enters a game without the desire to win, without spirit, without competing, and the other side just wants to win the game, they are going to win it.\"\n\nSix weeks later, the first half gave the impression that the Red Bulls might just be Miami's kryptonite. Only this time around, Inter Miami boasted their not-so-secret weapon.\n\nAfter half-time, Messi returned to the pitch with vengeance. After just three minutes he quickly worked the ball on the right, finding a pocket of space to provide Rojas with the perfect pass to complete the left-footed strike.\n\nTwo minutes later, Messi found the back of the net himself with a shot into the net from the center of the box. The equalizer calmed Miami's nerves and frazzled the opponent. The rainstorm of goals persisted until Suarez completed his first MLS hat trick.\n\n\"It's easier with Leo,\" Suarez said. \"Obviously we know each other, and sometimes you'll notice we know where the other is and do movements without having to look at one another. It's good for the team.\".\n\nMessi and Su\u00e1rez now have a league-leading 10 goals each, and the Argentina star also leads MLS in assists with 12.\n\nHead coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino has been witness to many of Messi's phases, coaching him at Barcelona from 2013-14 and with Argentina from 2014 to 2016. He also faced the forward while coaching the Paraguayan and Mexican national teams.\n\nBut even after watching him for years, Martino emphasized the impactful performance against the Red Bulls will be difficult to witness again.\n\n\"Messi had exceptional games in Barcelona, during my time with him,\" Martino said. \"But I also remember a semifinal with Paraguay in the Copa America in Chile, where he didn't score a goal and he was still the best player on the field. In Barcelona, he had a game against Valencia where we were losing 2-0 and then won 3-2 with three goals from him.\n\n\"And there was another against Sevilla where we were losing 1-0 and then he scored three goals and we won 4-1. I always say this, and it's redundant at this point, but he always does something new. To have involvement in all six goals of a team's 6-2 is something that will be difficult to see again.\"\n\nAs so many predicted, Messi has become an integral part of Inter Miami's success.\n\n\"He's not the key component just because of this game,\" Martino concluded. \"He always is. Today, the association between Messi and Luis in the second half worked well, like old times. When they find each other, the team is able to back them up in the game, and when we find space, they are very influential in the game.\n\n\"There is a reason MLS has Designated Players, and he is ours. So, when he is missing, the team feels it.\"\n\nSince he made his debut in July 2023, Inter Miami is 2-4-6 (WDL) when he does not play and 15-7-3 when he is on the pitch across all competitions.",

Lionel Messi was at the heart of the rout, providing a record five assists and netting a goal himself as former Barcelona teammate, Luis Suarez, scored a hat-trick.\n\nAfter falling behind to Dante Vanzeir's opener for the Red Bulls, Inter trailed 1-0 at half-time. However, the introduction of a substitute, Matias Rojas, sparked an astonishing turnaround. Rojas equalised within three minutes of the restart before Messi put Inter 2-1 up. The Argentine maestro then teed up Rojas again as the Paraguayan made it 3-1.\n\nSuarez took over from there, volleying home from a Messi assist to make it 4-1. The Uruguayan striker then exchanged passes with Messi to poke home Inter's fifth. Messi's fifth assist created the sixth, with Suarez turning in from a tight angle. Emil Forsberg's late penalty was scant consolation for the Red Bulls.\n\n\"The partnership of him (Messi) and Luis (Suarez) in the second half worked very well, like in old times,\" said Inter coach Gerardo Martino. \"They were very influential in the game.\" For Suarez, Messi's performance came as no surprise: \"Obviously what we have seen today surprises people, because you don't see that in football. But as a teammate and someone who knows him, nothing surprises me about him.\"\n\nThe rampant victory saw Messi take his tallies to 10 goals and 12 assists in just eight MLS appearances this season. For 37-year-old Suarez, his hat-trick took his league tally to 10 goals in 11 games as the former Barcelona stars continue to shine in Miami.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jude_obafemi@thewillnews.com", "name": "Jude Obafemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emil Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Martino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Martino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 5}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

While questions still remain about their viability without the Argentine great, Tata Martino hopes his side won't have to answer those for much of this year.\n\nMessi leads MLS this year in goals and is tied for the lead in assists, and his efforts to carry Inter Miami on his back have the club first in the Eastern Conference with 21 points from 11 games, although they've played one more match than nearly everyone else.\n\nThe Red Bulls sit third in the East, four points behind Inter Miami with a game in hand, meaning they are right in the thick of the battle. They have fallen off the pace slightly thanks to two straight draws but have lost just one match all season, which keeps them firmly in the hunt.\n\nThe Sporting News is following the Inter Miami vs New York Red Bulls match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happen.\n\nMORE: See the full updated MLS top goal scorers list as Lionel Messi leads the Golden Boot rankings\n\nInter Miami (4-3-3, right to left): Callender (GK) -- Weigandt, Freire, Aviles, Alba -- D.

Nealis, Reyes, Tolkin -- Gjengaar, Edelman, Carmona, Forsberg -- Vanzeir, Morgan.\n\n2 hours to kickoff: Last weekend's games saw Lionel Messi overtake Cristiano Ronaldo in one stat category between the two in their ever-present career rivalry. Messi now has 723 non-penalty goals in his career, while Ronaldo has 721. Messi has also achieved his total in 161 fewer games, which tracks as he is two years younger.\n\nRonaldo has always been his team's penalty taker throughout his career for club and country, while Messi has had less success from the spot, so it makes sense that he would do more of his damage from other situations.\n\nThere are two big questions for Tata Martino ahead of this match regarding his squad's availability. First, Jordi Alba has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury, and the timeline for his return is still unclear. It's thought he could potentially be back here as he was held out last week largely due to the Gillette Stadium field surface being turf, but with this game at home he could return.\n\nAdditionally, Luis Suarez came off the bench against the New England Revolution last weekend, amidst a chronic knee issue that needs consistent management, so it remains to be seen whether he is fit enough to start this game or if he needs more care.\n\nOtherwise, Inter Miami are beginning to get healthier each week. Diego Gomez is down for another few weeks with an ankle injury, while Serhiy Kryvtsov remains absent with a hamstring injury and Federico Redondo is down with a knee problem. Otherwise, there's only the long-term absence of ACL victim Facundo Farias to worry about, and things look far more promising than they did a few weeks ago.\n\nInter Miami projected starting lineup (4-3-3): Callender (GK) -- Weigandt, Freire, Aviles, Alba -- D. Ruiz, Busquets, Gressel -- Messi, Suarez, Taylor.\n\nInter Miami subs (9): (Lineups released one hour prior to kickoff)\n\nThe New York Red Bulls will be without their most-used center-back Noah Elie who is suspended for his red card against the Whitecaps last weekend. Otherwise, the absentee list for the Supporters' Shield contenders is minimal.\n\nPeter Stroud is down for a few weeks due to an ankle injury. Besides that, it's just a few youngsters who dot the injury list, like Wake Forest draftee Roald Mitchell who has a knee issue to worry about that will keep him out until the summer, while academy products Serge Ngoma and Ronald Donkor are missing with minor issues.\n\nNY Red Bulls projected starting lineup (4-4-2): Coronel (GK) -- D.

Messi's six goal contributions for Miami means that he is the first player to exceed 1200 career goal contributions. Miami now sits at the top of the MLS table after Messi's stellar performance, with a trip to Montreal next on their agenda.\n\nLionel Messi created MLS history during Inter Miami's 6-2 victory against New York Red Bulls, as the Argentine ran the show during their comfortable win. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner assisted five of the goals and also got on the scoresheet himself.\n\nSince moving to America in 2023, Messi has continued to wow fans like he has done for Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Argentina over the years. Nearly securing a play-off place for Miami despite their dismal start to the 2023 season, he has been in fine form once again for the 2024 MLS term, weighing in with 10 goals before their match against New York Red Bulls.\n\nAnd he continued that form in their most recent match. New York took the lead on the half-hour mark through Dante Vanzeir, but Messi emerged for the second-half with steely determination. He assisted Matias Rojas just three minutes after half-time, before putting Miami in front with a goal of his own two minutes later.\n\nMessi's Incredible Assist for Miami's Third Goal Argentine's precise pass goes viral\n\nHowever, Messi then stole the show with an incredible assist for Miami's third of the night. Playing a reverse pass to Rojas just inside New York's half, he then received the ball back and slowed play down with his first touch.\n\nSpotting Rojas making a run into the box, the Argentine threaded through an eye-of-the-needle pass to find the second half substitute. The ball was inch-perfect, perfectly weighted for the midfielder, who made the most of the opportunity. Football fans who have watched Messi over the years will have seen him create some goals with incredible skill, a mazy dribble, or an exquisite pass over the years, but this is up there with his best work.\n\nMessi Creates History as he Bags Five Assists Argentine the first MLS player ever to assist five times in a game\n\nHowever, that was not the end of what proved to be a fantastic night for Messi. He would go on to assist Luis Suarez three times, ensuring that the Uruguayan bagged a hat-trick on the night against New York.\n\nHaving a hand in every goal for Miami, Messi's five goal creations meant that he became the first player in MLS history to chalk up five assists in a single game. Impressively, he managed them all in the second half, a testament to just how good he was on the night.\n\nBut there was wider significance too. Messi's six goal contributions took him beyond the 1200 mark, making him the first player to exceed the landmark. After the career he has had so far, his latest accomplishment only helps to solidify his status as one of the best footballers of all time.\n\nWhat Next For Inter Miami and Messi Win cements position at the top of MLS table\n\nMessi's incredible showing against New York means that Miami are clear at the top of the MLS table, three points ahead of Salt Lake and Cincinnati, who both have games in hand. With 32 goals scored so far, though, there are few teams in the division who can boast the firepower at their disposal.\n\nUp next following their resounding victory is a trip to Montreal on 12th May, with Messi and Co hoping to continue their fine form. The Canadian outfit are currently 20th in the division with just 12 points from 10 games, so Miami will be confident of yet another victory.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-05-may-2024-08-04-am-9941.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 3413, "textEnd": 3421}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It's good for the team,\" Su\u00e1rez said.\n\nMartino and Messi boast a long history together, coinciding at Barcelona and playing against each other while the Herons coach led the national teams of Paraguay and Mexico. Even with years of experience watching Messi, Martino maintains the forward's performance against the Red Bulls will be difficult to witness again.\n\n\"Messi had exceptional games in Barcelona, during my time with him,\" he said. \"But I also remember a semifinal with Paraguay in the Copa America in Chile, where he didn't score a goal and he was still the best player on the field. In Barcelona, he had a game against Valencia where we were losing 2-0 and then won 3-2 with three goals from him. And there was another against Sevilla where we were losing 1-0 and then he scored three goals and we won 4-1. I always say this, and it's redundant at this point, but he always does something new.

There's nothing new going on, really. It's what fans of this sport have been seeing for years. When Messi takes the field, it often ends in pure, unfiltered domination. MLS is, as expected, no different.\n\nOn Saturday, Messi made it seven consecutive games with a goal and, if that wasn't enough, he added five assists for good measure. That brings him 10 goals and 12 assists already. He's played in just eight matches.\n\nSaturday's 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls was the eighth match of Messi's season, and it was probably the most impressive yet. Just a month ago, these same Red Bulls blasted a Messi-less Miami 4-0 at Red Bull Arena. With the Argentine in the XI this time around, Miami were never going to let that happen again, but the beating they put on this very good Red Bull team was unprecedented.\n\nMessi, of course, was the ringleader, but he wasn't alone. New signing Matias Rojas was fantastic, adding another layer to an Inter Miami team that already has plenty that can hurt you. Luis Suarez, too, was at his best, doing what he's always done: finish. Sergio Busquets ran the show, too, while the defense stood tall despite yet another early goal.\n\nIt all starts with Messi, though. When he's out there, Miami will always threaten to go nuclear.

The streak began after a 4-0 loss at New York on April 20, in which Messi did not play because of an injury.\n\nMiami began the rout with Rojas' equalizer in the 48th minute.

Inter Miami beats Red Bulls, 6-2.", "body": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- This time, Lionel Messi was in the Inter Miami starting lineup against the New York Red Bulls and he made a massive difference.\n\nWith Miami trailing 1-0 at halftime on Saturday night, the Argentine captain delivered a goal and five assists (yes, five!) and led the team to an emphatic 6-2 victory. Newly signed Paraguayan midfielder Matias Rojas, a second-half sub, scored two goals. Luis Suarez got a hat trick over the span of 12 minutes. All of Miami's goals were scored after halftime.\n\nSix weeks ago, Inter Miami was trounced, 4-0, on the road to the Red Bulls for their worst loss of the season.\n\nWhen the teams met at Red Bulls Arena on March 23, the weather was horrid, Messi was out with a hamstring injury. Saturday was a completely different climate and result.\n\nMessi has scored 10 goals and recorded 12 assists over eight games so far this season, an MLS record. His six goal contributions on Saturday set a record for the most in a single game in MLS history. Messi's five assists were also the most by a player in a game in MLS history.\n\nMiami has not lost another league game since that defeat to New York and is riding a four-game win streak during which it has outscored opponents 16-6.\n\nMessi is a big reason for the turnaround and for the team's surge to the top of the Supporters Shield race with 24 points. On Tuesday was named MLS Player of the Month for April, and he continues to shine in May.\n\nHe was coming off a two-goal, one-assist performance in a 4-1 win over the New England Revolution in front of a historic crowd of 65,600 at Gillette Stadium.\n\nMiami is unbeaten over the past four league games and leads MLS with 32 goals. Third-place New York was unbeaten over six, led by Emil Forsberg and Morgan, who has seven goals and one assist in 10 games.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"We have recovered from a difficult, painful stretch,\" Martino said before the game Saturday. \"We aspired to be the Columbus of (Wednesday) night (the Crew beat Monterrey to advance to the Champions Cup final). We were unable to do that, but we regrouped with a road win at Kansas City and have had three wins now, including two on the road. That gives us strength. We are in a good stretch and want to keep it going.\"\n\nThe men in pink were determined to start strong on Saturday and avenge the loss to the Red Bulls.\n\n\"It's time for us to show them how good we really are,\" Taylor said. \"When we went there, we were not ourselves at all. Now it's redemption for us.\"\n\nThe rest of the Miami lineup Saturday was Drake Callender, Tomas Aviles, Nico Freire, Franco Negri, Sergio Busquets, Julian Gressel, David Ruiz, Marcelo Weigandt, Luis Suarez, and Robert Taylor. Callender, Freire, Negri, Ruiz, and Weigandt did not play in the game at New York.\n\nFormer Inter Miami player Lewis Morgan led the Red Bulls with a hat trick in their first meeting. He was held scoreless on Saturday.\n\n\"It was a poor game, we have analyzed it a lot, independent of the absences, and it was our worst match of the past year,\" said Inter Miami coach Tata Martino of the first matchup. \"We expect an equally intense game Saturday, they have all their players also available. It will be a good test for us.\"\n\nThey aced the test. And then some.\n\n\u00a92024 Miami Herald. Visit at miamiherald.com.

Explore his impact with Luis Su\u00e1rez in the MLS record-setting match.\n\nLionel Messi made Major League Soccer history with a stellar performance, setting records for goal contributions and assists in a single match during Inter Miami CF's impressive 6-2 victory over the New York Red Bulls at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nInter Miami coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino hailed Messi's remarkable feat, emphasizing the significance of his contributions to the team's triumph. \"All [goals] were fundamental to the game, but Leo did something historic tonight with five assists and one goal,\" Martino said.\n\nHowever, Martino also highlighted the stellar performances of Luis Su\u00e1rez and Mat\u00edas Rojas, who played pivotal roles in the victory. Su\u00e1rez netted a hat-trick, while Rojas scored twice, contributing to Inter Miami's stunning comeback from a 1-0 deficit at halftime.\n\nWith Messi and Su\u00e1rez leading the charge, Inter Miami's attack has become formidable. Both players have reached double figures in goals for the season, with Messi also leading the league in assists with 12.\n\nSu\u00e1rez praised the understanding and chemistry he shares with Messi on the pitch, attributing their success to their longstanding partnership. \"It's easier with Leo. Obviously, we know each other, and sometimes you'll notice we know where the other is and do movements without having to look at one another. It's good for the team,\" Su\u00e1rez said.\n\nMartino's Recognition of Messi's Brilliance\n\nMartino, who has a long history with Messi dating back to their time at Barcelona, expressed awe at Messi's performance against the Red Bulls. Reflecting on their past experiences together, Martino acknowledged Messi's ability to amaze with his talent and versatility constantly.\n\n\"Messi had exceptional games in Barcelona during my time with him,\" Martino recalled. \"But I always say this, and it's redundant at this point, but he always does something new. To have involvement in all six goals of a team's 6-2 is something that will be difficult to see again.\"\n\nMessi's Impact on Inter Miami's Success\n\nSince joining Inter Miami in July 2023, Messi has become a linchpin of the team's success. His presence on the pitch significantly influences the team's performance, as evidenced by their impressive record with him in the lineup.\n\nMartino emphasized Messi's indispensable role in the team, highlighting his influence on the pitch and his positive impact on his teammates. \"He's not the key component just because of this game. He always is,\" Martino said.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWith Messi leading the charge, Inter Miami continues to lead the Eastern Conference table with 24 points in 12 games.

From that point onwards, it was a goal fest.\n\nRojas bagged another goal, once again courtesy of Messi, before Suarez completed his hat-trick. Impressively, all these goals were assisted by Messi, marking a record-breaking performance in the MLS, reports the Mirror.\n\nDespite Emil Forsberg scoring a penalty for the Red Bulls in the 97th minute, it did little to mitigate the damage inflicted by the trio of Messi, Suarez and Rojas. The victory keeps Miami at the summit of the league, three points clear of FC Cincinnati, who have a game in hand.\n\nAfter a sluggish start due to injuries, Lionel Messi has now notched up 10 goals and provided 12 assists in just eight MLS matches this season proving he's back on top form. Martino, his coach, was left almost speechless when discussing the Argentine star's performance post-match. \"Well, I always say the same thing, it is redundant to talk about him because he always seems to do something new,\" he marvelled.\n\n\"And well, if something was missing, it was this. To have an impact on the six goals a team scores, this is going to be difficult to see again.\"\n\nReflecting further on his squad's accomplishment, Martino added: \"All of them had a phenomenal impact in the match. But well, Leo has probably done something historic, which is five assists, one goal in the league.\n\n\"I can't forget Luis' three goals, Matias' two goals. The first one by Matias was good, both were grea.\" When quizzed over his favourite goal from the game, he then declared: \"For the technical gesture and Leo's pass, I'll take Luis' scissors kick (in the 68th minute). That's the one for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_staplehurst@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Jack Staplehurst", "type":

Lionel Messi's goal against the New York Red Bulls brought his total up to 10 on the season. Ironically, he is joined at the top of that chart by teammate Luis Suarez, who secured a hat trick against New York on Saturday.\n\nYes, it is still early in the 2024 MLS season. Yet, there is a chance Lionel Messi will usurp that single-season scoring record in Major League Soccer. Currently, the high mark belongs to Carlos Vela. The Mexican scored 34 goals in the 2019 MLS Season, doing so in 31 MLS games with LAFC. After 12 games in that season, Vela had 13 goals, so he was ahead of the pace Messi is currently on. However, the Argentine has missed four games. Effectively, he is on just over a goal-per-game ratio. In terms of numbers, Messi is scoring 1.25 goals per game, while Vela's record-breaking season was 1.1 goals per game. That is a slim, arguably marginal difference. However, the pace would be enough for Messi to break the record, assuming he plays enough games.\n\nIn that lies the challenge for Messi and Inter Miami this season. There are no guarantees surrounding how many games Lionel Messi will play in the pink kit of the Florida club. There are several arguments that say as soon as Inter Miami clinches a playoff spot, it should begin to cut Messi's minutes to ensure he is fit for the playoffs. He has already missed four games this season. Officially, one of those was for rest, but the other three that followed were connected to ever-present muscular problems.\n\nBased on his current ratio, Messi would need to play in 28 MLS games to break Vela's record and score 35 goals in one MLS season. That assumes he can maintain this remarkable pace, too. It will likely simmer down, but Carlos Vela was a consistent goal-scorer throughout the 2019 MLS campaign. Based on his early success, health may be Messi's biggest opponent in regard to the record.\n\nIf Lionel Messi does not break the goal-scoring record in MLS, there is still the potential for other records for Messi. For example, he is already setting the standard in MLS for the future. Through eight games this season, Messi broke several records, some of which were single-game records.\n\nLooking back to the 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls, Messi set the single-game mark for both goal contributions and assists. His five-assist performance at the weekend was the most in MLS history. Combine those with his goal, and no other MLS player has contributed six goals in one game. It was also the sixth game in a row for Messi to amass multiple goal contributions. In his last four games, Messi has contributed 14 goals with the Argentine scoring six and assisting eight in that span.\n\nIn total, he has 22 goal contributions through eight games played in MLS. That is a record for eight games in MLS history, with Miami benefiting greatly. It leads the MLS Eastern Conference with 24 points through 12 games. Moreover, Miami is unbeaten when Messi plays in MLS this season.\n\nGoal contributions are hard to nail down. One assist may be far more impressive than another, much like some goals are penalties and some are world-class efforts. Regardless, MLS attributed five assists to Messi, and that put him atop the MLS assist chart. With 10 assists to go along with his 10 goals, Messi is on track to break the single-season assist record, too. Carlos Valderrama holds that record with 26 assists in 2000.

Instead, it is once again Lionel Messi dominating headlines courtesy of a performance which almost defied belief.\n\nIn a 6-2 victory over the New York Red Bulls, Messi broke two MLS records. \"I don't think we will ever see anything like that again,\" said Miami's head coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino, per the MLS.\n\nThe World Cup-winning Argentine became the first player in the league to make five assists in a single game, while his goal and assists made his six-goal contribution at Chase Stadium the most in a single game in the league's history.\n\nLast week, in Miami's victory over New England Revolution, Messi had set two other MLS records.\n\nHe has now scored and assisted in six consecutive league matches, taking his goal tally for the season to 10 in eight games - equal with Su\u00e1rez. No other player in the MLS has contributed more assists this season than Messi's 12.\n\nMessi and Su\u00e1rez formed a formidable partnership while at Barcelona and the pair have seamlessly transferred that understanding onto the pitch when playing for Miami.\n\nMiami went into half-time 1-0 down, with Dante Vanzeir putting New York ahead in the 30th minute. But after the break, substitute Mat\u00edas Rojas leveled in the 48th minute after being put through by Messi.\n\nMessi then put his team 2-1 ahead before turning provider for Su\u00e1rez on three occasions and again for new signing Rojas, who ended the match with two goals. Emil Forsberg scored in the 97th minute for a consolation goal.\n\nMiami remains top of the Eastern Conference and next plays CF Montreal on May 11.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

They were very influential in the game,\" said Martino.\n\nNew York had a late consolation in the final seconds with a penalty from Forsberg.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikelman_Carmona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wikelman Carmona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emil Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Carmona", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Carmona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Martino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Martino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/05/429347-messi-magic-hits-mls-as-inter-miami-crush-new-york-red-bulls-in-marathon-win.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Lionel Messi scored a goal and had five assists as Inter Miami trounced the New York Red Bulls 6-2 on Saturday night.\n\nMessi, who earned the MLS Player of the Month Award for April, has now scored and assisted in six consecutive league matches.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez had three goals and Matias Rojas scored twice as Inter Miami got six unanswered goals to come back from a 1-0 deficit at halftime. Messi and Su\u00e1rez now have a league-leading 10 goals each, helping keep Inter Miami (7-2-3, 24 points) atop the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe win extended Miami's unbeaten string to six. The streak began after a 4-0 loss at New York on April 20, in which Messi did not play because of an injury.\n\nMiami began the rout with Rojas' equalizer in the 48th minute. Messi centered a pass to Rojas whose left-footed shot landed under the crossbar.\n\nSu\u00e1rez then fed a charging Messi with a touch pass to beat New York goalkeeper Carlos Coronel with a shot from 15 yards.\n\nRojas made it 3-1 with his second goal in the 62nd minute on an assist from Messi.\n\nMessi then contributed on former Barcelona teammate Su\u00e1rez's first goal in the 69th minute.\n\nSu\u00e1rez also struck in the 75th and 81st minutes before the Red Bulls (4-2-5, 17 points) closed the scoring on Emil Forsberg's penalty kick in stoppage time.\n\nNew York controlled possession early and eventually capitalized on a Miami defensive breakdown that resulted on Dante Vanzeir's goal in the 30th minute. Jos\u00e9 Carmona ran deep into the right wing of the large area and blasted a shot that bounced off the far post. An unmarked Vanzeir retrieved the deflection and converted from 15 yards.\n\nMessi had his only scoring opportunity of the first half in the 24th minute, when Coronel stopped his shot from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nMessi's former Barcelona teammate Jordi Alba missed his third straight game because of a hamstring injury.\n\nBoth clubs will continue MLS play next Saturday. Inter Miami will visit CF Montreal while the Red Bulls will host New England.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Messi led Major League Soccer (MLS) with 10 goal contributions (six goals, four assists) during April in the MLS 2024 season. He did so in just four matches. For his mega performance, La Pulga was voted as the Player of the Month April 2024. This is Messi's first 'Player of the Month' award in MLS. Messi's six goals were the most in MLS while leading an Inter Miami squad that finished the month with a 3-0-1 record.

By the 81-minute mark, Messi had scored a goal and assisted five others.\n\nThe five assists were a single-game MLS record. The six goal contributions were a single-game MLS record. Both were also the most that Messi had registered in a single game throughout his glittering, unrivaled career.\n\nAnd he did it all in a single half -- in less than 34 minutes, to be precise.\n\nHis first assist was a relatively light lift. Inter Miami's newest signing, Mat\u00edas Rojas, took a Messi pass, beat a Red Bull, and picked out the top corner from\n\nBut his second assist was devilish:\n\nHis fourth was ridiculous, a testament to both his brilliance and the inferiority of his opponents.\n\nThe Red Bulls gifted him time and space throughout the second half. In the 75th minute, he beat an entire midfield line with a single cut, then played a one-two-three with Luis Suarez at the top of the box to create Suarez's second goal of the night.\n\nMessi also assisted Suarez's first, some eight minutes earlier.\n\nAnd roughly five minutes after the second, Suarez exploited an out-of-sync defensive line again. Messi found him, Suarez rounded a hapless goalkeeper, and Inter Miami extended its lead to 6-1.\n\nOh, and Messi had also scored a goal in amongst the five assists. He and Suarez pounced on a Red Bulls giveaway in the defensive third. Each only needed one touch.\n\nThe six goal contributions brought Messi to an absurd 22 on the season -- in seven-and-a-half MLS games. That's nearly three goal contributions per 90 minutes.\n\nHe is nearly halfway to both the single-season MLS assist record and the goal-plus-assist record -- in early May, and despite missing four games due to rest or injury.\n\nHe may not re-write every line in the league's record book, because he'll step away for a month beginning in June for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica. But he is ripping up the league at rates never before seen.\n\nHe is also creating goals at unprecedented rates even for him, even at age 36 going on 37.\n\nMLS statisticians are generous with their awarding of assists, but even if you go by the global definition, Messi is now at 2.53 non-penalty goals plus assists per 90 minutes, on pace to shatter his personal single-season record of 1.80, set at Barcelona in La Liga in 2012-13.\n\nNeedless to say, he leads MLS in both goals and assists, despite missing those few games. And Inter Miami stands atop the Eastern Conference.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Florida Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat\u00edas_Rojas_(footballer,_born_1995)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mat\u00edas Rojas (footballer, born 1995)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9Hx2hhFvaCX7RXyiOqv4GQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/4d424340-0a7e-11ef-aeca-2f78781da855", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Despite trailing 1-0 at halftime to a spirited goal by Dante Vanzeir, Inter Miami emerged from the break transformed, with Messi at the heart of an electrifying comeback.\n\nScoring once and assisting five times, Messi set two MLS records in one game: the most goal contributions in a single match with six, and the most assists in a single match with five. This was a performance that reverberated across the soccer world, showcasing not only his unmatchable skill but also his profound impact on his team and the league.\n\nSuarez, reaping the rewards of Messi's visionary play, completed a hat-trick, while newcomer Matias Rojas scored twice off the bench, marking his debut with the club in style. The game, which ended with Inter Miami at the top of theEastern Conference standings, was a testament to the team's depth and resilience, having now gained 17 of their 24 points from trailing positions.\n\nThe magnitude of the victory was not lost on the fans nor the pundits, as Messi was named Man of the Match in what could only be described as a masterclass of soccer intelligence and execution. His performance was a poignant reminder of why he remains one of the greatest, if not the greatest, to ever play the game.\n\nInter Miami's coach, reflecting on the historic win, praised the team's spirit and Messi's leadership. \"What we saw tonight was more than just a soccer game. It was a statement. Lionel doesn't just play; he inspires.\"\n\nAs the MLS season progresses, the eyes of the soccer world will remain fixed on Messi and Inter Miami, a team that now not only dreams of championship glory but also plays with the conviction of champions.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/543331896b6596225b2ec1153ba5fc80/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/05/17148752109304.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

OUR MLS picks expect the Red Bulls to strike, and strike fast,\n\nTwo of the biggest stars in MLS will meet on Saturday when Inter Miami hosts New York Red Bulls at Chase Stadium.\n\nMy Inter Miami vs. New York Red Bulls predictions are backing NYRB to find the back of the net against Miami early in what should be an exciting match.\n\nInter Miami's enjoying a three-match win streak, but they've not made things easy for themselves. In fact, they've had to dig out of a hole each time.\n\nTomas Chancalay's first-minute strike for New England last weekend proved to be nothing more than consolation in a 4-1 win for Inter Miami, but it was the third match running that Miami trailed inside of six minutes.\n\nWhile they haven't always trailed early this season, conceding in the first half has been an issue for Inter Miami. And it hasn't mattered if they have a full-strength squad or are heavily rotated or whether they're playing in front of friendly fans or not. They've now seen their defenses breached before the referee blew for halftime in eight consecutive matches.\n\nI'm betting on the New York Red Bulls to run that streak to nine straight matches when the teams meet on Saturday. The Red Bulls have lost just once in their six away matches this season. They've also found the back of the net in the first 45 in four of their last five road fixtures.\n\nIn fact, they've had better first-half results away from home so far in 2024, with just three 1H tallies in six matches.\n\nRed Bulls put four past Miami at home earlier this season, with Lewis Morgan opening the scoring just three minutes into proceedings. Morgan would add a second just minutes after half, opening the floodgates as the Herons were humiliated with Messi relegated to watching from the sidelines.\n\nThe Red Bulls have changed their tactics from last year, shifting from a team with a pressing high line to a side that is more dangerous on the counter-attack with Emil Forsberg pulling the strings. That's one of Miami's biggest weaknesses and a big reason why they continue to concede early.\n\nWith Miami likely pressing as they seek some revenge combined with the absence of Jordi Alba through injury, I'll happily bet on another first-half goal for NYRB with +124 odds on the table.\n\nThere's wide variance on Messi player props, so make sure you shop around. He's priced between -120 and -155 to score anytime, with multiple goals priced between +330 and +380.\n\nIt's a similar story with shots.

In Barcelona, he had a game against Valencia where we were losing 2-0 and then won 3-2 with three goals from him. And there was another against Sevilla where we were losing 1-0 and then he scored three goals and we won 4-1. I always say this, and it's redundant at this point, but he always does something new. To have involvement in all six goals of a team's 6-2 is something that will be difficult to see again.\"\n\nMessi has quickly become an integral part of Inter Miami's success.

Even though Miami conceded the first goal of the match for the fourth straight game, Messi and Co. clearly weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fazed as their second-half frenzy saw them score six goals in front of their fans \u00e2\u20ac\" as Messi was involved in all six of his team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals.\u00c2\n\n\u00c2 Messi provided the assists for new signing Matias Rojas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first two goals as a Miami player, while he also combined with his former Barcelona teammate Luis Suarez to aid his best friend's first hat trick as a Heron.\n\nAs Messi continued to dish out assists left and right, he also set a new MLS record as his five assists tallied are now the most-ever in a single league match. Messi now leads the league in both goals and assists with 10 and 10, respectively, and he doesn't look like slowing down anytime soon -- even with Copa America on the horizon.\n\nIf Messi wasn't the MVP frontrunner before tonight, there's simply no way he isn't after 12 matches played. The 36-year-old was essentially toying with the Red Bull defense for most of the match and probably could have grabbed another assist or two if Miami didn't go through such a sluggish start.\n\nSuarez has bagged two braces already for Miami against Orlando City and DC United earlier on in the campaign, but he finally managed a hat trick in a revenge game vs New York. Indeed, Suarez was in the starting lineup for Miami's heavy 4-0 defeat on March 23 when Messi was unavailable due to a hamstring injury.\n\nThe Uruguayan proved that he still has some left in the tank to get it done against one of the better MLS defenses. For context, New York had conceded more than two goals just once prior to the match -- a 3-0 defeat to current MLS Cup winners Columbus Crew.\n\nNot only did Suarez display elite composure and finishing in front of goal, but his movement and hold-up play also wasn't too shabby, either.\n\nMessi and Suarez are now joint-top of the MLS Golden Boot standings with 10 goals apiece, and it'll be tough for anyone to stop should them from racking up even more goals should they steer clear of injuries.\n\nThe iconic duo of Suarez and Messi no doubt put in their best performances as a Heron thus far and will be eager to continue on the same path before the upcoming Copa America tournament in the United States.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Crew_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Crew SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_City_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando City SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLS Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

Like some of the top Saudi sides, Miami look like they are building a team to be competitive at continental championships. Whilst at this rate domestic success will be guaranteed.\n\nEvery single Miami goal on the night came from South America. Messi got one, Mat\u00edas Rojas of Paraguay got two, and Luis Su\u00e1rez of Uruguay bagged a hat-trick.\n\nMessi mainly acted as provider on a humid evening in the sunshine state, where the flamingoes of Inter were truly peacocking. Their start-studded squad look capable of rolling over any other side in this league.\n\nAll six strikes from Miami came between the 48th and 81st minute after they had been 1-0 down at the half. Some of the play looked like men against boys. Take Luis Su\u00e1rez's second strike for example; the forward latched onto the ball and then breezed past the centre back like he didn't exist, when he really ought to have been challenged. As the game went on the goals became easier to find.\n\nMat\u00edas Rojas is a new recruit and part of the fabulous Lionel Messi support act, but he has tonnes of talent himself and is already showing he is a cut obove most of his other teammates. Rojas' left boot already has a reputation in South America; with the likes of Racing Club in Argentina Rojas would often score stunning strikes from that side.\n\nLast night that happened again, he scored a fantastic long-range effort, and another clever scoop over the keeper that he collected from a trademark Lionel Messi assist. A through ball executed expertly that many others wouldn't even think to attempt. Rojas recently arrived from Corinthians of Brazil, he had a short stint there after a successful period in Argentina. For a talent like him the MLS will, with respect, be a piece of cake. Technically speaking, he is a sensational talent.\n\nMessi's own strike came courtesy of his teammate and best friend Suarez sliding him into the box to finish with relative ease. These guys are playing with a freedom that they deserve. Both now veterans at the end of hugely successful careers, they have also been seen out and about in Miami enjoying downtime with their families. Something that wasn't so easy to achieve in Europe alongside their superstar status.\n\nWith that being said, the Copa America is now just over a month away and some of this Inter Miami squad will be there representing their respective nations. Lionel Messi is still the captain of Argentina and his country are favourites to lift the title in the U.S this summer. Miami and the MLS can wait for a while, as Messi chases more international glory with the World Cup champions.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat\u00edas_Rojas_(footballer,_born_1995)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mat\u00edas Rojas (footballer, born 1995)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Club_de_Avellaneda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing Club de Avellaneda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_Club_Corinthians_Paulista", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport Club Corinthians Paulista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663740451e991d66e1312ad4/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

To have involvement in all six goals of a team's 6-2 is something that will be difficult to see again.\"", "source": {"uri": "snl24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Soccer Laduma"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Martino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Martino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Osimhen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Osimhen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valencia CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8094/62becd2293c44cbcaa54852ce3c52efe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Emil Forsberg sliced the Miami defense in half with an exquisite outside-of-the-foot pass into Wikelman Carmona's path. Carmona's effort was kept out by Callender at first, but Dante Vanzeir's follow-up shot from around the penalty spot gave New York the lead.\n\nIn the first half, the Herons tiptoed around the New York penalty area and found themselves in good shooting positions but took too long to pull the trigger. That changed at the start of the second 45 when Matias Rojas was substituted on for David Ruiz.\n\nThe legendary Messi was barreling down the right-wing before he cut inside on his favored left foot to find Rojas, who danced past a couple of Red Bulls defenders and blasted a shot into the far-right corner past Carlos Coronel to score his first goal as a Miami player.\n\nThe hosts then turned the game on its head just a couple of minutes later after a turnover by Red Bulls. Rojas was involved yet again, as his pressing helped turn the ball over near the Red Bulls' penalty area into Luis Suarez's path. Suarez looked up to find his best friend Messi and played the Argentine through on goal, and Miami's No. 10 scored his 10th goal of the 2024 MLS season to put Miami in front for the first time in the game.\n\nMiami went on to find their third goal of the night with Messi linking up Rojas once more. Messi played the former Corinthians player through on goal with a clever pass that fooled everyone on the pitch other than Rojas, who chipped Coronel with ease to secure his brace.\n\nGerardo \"Tata\" Martino's side just couldn't be stopped as Messi grabbed his third assist of the night to make it 4-1 in favor of the Herons. The former Barcelona and PSG figure teed up an inviting cross that Suarez latched on to to increase the hosts' advantage.\n\nSuarez decided that he wanted to grab another goal as he and Messi raced forward at the tired Red Bull defense. Messi combined with Suarez for a quick-one-two and the Uruguayan made no mistake in front of goal.\n\nThe ex-Atletico Madrid player capped off his hat trick with a delicate finish from a tight angle to make it 6-1 for Miami. It was once again the Messi-Suarez connection that Red Bulls fans will probably have come to despise after watching the game. Messi combined with Suarez with a simple outside-of-the-foot pass to send the Liverpool icon through on goal to set a new record for assists in an MLS match with five helpers.\n\nEmil Forsberg managed to pull one back in stoppage time for New York after Marcelo \"Chelo\" Weigandt stepped on John Tolkin's left foot in his own penalty area. The former RB Leipzig player converted the penalty with ease but it was of course too little, too late as the game ended 6-2 in favor of the Herons.\n\nThe resounding victory saw Miami gain a foothold on the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Martino's side have now collected 24 points from 12 matches played, while New York drop to fourth place in the division with 17 points from 11 matches played.\n\nGK: Drake Callender - 6/10 - The lone goal conceded wasn't his fault entirely as he did\n\nmanage to keep out Carmona's effort and he can't help that Freire decided to assist Aviles in\n\nmarking the same player leading up to the goal.\n\nRB: Marcelo Weigandt - 5/10 - Struggled defensively in the first half but managed to turn\n\nthings around after the halftime break. Ended the night in poor fashion with a clumsy challenge\n\nin stoppage time that resulted in a converted penalty for Red Bulls.\n\nCB: Tomas Aviles - 7/10 - One of Miami's best performers on the night as he kept them in the\n\ncontest with several last-ditch tackles and challenges.\n\nCB: Nicolas Freire - 6/10 - Was pulled way out of position for New York's opening goal.\n\nLB: Franco Negri - 6/10 - A quiet night overall from the veteran full-back.\n\nCM: Julian Gressel - 6/10 - Showed off his impressive passing range here and there but\n\nnothing much to write home about.\n\nCM: Sergio Busquets - 8/10 - Another timeless performance from the veteran midfielder\n\nagainst the dynamic pairing of Frankie Amaya and Daniel Edelman.\n\nCM: David Ruiz - 7/10 - Displayed great anticipation with a few well-timed challenges in the first\n\nhalf. Unfortunate to be hooked for Rojas at the start of the second half.\n\nRW: Lionel Messi - 10/10 - Perhaps his best showing in a Miami shirt even though he only\n\nmanaged to find the back of the net once. His five assists set a new record for most in an MLS\n\nmatch and he'll no doubt be the MVP frontrunner after this week's matches - if he already\n\nwasn't the frontrunner, that is.\n\nST: Luis Suarez - 9/10 - A clinical outing from the legendary forward as he bagged his first hat\n\ntrick as a Heron.\n\nLW: Robert Taylor - 7/10 - Had a few nice moments here and there in the attack as he\n\ncontinues to regain sharpness\n\nSUB: Matias Rohas (46' for Ruiz) - 9/10 - Came on and instantly changed the game with a\n\nperfect strike from distance to level the score.\n\nSUB: Benjamin Cremaschi (66' for Taylor) - 7/10 - Played his part in setting up Suarez's first\n\ngoal of the night.\n\nSUB: Yannick Bright (66' for Gressel) - 6/10 - The player neither helped nor hindered his\n\nside.\n\nSUB: Leo Campana (84' for Suarez) - N/A\n\nSUB: Noah Allen (84' for Negri) - N/A\n\nGerardo 'Tata' Martino - 9/10 - A slow start occurred once again for his team, but that clearly\n\ndidn't affect them as they went on to put six past Coronel. His decision to bring on Rojas was a\n\nmasterstroke, and Miami continue to look like the best team in MLS and are capable of flipping\n\nthe switch in a moment's notice to go all-out in attack.",

The Herons have seen 42 goals fly in over the course of the 11 MLS games they've played - conceding has also been a frequent occurance too.\n\nIt might not be so easy against a NYRB side who have kept things a little tighter, but the opportunity to hit Miami on the counter could see the game open up pretty quickly.

Making the playoffs is the first and foremost objective for every Major League Soccer team before the season begins. Looking at it objectively, it isn't very challenging. After all, more than half of the league makes it to the next phase.\n\nAnd then there are the ancillary objectives, such as off-field projects, prizes, and transfers. On the other hand, once the new year begins and every club begins its preseason training, the playoffs become the first objective.\n\nThat is where Inter Miami was unsuccessful last season. They failed to make the playoffs last year after almost making it in 2022. The Herons were out in the cold with only two games remaining.\n\nThere was just no room in the screenplay for Lionel Messi to participate in the celebrations. Nobody could help Inter Miami escape the hole they had dug for themselves; not even the Argentine veteran could. Looking on as Messi attempted to save Miami in the MLS Playoffs would have been an incredible spectacle.\n\nHow has Miami fared so far this season?\n\nLast season did not live up to expectations, but who knows -- 2024 may be their breakout year! So, to get into the MLS Cup playoffs, how many more points must Inter Miami accumulate?\n\nWhat is the minimum number of points required to be eligible for the MLS Cup Playoffs? Will they be able to coast for the remainder of the season to give Lionel Messi and the rest of the team a break before Copa America?\n\nEven before Messi came in, the Herons had already retreated to the bottom of the standings. But they have since shown that they can at least attempt to compete with the greatest in Major League Soccer.\n\nWith 11 games under their belts, Tata Martino's side has a commanding lead in the Eastern Conference. Six victories, three ties, and two losses give them 21 points.\n\nNot far behind them comes a caravan of rivals, with Cincinnati, in second place, trailing by just three points. Next in line are the New York Red Bulls, Toronto, Columbus Crew, New York City FC, and Philadelphia Union, all of whom are separated by only one point.\n\nBut the Miami team has also had its share of challenges this year. For four MLS games, they were without their star player, Lionel Messi, and they came out on top only once.\n\nHow many more points does Miami need to reach the Playoffs?\n\nFor the rest of the season, they will be crossing their fingers that the 36-year-old stays healthy and gets plenty of rest. Especially considering that the regular season is far from over with 23 games yet to play.\n\nWith 23 games to go, they'll probably need a point per game to advance. The data from the previous season suggests as much. In 2023, Charlotte FC and the New York Red Bulls narrowly clinched the two Wild Card spots in the Eastern Conference with just 43 points each.\n\nThe wild-card round currently includes the eighth and ninth-place teams from each conference, according to a change in the tournament structure last season. Following that, the victor will go on to Round One to take on the top-ranked team.\n\nAt the same time, Nashville finished the previous season with 49 points, good enough for seventh place and the last Playoff slot. Based on that reasoning, for Miami to finish ninth and earn the Wild Card or seventh and guarantee themselves a berth in the Playoffs, they will need an additional 20-30 points.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martina_alcheva@worldsoccertalk.com", "name": "Martina Alcheva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Cup_Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MLS Cup Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Crew_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Crew SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240503_WST_504942_Messi-MLS-Cup-playoffs-1.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

To make matters worse, it was a former Inter Miami player, Lewis Morgan, who led the Red Bulls with a hat trick.\n\n\"It was a poor game, we have analyzed it a lot, independent of the absences, and it was our worst match of the past year,\" said Inter Miami coach Tata Martino. \"We expect an equally intense game Saturday, they have all their players also available. It will be a good test for us.\"\n\nMiami has not lost a league game since that defeat and is riding a three-game win streak during which it outscored opponents 10-4.\n\nMessi is a big reason for the turnaround and for the team's surge to the top of the Supporters Shield race with 26 points. The Argentine scored five goals over the past three games and added three assists. He has a league-high nine goals with seven assists over seven games and on Tuesday was named MLS Player of the Month for April.\n\nHe is coming off a two-goal, one-assist performance in a 4-1 win over the New England Revolution in front of a historic crowd of 65,600 at Gillette Stadium.\n\nHe shifted at times from the traditional No. 10 playmaker spot to more of a No. 9 striker position. Martino said Messi may be employed in different spots as the season progresses.\n\n\"To have Leo in those spaces is good news for us so he doesn't have to expend so much energy...it's not that he can't do it, he is moving well on any part of the field, but we should not deny that in addition to being the best soccer player in the world who creates goals, he's also a great finisher, \"Martino said. \"So, we have to find places for him in different facets of the game.\"\n\nInter Miami has also been strengthened by the return of Benjamin Cremaschi, Robert Taylor and Leo Campana, all of whom missed significant time with injuries.\n\nCremaschi, the Key Biscayne teen, missed the first eight games of the season after sports hernia surgery, but showed no signs of rust upon his return. The energetic midfielder scored against New England shortly after coming on as a sub for Julian Gressel in the 75 minute. Cremaschi will push Gressel for the starting job.\n\nDiego Gomez, Fede Redondo, and Jordi Alba are still out injured. Sergiy Kryvtsov is back.\n\nMiami is unbeaten during the past four league games. Third-place New York is unbeaten over six, led by Emil Forsberg and Morgan, who has seven goals and one assist in 10 games.\n\n\"We have recovered from a difficult, painful stretch,\" Martino said. \"We aspired to be the Columbus of (Wednesday) night (the Crew beat Monterrey to advance to the Champions Cup final). We were unable to do that, but we regrouped with a road win at Kansas City and have had three wins now, including two on the road. That gives us strength. We are in a good stretch and want to keep it going.\"\n\nThe only glaring problem has been conceding early goals. In the past three games Miami allowed goals in the sixth minute, second minute and first minute.\n\n\"We talk about that every week, in our coaches' meetings, one minute before going on the field, and they keep doing it to us the same way,\" Martino said. \"That's the bad part. The good part is we know how to turn things around, not panic, and keep looking for goals. But it is a topic we are trying to resolve, we talk about it extremely often, but until now we have not found the solution.\"\n\nThe men in pink are determined to start strong on Saturday and avenge the loss to the Red Bulls.\n\n\"It's time for us to show them how good we really are,\" Taylor said. \"When we went there, we were not ourselves at all. Now it's redemption for us.\"\n\nHow to Watch:\n\nInter Miami vs. New York Red Bulls kicks off at 7:30 p.m. at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale. The game will be shown for free on Apple TV.

Emil Forsberg sliced the Miami defense in half with an exquisite outside-of-the-foot pass into Wikelman Carmona's path. Carmona's effort was kept out by Callender at first, but Dante Vanzeir's follow-up shot from around the penalty spot gave New York the lead.\n\nIn the first half, the Herons tiptoed around the New York penalty area and found themselves in good shooting positions but took too long to pull the trigger. That changed at the start of the second 45 when Matias Rojas was substituted on for David Ruiz.\n\nThe legendary Messi was barreling down the right-wing before he cut inside on his favored left foot to find Rojas, who danced past a couple of Red Bulls defenders and blasted a shot into the far-right corner past Carlos Coronel to score his first goal as a Miami player.\n\nThe hosts then turned the game on its head just a couple of minutes later after a turnover by Red Bulls. Rojas was involved yet again, as his pressing helped turn the ball over near the Red Bulls' penalty area into Luis Suarez's path. Suarez looked up to find his best friend Messi and played the Argentine through on goal, and Miami's No. 10 scored his 10th goal of the 2024 MLS season to put Miami in front for the first time in the game.\n\nMiami went on to find their third goal of the night with Messi linking up Rojas once more. Messi played the former Corinthians player through on goal with a clever pass that fooled everyone on the pitch other than Rojas, who chipped Coronel with ease to secure his brace.\n\nGerardo \"Tata\" Martino's side just couldn't be stopped as Messi grabbed his third assist of the night to make it 4-1 in favor of the Herons. The former Barcelona and PSG figure teed up an inviting cross that Suarez latched on to to increase the hosts' advantage.\n\nSuarez decided that he wanted to grab another goal as he and Messi raced forward at the tired Red Bull defense. Messi combined with Suarez for a quick-one-two and the Uruguayan made no mistake in front of goal.\n\nThe ex-Atletico Madrid player capped off his hat trick with a delicate finish from a tight angle to make it 6-1 for Miami. It was once again the Messi-Suarez connection that Red Bulls fans will probably have come to despise after watching the game. Messi combined with Suarez with a simple outside-of-the-foot pass to send the Liverpool icon through on goal to set a new record for assists in an MLS match with five helpers.\n\nEmil Forsberg managed to pull one back in stoppage time for New York after Marcelo \"Chelo\" Weigandt stepped on John Tolkin's left foot in his own penalty area. The former RB Leipzig player converted the penalty with ease but it was of course too little, too late as the game ended 6-2 in favor of the Herons.\n\nThe resounding victory saw Miami gain a foothold on the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Martino's side have now collected 24 points from 12 matches played, while New York drop to fourth place in the division with 17 points from 11 matches played.\n\nGK: Drake Callender - 6/10 - The lone goal conceded wasn't his fault entirely as he did\n\nmanage to keep out Carmona's effort and he can't help that Freire decided to assist Aviles in\n\nmarking the same player leading up to the goal.\n\nRB: Marcelo Weigandt - 5/10 - Struggled defensively in the first half but managed to turn\n\nthings around after the halftime break. Ended the night in poor fashion with a clumsy challenge\n\nin stoppage time that resulted in a converted penalty for Red Bulls.\n\nCB: Tomas Aviles - 7/10 - One of Miami's best performers on the night as he kept them in the\n\ncontest with several last-ditch tackles and challenges.\n\nCB: Nicolas Freire - 6/10 - Was pulled way out of position for New York's opening goal.\n\nLB: Franco Negri - 6/10 - A quiet night overall from the veteran full-back.\n\nCM: Julian Gressel - 6/10 - Showed off his impressive passing range here and there but\n\nnothing much to write home about.\n\nCM: Sergio Busquets - 8/10 - Another timeless performance from the veteran midfielder\n\nagainst the dynamic pairing of Frankie Amaya and Daniel Edelman.\n\nCM: David Ruiz - 7/10 - Displayed great anticipation with a few well-timed challenges in the first\n\nhalf. Unfortunate to be hooked for Rojas at the start of the second half.\n\nRW: Lionel Messi - 10/10 - Perhaps his best showing in a Miami shirt even though he only\n\nmanaged to find the back of the net once. His five assists set a new record for most in an MLS\n\nmatch and he'll no doubt be the MVP frontrunner after this week's matches - if he already\n\nwasn't the frontrunner, that is.\n\nSUB: Matias Rohas (46' for Ruiz) - 9/10 - Came on and instantly changed the game with a\n\nperfect strike from distance to level the score.\n\nGerardo 'Tata' Martino - 9/10 - A slow start occurred once again for his team, but that clearly\n\ndidn't affect them as they went on to put six past Coronel. His decision to bring on Rojas was a\n\nmasterstroke, and Miami continue to look like the best team in MLS and are capable of flipping\n\nthe switch in a moment's notice to go all-out in attack.",

Gerardo 'Tata' Martino's team have pulled off wins against Sporting Kansas City, Nashville SC and New England Revolution in which the Herons went behind first in the early stages but still managed to turn the game around.\n\nMiami have also been in incredible goal-scoring form, scoring 10 goals during the win streak -- they've managed three against SKC and Nashville and four vs the Revs -- to propel themselves to first place in the Supporters' Shield table with 21 points from 11 games played.\n\nRed Bulls have impressed for the most part under first-year head coach Sandro Schwarz, who's guided his team to seventh place in the Supporters' Shield race and third place in the Eastern Conference standings with 18 points from 10 games played.\n\nNew York started their 2024 campaign winning their first four out of six games played that includes a 4-0 trashing of Miami at Red Bull Arena back in March, but have found wins hard to come by with three consecutive draws against Chicago Fire, LAFC and Vancouver Whitecaps.\n\nHere is 90min's guide to Inter Miami vs New York Red Bulls in MLS.\n\nVeteran full-back Jordi Alba is still on the treatment table and nursing a hamstring injury, and you can expect for Franco Negri to fill in at left-back in the meantime. Fellow defender Serhiy Kryvstov is also dealing with a hamstring problem and is expected to be back in action later in May, with Nicolas Freire taking up shop at left center-back in his absence.\n\nNew signing Federico Redondo is expected to return to action later this month as he's still recovering from a knee injury.\n\nInter Miami predicted lineup vs New York Red Bulls ( 4-3-3 ): Callender; Weigandt, Aviles, Freire, Negri; Gressel, Busquets, Ruiz; Messi, Suarez, Taylor.\n\nRed Bulls center-back Noah Eile, who's started seven games this season, will miss the primetime clash due to being sent off last weekend against the Whitecaps. Eile was shown a straight red late on in the game, and Andres Reyes will look to take his place in the lineup Saturday night.\n\nPeter Stroud and Serge Ngoma are dealing with respective ankle and knee injuries and are expected to be sidelined through late May.\n\nNew York Red Bulls predicted lineup vs Inter Miami ( 4-4-2 ): Coronel; Dylan Nealis, Sean Nealis, Reyes, Tolkin; Carmona, Edelman, Amaya, Forsberg; Morgan, Vanzeir.\n\nThis contest is shaping up to be one of the most entertaining and intriguing ones of the 2024 season so far with Lionel Messi and Emil Forsberg going head-to-head. Miami will be favorites to claim all three points at home with most of their first-choice players available, while New York shouldn't be written off as they've proven to be a top side in 2024.\n\nThe stars will shine Saturday night at Chase Stadium with the Herons picking up three crucial points to create a little separation between them and Red Bulls in the Eastern Conference table.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporters'_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supporters' Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Kansas_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sporting Kansas City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_MX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liga MX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.F._Monterrey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C.F.

break.\n\nWithout Messi, Miami had fallen to a 4-0 defeat to the Red Bulls in New York in March, but they more than avenged that loss with their merciless second half demolition job.\n\nDante Vanzeir had put the Red Bulls ahead in the 30th minute, slotting home after Wikelman Carmona's shot came out off the post, following a superb through pass from Swedish playmaker Emil Forsberg.\n\nGerardo Martino's Inter lacked intensity and ideas in the opening 45 minutes but the coach's half-time change transformed the game.\n\nParaguayan Rojas was introduced for the second half and took just three minutes to make an impact, collecting a pass from Messi and evading two defenders before unleashing an unstoppable drive from 25 yards out.\n\nMessi then put Miami in front when Rojas robbed Carmona and found Suarez who slipped the ball to the Argentine who made no mistake.\n\nMore from this section At this Red Dress Day walk, a First Nations woman explains why she's a 'helicopter' mom Fed's

he split the New York defence with a brilliant through ball to Rojas who deftly chipped over the advancing Carlos Coronel.\n\nSuarez's hat trick then came in the space of 12 minutes -- he first found the target when Messi chipped in a ball from the right and the Uruguayan hooked home a volley.\n\nIt was playground stuff minutes later when Suarez played a one-two with Messi and then poked home to make it 5-1.\n\nMessi was yet again the creator for Miami's sixth which Suarez turned in from close range from the tightest of angles.\n\nNew York, who came into the game third in the East, had a late

Despite missing four games, Messi wasted no time in making his presence felt, immediately propelling himself into the limelight of the MLS Golden Boot Race. Furthermore, his stellar performances have firmly positioned him as a frontrunner for the coveted title of 2024 MLS MVP.\n\nThe accolade of MLS Player of the Month isn't just handed out; it's earned through sheer excellence. Voted upon by a panel of esteemed national media members, this recognition underscores Messi's undeniable impact on the league. And it's not just a personal triumph; it's a testament to Inter Miami's growing dominance, with Luis Suarez having claimed the honor in the preceding months.\n\nAs the Herons gear up for their upcoming clash with the New York Red Bulls, all eyes are on Messi and his band of warriors. It's not just a match; it's a showdown between the titans of the Eastern Conference. Sitting comfortably at the summit, Inter Miami faces off against the formidable No. 3 RBNY, promising an electrifying encounter to keep fans on the edge of their seats.\n\nIn a league where every match is a battle, Lionel Messi stands tall as a beacon of excellence, leaving an indelible mark on the MLS landscape. And as he leads Inter Miami into yet another pivotal encounter, one thing remains abundantly clear: the Messi magic is alive and thriving in MLS.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Player_of_the_Month", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MLS Player of the Month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lionel-Messi-wins-first-ever-MLS-Player-of-the-Month.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

On Saturday night, he came out in the second half against the New York Red Bulls and took the game over. Messi set an MLS record with five assists, all in the second half, and added a goal to earn a second mark for most goal contributions in a game.\n\nLuis Suarez was the main beneficiary with a hat-trick (and an assist) during the match and now has 10 goals himself this season.\n\nIt turns out those guys are pretty good. However, Inter Miami needed to build a team around its core of older Barcelona stars: Messi, Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. It has required some salary cap gymnastics, complicated further by injuries. In their first preseason game of the year, Miami midfielder Facundo Farias suffered a season-ending injury. It was probably the worst complementary player to go down and Miami still hasn't found a winger to replace him.\n\nMiami has a handful of other key players who have also missed time with injury this year including Benjamin Cremaschi, Federico Redondo, Diego Gomez and Alba. Three of those four would have been in the starting lineup on Saturday if healthy.\n\nBut Miami has not stopped building the squad around Messi as they shove all the chips into the middle of the table and aim for an MLS Cup. The addition of Paraguayan midfielder Matias Rojas has the potential to be a real game-changer in terms of the depth Miami will need to navigate the long MLS season.\n\nRojas, as one person working in the league told The Athletic when he signed, is a designated player for pretty much any other MLS team. And he probably would've been a DP for Miami, too, if not for a unique situation in Brazil. (Goal.com reported last summer that Rojas' salary at Corinthians would be around $1.44 million.)\n\nRojas left his contract with Corinthians by voiding the deal due to several late and unpaid image rights payments. According to Globo, Rojas claimed more than $1 million in unpaid image rights from Corinthians and sought not just to terminate his deal, but to get full payment through the life of the deal, which ran through 2027. Corinthians has appealed to FIFA but put out a statement that said, \"FIFA granted Mat\u00edas Rojas permission to carry out his professional activity, guaranteeing only the right to work. In relation to any amounts that may be owed, the case still depends on FIFA's arbitration decision.\"\n\nOn Saturday against the Red Bulls, Rojas showed his DP-level quality.\n\nThe 28-year-old midfielder entered the game and immediately changed it with his vision and runs through midfield. Rojas' first finish was pure quality, a burst to get away from defenders and a left-footed strike back across the goal inside the far post.\n\nDespite playing in just his second game with Inter Miami, Rojas demonstrated strong chemistry with Messi. His second goal showed the connection - Rojas' run, Messi's gorgeous pass through RBNY's back line and Rojas' chipped finish.\n\nInter Miami coach Tata Martino said they knew they wanted to work Rojas into the team slowly - he hadn't played consistently in a month - but Martino said Rojas had shown chemistry with the team in training sessions.\n\n\"Mat\u00edas is a player who has a lot of quality; he is a footballer who has an enviable left foot and what we are looking for is to take him little by little,\" Martino said. \"I think today we saw a very good 45-minute version of Mat\u00edas and we hope this continues.\"\n\nThe problem now is unlocking exactly where to play Rojas, Martino said, but as Inter Miami gets healthy, the Paraguayan has provided yet another dangerous option to employ.\n\nOf course, you can probably put him anywhere on the field as long as Messi is being Messi. So far, that's been good enough for Miami to sit comfortably in first place.\n\nPaul Tenorio\n\nOptimism and good vibes have been in short supply for the San Jose Earthquakes this season, but maybe -- just maybe -- the last two weeks will jumpstart a sluggish 2024 season.\n\nThe Quakes delivered their best performance of the season on Saturday with a 3-1 win over LAFC in front of 43,774 fans at Levi Stadium.\n\nIt wasn't just the result over a rival that could give San Jose a jolt, it was the nature of the performance. DP winger Cristian Espinoza delivered a great performance with two assists, key winter-signing Amahl Pellegrino scored and, perhaps most importantly, club-record signing Hern\u00e1n L\u00f3pez came off the bench for his debut at halftime.\n\n\"Soccer is an easy thing when you have confidence,\" Pellegrino said. \"To get a huge win like this with a good performance, too, makes things easier.\"\n\nThough LAFC had the (slight) edge in goal difference, game states played a key role. San Jose scored a goal from a corner early then extended its lead to 3-0 in the 59th minute.\n\nIn his debut, L\u00f3pez flashed the quality that convinced San Jose to complete a club-record deal of around $6 million to sign him on deadline day of the primary transfer window. It was a surprise he was cleared to play on Saturday. The initial plan was to unveil him to the fans at halftime, but his work visa came through earlier than expected and he was available for selection.\n\n\"It was something that made me a little nervous, I'm not going to lie,\" L\u00f3pez said. \"But I took it in stride. I was prepared for it and excited to get out there and show what I've got.\"\n\nIt was just San Jose's second win of the season and the team still sits bottom of the Western Conference, but it's only May and the MLS season is long. They have a pivotal stretch coming up, entering the U.S. Open Cup in the round of 32 on Tuesday followed by a few key MLS games to potentially build on.\n\nTom Bogert\n\nAlthough the Chicago Fire suffered another defeat at home, this time 1-0 to New England, Saturday provided a milestone moment for Omari Glasgow. The winger made his MLS debut in the 79th minute, checking in for Brian Guti\u00e9rrez. The 20-year-old is already a vital player for the Guyana men's national team with 16 goals in 22 senior caps. He also led all players with seven goals in the 2023-24 CONCACAF Nations League B, helping the Golden Jaguars earn promotion into Group A to test themselves against teams like the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nGlasgow's debut is a product of one of the league's newest roster mechanisms. Chicago signed the winger from its MLS Next Pro affiliate, Chicago Fire FC II, utilizing a short-term agreement to bring Glasgow into the fold. The stipulations around such a loan are clearly defined: a club may sign a player, age 25 or younger during the league season, from its affiliate to a maximum of four short-term agreements (up to four-day contracts) each season. An individual player may be included on up to four MLS league season match rosters each season; however, that player may appear in no more than two MLS league season matches.\n\nTo some club sporting executives, the limiting structure around these loan-ups limits their effectiveness for the player involved. There isn't currently a tracker of all short-term loans on either the MLS website or the Next Pro. Working off club press releases, there have been 21 short-term loans to date in the 2024 season. Of those cases, only five players saw the field in an MLS match, totaling 68 minutes of action. Lo\u00efs Mensanvi (Minnesota United) is the only player to appear in two MLS games, while Georgi Minoungou (Seattle) also made his MLS debut this weekend.\n\nThese players are often called in to fill the squad during international windows or instances when multiple first-teamers are otherwise unavailable. If they represent the proverbial \"31st option\" on a team, one wouldn't expect them to log major minutes. Nevertheless, the narrow window of involvement limits the impact on the young player who gets a rare work-study opportunity with the first team.\n\n\"You can only play the academy player two times, then you have to give him a contract,\" one chief soccer officer told The Athletic. \"That's difficult given roster restrictions. I don't think that provides a good flow to develop players.\" The CSO added that players seldom get more than one training session with the first team, limiting the chance they'll pick up training habits from their older temporary teammates.\n\nFor the second time in four days, Jack McGlynn launched a laser shot into the back of the net with his special left foot. Saturday's encore was an even better strike than Tuesday's golazo.\n\n\"For my money, you can't score a much better one and in a better moment,\" head coach Jim Curtin said.\n\nThe U.S. youth international continues to impress and develop. The 20-year-old has long had suitors abroad, but the Union believed McGlynn's development was best served in Philadelphia a bit longer than previous players like Brenden Aaronson, Paxten Aaronson and Mark McKenzie.\n\nIt'd be hard to argue against the progress.\n\nMcGlynn has already accrued 109 first-team appearances before his 21st birthday. Each year, his importance and responsibility increase. Last season, it was clear McGlynn was the best forward passer out of the midfield, the one most likely to break lines. He embraced it. This year, the coaching staff has pushed him to shoot more. This week, at least, he's certainly embraced that, too.\n\nThe central midfielder was a constant for the United States Under-20 side last cycle, culminating with a starting role at the Under-20 World Cup. He's a lock to play a role for the U.S. Olympic team this summer and a transfer could be right around the corner, either before the European summer deadline or the following January.\n\nPhilly has preferred to keep its players through the season, something that is also hard to argue given the team's success and the deals they've eventually earned for both the Aaronson brothers and McKenzie, all of which stuck around until January.\n\nTeams in England and elsewhere in Europe have long had McGlynn on their radars. The timing seems right for a move in the next nine months. Picking the right next step will be crucial.\n\nHistorically, marquee matchups between the Seattle Sounders and the LA Galaxy have been prime showcases for some of the league's most prolific attackers. On Sunday, it instead was a second-half showcase for a couple of veteran goalkeepers.\n\nBoth teams sent in nine shots after halftime, managing an identical two on target. In truth, each attack could have offered a greater threat. The LA Galaxy lacked its usual verve in transition as Riqui Puig missed out due to yellow card accumulation. Although the Sounders racked up attacking third touches to earn a 62.2% field tilt advantage, the final quarter-hour saw many players in possession pointing and shouting at teammates, begging for some off-ball movement.\n\nDespite lengthy gaps between shots faced, both goalkeepers stayed sharp to protect a clean sheet. After dealing with a hamstring injury in the early months, Stefan Frei looked like his usual cool and collected self. The Sounders legend stymied Joseph Paintsil from point-blank range before the referee blew the play offside, then managed a crucial stop on Diego Fagundez.\n\nHis opposite number, John McCarthy, is still acclimating after leaving one Los Angeles team for the other this offseason. A longtime deputy for Philadelphia and LAFC, he has rewarded the Galaxy for finally entrusting him atop its goalkeeper depth chart -- a similar long-awaited breakthrough that's reminiscent of Brad Stuver's exploits since Austin FC debuted in 2021. McCarthy has been among MLS's finest shot-stoppers in the season's first trimester.\n\nMcCarthy was one of two goalkeepers that two-time reigning Western Conference champion LAFC allowed to leave in free agency -- Maxime Crepeau joined the Portland Timbers after a two-year stay. Both McCarthy and Crepeau have provided good shot-stopping value compared to expected goals conceded, with the table above accounting for shot volume.\n\nWorryingly for their former employer, their replacement, storied French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, has been among the league's worst at preventing goals in the season's early months. LAFC was on the wrong side of San Jose's statement win, with Lloris caught flat-footed on the opening goal and in no-man's-land as he was far too slow to close the angle on the Quakes' second.\n\nThe underlying numbers warned this might happen as the 37-year-old is firmly in his twilight years. Undoubtedly, LAFC will hope his big-game prowess will remain timeless through the season.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

You get tight, he's going to roll you, drop the shoulder and get by you. The thing you have to do - and I'm making it sound easy sat here - is stop the supply. I know that's not easy but once that ball gets to Messi's feet, forget about it. You're in trouble, it's too late.\"\n\nMessi's latest masterclass came in a 6-2 demolition of the Red Bulls, where he contributed to all six goals. Wright-Phillips marveled at Messi's ability to raise the bar of individual brilliance, noting,\"The numbers, I love to see them and look at them. He will look back and say what I have done there is amazing, but it's just how easy the game comes to him. The first touch is always good. The weight of his pass to a team-mate is always good. How he drives and goes by players, is always top level. Watching him is unbelievable.\" Messi's impeccable first touch, precise passing, and unmatched dribbling ability make him a force to be reckoned with on the pitch.\n\nWhat's next for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami\n\nWith 12 goals and 11 assists already this season, Messi is the leading candidate for MVP honors in MLS. His presence continues to draw A-list guests to each fixture, turning Inter Miami's games into must-watch events. As Messi and Inter Miami prepare to take on Montreal in their next fixture, the traveling roadshow of Messi's talent is set to captivate audiences once again.\n\nLionel Messi's arrival in MLS has brought a new level of excitement and anticipation to the league. With his unstoppable form and talismanic presence, Messi is redefining what it means to be a superstar in North American soccer. As Inter Miami's opponents grapple with the challenge of containing Messi, the rest of the division braces itself for the impact of his unparalleled talent.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Wright-Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Wright-Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Season_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLS Season Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Inter-Miami-news-MLS-gets-major-Lionel-Messi-warning.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Messi and Antonella shine alongside Luis Suarez and Sofia Balbi at Bresh party\n\nTo think of Inter Miami is to think of Lionel Messi, but behind him there is a man who works in the shadows and is arguably more important than the FIFA World Cup winner. Xavier Asensi is the general manager of the club with the biggest economic and media growth in 2023 and this year he expects to turn over at least $200 million.\n\nThis exponential growth in economic figures is due, in part, to agreements with large international companies that have linked their image with that of Inter Miami and Messi, who is widely regarded as the greatest soccer player of all time. The latest has been with international giant Visa.\n\n\"With the arrival of Messi, we have gone from having budgeted just over 60 million to end up billing around 125 or 130 million dollars,\" Asensi told EFE. \"That's a huge amount for a temporary stadium.\n\n\"We are very happy with this sponsorship. It is a matter not only of quantity but also of quality. We are looking for those 'partners' that take us to another level and there are also obviously Royal Caribbean and JP Morgan Chase.\"\n\nMessi joined David Beckham's MLS side in the middle of 2023 after confirming his exit from PSG and European soccer, becoming the biggest coup in the history of the league and arguably all of American sports.\n\nBy penning his name to Inter Miami, Messi transformed the amount of attention on the MLS and his new club overnight as fans, brands and millions of people began to watch the league with intense focus to see how the Argentinian would perform.\n\n\"Leo takes you to another level,\" Asensi added. \"But then also the levels of demand you ask of the partners are different.\n\n\"We are very happy with the way we are, very proud of the team and all the work that is being done. We just have to keep improving.\"\n\nAsensi added, \"That's exactly right. I spent 11 years at Barca, I was the chief commercial officer there.

Dante Vanzeir had given New York the lead in the 30th minute, finishing off a rebound from Wikelman Carmona's shot that struck the post, following a brilliant through pass from Emil Forsberg.\n\nInter Miami's lackluster first-half display was transformed by Gerardo Martino's halftime substitution. Rojas, brought on for the second half, made an immediate impact just three minutes in, collecting a pass from Messi and evading two defenders before unleashing an \"unstoppable drive from 25 yards out.\"\n\nMessi then put Miami ahead after Rojas dispossessed Carmona and found Suarez, who set up the Argentine for a clinical finish. The World Cup winner turned provider once more, splitting the New York defense with a \"brilliant through ball\" to Rojas, who deftly chipped over the advancing Carlos Coronel.\n\nWatch Lionel Messi's heroics against New York Red Bulls:\n\nSuarez's hat-trick came within a span of 12 minutes. First, he volleyed home a chipped ball from Messi. Minutes later, Suarez played a one-two with Messi before poking the ball into the net, making it 5-1. Messi was again the creator for Miami's sixth goal, which Suarez turned in from close range at the tightest of angles.\n\nNew York, who entered the game third in the Eastern Conference, scored a late consolation penalty through Forsberg in the final seconds.\n\n(Inputs from AP)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

And on Saturday night, that category expanded to include becoming the first MLS player ever to provide five assists in a single game, teeing up Luis Suarez for a hat trick and Matias Rojas for a brace in Inter Miami's 6-2 demolition of the New York Red Bulls.\n\nMessi also scored once himself to set another MLS record as the first player to make six goal contributions (goals plus assists) in a single match. That took his totals on the season to 10 goals and 12 assists in only eight matches (seven starts), with still two-thirds of the season to play.\n\nWhat's even more amazing is the entirety of this production game in the second half, after the Red Bulls entered halftime with a 1-0 lead. And in a league that is a rarity around the world in counting up to two assists per goal, all of Messi's were of the traditional, primary variety.\n\nThe Argentine eight-time Ballon d'Or winner is on a pace that could take down quite a few MLS single-season records. But the math is more complicated than it first appears.\n\nMessi could miss at least five regular season games due to his commitments for Argentina at the Copa America. And his injury track record recently suggest there will be at least a few more times this season he either doesn't play or is used off the bench due to minor knocks or load management, or both.\n\nEven so, his recent output of 10 goal contributions in his last two matches shows that no record is truly safe right now. Here are some of the biggest benchmarks he could target, and an analysis of how likely success may be.\n\nMessi's 10 goals in eight games are above the pace at Vela scored his 34 goals in 31 appearances. But the ceiling on Messi's potential MLS appearances in the neighborhood of 24, and 21 or 22 may be more likely.\n\nHe'd have to increase his scoring production from his already blistering pace, and he'd have to do it presumably while Luis Suarez is also on the field making himself an open target for an easier finish when defenses are understandably drawn to Messi.\n\nThe equation might change if Suarez -- who deals with chronic ankle issues -- suddenly becomes unavailable and Messi has to shoulder more of the finishing duties. But as it currently stands, this one feels like a fringe too far, even for the game's greatest living player.\n\nPrognosis: Unlikely.\n\nFor all the fuss we give over the top goal scorers in MLS history, Valderrama's record might be one of the most impressive in the entire MLS Fact and Record Book. It has certainly stood the test of time.\n\nEl Pibe was an MLS original, and yet it took him five seasons before he found the right partner -- Senegalese striker Mamadou Diallo -- to unlock the kind of chemistry that led to the posting of a number in 2000 that has never been seriously challenged.\n\nThere is also a lurking variable here, which is that the criteria for secondary assists became more stringent in the years that followed Valderrama's historic 2020 campaign.\n\nBut even before Messi's explosion on Saturday night, he was on pace to at least approach this number if he missed only 10 or so games for the Herons.\n\nWith all the variables at play, it's probably not fair to expect Messi to reach this number. But it's certainly far more in play than the goal-scoring record. And it would probably be surprising if he doesn't surpass 20 assists to climb to second on the list in front of Sacha Kljestan and Maxi Moralez.\n\nPrognosis: Possible.\n\nMartinez shattered the previous MLS record when he scored in 15 consecutive MLS appearances during the 2019 season. And yet Messi has already gone more than halfway toward equaling the total by scoring in eight consecutive games.\n\nThis has been one of Messi's sneakier accomplishments so far, since he was absent for a stretch of a few weeks dealing with a calf issue. But it certainly feels like something that is in the realm of possibility, given that this is already his second such stretch of scoring in at least seven consecutive appearances in a single competition: The first came during the 2023 Leagues Cup, when he scored in all seven matches while Miami stormed to the championship.\n\nMuch like the singe-season assists record, this feels like a category where it will be surprising if he doesn't at least reach 11 consecutive games with a goal to pull equal with Vela in second place on the list.\n\nPrognosis: Possible\n\nMessi is currently ahead of Vela's 2019 pace, with 1.25 goals scored per appearance. And there doesn't seem to be any reason not to expect that to continue.\n\nIf anything, it could potentially accelerate because of Messi's role as Miami's primary penalty taker. While the Herons captain has handed off those duties at times to teammates, he's still likely to receive more opportunities from the spot than the one he's taken so far in eight matches.\n\nThe only thing that could work against Messi is if he gets into an injury situation where he becomes less than 90 minutes fit and has to be used in shorter shifts. Because this record is kept by a per-appearance count, rather than a per-90-minutes ratio that is often cited on sites like FBref.com and others.\n\nPrognosis: Likely\n\nAmazingly, Valderrama set this mark in 1997 by contributing 19 assists in 20 appearances, three years prior to posting his incredible 26-assist season.\n\nThe difference between those campaigns is that in 1997, Valderrama was still suiting up regularly for the Colombian national team, which often took him away from MLS commitments. By 2000 he had retired from international play and was free to focus fully on the Tampa Bay Mutiny, though he had also slowed slightly in overall rate of production.\n\nMessi was already on pace to fractionally surpass this record prior to Saturday night's five-assist masterclass, and now he's currently averaging 1.50 assists per MLS appearance.\n\nThe only reason to be cautious about his chances to surpass Valderrama is that this record is reliant on his teammates. And the bulk of his assists have been in service of Suarez, who is also in his mid-30s and could potentially need to load manage as the season progresses. Even so, this feels like an area where Messi's production could continue to trend upward over the long haul as relationships with younger teammates become stronger over time.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Vela", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Vela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Valderrama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Valderrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamadou_Diallo_(footballer,_born_1971)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mamadou Diallo (footballer, born 1971)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Kljestan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacha Kljestan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximiliano_Moralez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maximiliano Moralez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leagues_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leagues Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Mutiny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Mutiny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663718540458c8e8d04bae9b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2176,1225,x0,y112,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 1813, "textEnd": 1819}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

There's always a little bit of an unknown when you've been out so long, how that adaptation is going to go. ... It's definitely surpassed what I expected of myself just because it was such a serious injury last year.\"\n\nMorgan was referring to a nagging hip injury -- eventually discovered to be a tear of the psoas muscle -- that had stemmed from an injury at the end of the 2022 season and plagued him into 2023, when he was limited to just six total matches between MLS regular-season and Leagues Cup matches.\n\nMorgan, 27, had avoided major injuries during his decade-long soccer career, which has included stops with Celtic FC in Scotland and lower-tier Sunderland in England, and last season's predicament made him feel \"like a fraud\" because he couldn't contribute to his team.\n\nThis season, it's safe to say that feeling has gone away.\n\n\"Lewis has been killing it and he's been killing it in practice and in preseason as well,\" Red Bulls defender Sean Nealis said. \"I think we're seeing the results on the field on game day. ... It's a huge plus to have him back. A couple of games he's scored these goals that last year they might have been one point where this year it's three points.\"\n\nWhile Morgan has flourished in his recovery from hip surgery in September -- the focus of a team-produced documentary released this week -- he admitted he had to tackle the fear of re-injury.\n\n\"It's more like maybe the first time I was back on the grass there probably would have been a bit of hesitation,\" Morgan said.\n\n\"By the time you get to the game, you check everything off. Maybe the last thing is that real 100 percent game contact and once you get a couple of them and you realize you know what, like I'm ready. Then it goes out of your mind. I don't have any hesitations when I go on the pitch anymore.\"\n\nThe Red Bulls are back on the road Saturday to face Inter Miami after having decimated a Messi-less roster in a 4-0 win at Red Bull Arena in March -- punctuated by Morgan's hat trick.\n\nBut Messi is expected to be on the pitch in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., as the Red Bulls (4-1-5) look to make up ground on Eastern Conference-leading Inter Miami (6-2-3) and try to repeat some of that success they had back in March.\n\n\"So I missed a lot of that opportunity last year [to contribute], but this year, so far, we've been able to get over the injury stuff and now I'm contributing and you feel like you're doing what you should be doing,\" Morgan said.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Arango", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Arango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Morgan_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Morgan (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Whitecaps_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Whitecaps FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Salt_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Salt Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Benteke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Benteke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leagues_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leagues Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunderland A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Nealis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Nealis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-tgodeggr7-1714754448705.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1714740119&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

When we have Leo, every team plays against us like it were a final,\" Weigandt said. \"And we have to play every game like it's a final to try if we want to achieve what we aspire to. But the team looks good, we're happy and we work hard throughout the week.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\n\"They give us ideas and we try to execute them on the pitch,\" added Weigandt when speaking to the media ahead of Thursday's training session.\n\nMiami last faced the Red Bulls on March 23, falling 4-0 without Messi. The Argentine striker failed to travel with the team due to a right hamstring injury, leaving head coach Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino to depend on Luis Su\u00e1rez and Leo Campana.\n\nNow, Messi is available for selection on Saturday and is expected to see time on the pitch playing as a No. 9.\n\n\"We've talked about [Messi playing as a 9] and I think recuperating Leo in those points of the pitch is a great point for us,\" Martino said. \"He doesn't exhaust himself coming and going, not that he can't do it, he can move anywhere he wants on the pitch, but we shouldn't deprive ourselves from the moment of his participation in the final moments of the play.\n\n\"Beyond being the greatest player in the world, he's a great goalscorer. So, we need to try to find him in different phases of the game. If he participates in every part of our attack, we have more opportunities.\"\n\nSince Messi's return from injury on April 6, he's contributed with six goals and four assists -- and Miami has not lost a game in which the World Cup winner has played. Off the field, Weigandt said he continuously impacts the younger players to strive for greatness.\n\n\"Honestly it's been extraordinary [playing with Messi], Leo is very humble and simple. He's a great person, and compliments the team well. He talks to us to inspire us.

The Herons were without Lionel Messi that day, who was sidelined by a hamstring injury. Their other superstar forward, Luis Suarez, played a full 90 minutes and drew a blank in the embarrassing defeat.\n\nOn Saturday, the Uruguayan exacted revenge. Inter hosted the Red Bulls at Chase Stadium, thrashing Sandro Schwarz's side 6-2, with Suarez plundering a hat-trick.\n\nAs has often been the case this term, Miami initially fell behind and even trailed 1-0 at half-time. Then Suarez, Messi and Matias Rojas took over. Messi took his tally for the season to 10 with Inter's second goal of the game, assisted by Suarez, and the Argentinian magician assisted all five of Miami's other goals, laying on twice for Rojas before Suarez ran rampant in 13 second-half minutes.\n\nAnd each of the former Liverpool and Barcelona superstar's strikes were vintage Suarez. The first saw him contort his body, twisting mid-air, to connect with a scissor-kick volley from 12 yards. He then exchanged a one-two with Messi to squeeze through a space tighter than a pair of drainpipe jeans on a Noughties indie hipster (thank God my old MySpace page is no longer accessible!) to score. And finally, picked out by Messi close to goal, he calmly rounded keeper Carlos Coronel.\n\nSuarez's treble took him level atop the Golden Boot standings with Messi. The 37-year-old striker now has 10 goals in 11 MLS appearances, from chances worth an expected goals (xG) total of just 6.22. Meanwhile, Messi's six goal contributions against the Red Bulls set an MLS single-game record and took him to nine assists for the season, a tally no player in the league can match.\n\n\"It's easier with Leo,\" Suarez said post-match. \"Obviously we know each other, and sometimes you'll notice we know where the other is and do movements without having to look at one another. It's good for the team.\"\n\nThe win took Miami's unbeaten streak to six league games, dating back to their reverse against the Red Bulls. They remain top of the Western Conference and frontrunners for the Supports' Shield. With Suarez and Messi fit and firing, they're close to unstoppable.\n\nSky-high Surridge\n\nThe second winner this week is another hat-trick hero; one who, in truth, needed it a lot more than Suarez.\n\nFormer England under-21 striker Sam Surridge hasn't had a Suarez-like start to life in MLS. The 25-year-old joined Nashville SC from Nottingham Forest last July in a \u00a35million deal. In the remainder of the 2023 MLS season, he scored just twice in nine appearances.\n\nGoing into last weekend's fixtures, Surridge had matched that modest return, albeit this time in seven games. But even this uptick in efficiency hardly represented the kind of output expected of a striker with Premier League experience who'd been brought in on a Designated Player contract.\n\nOn Saturday, however, against the high-flying Vancouver Whitecaps, Surridge ignited his nascent MLS career.\n\nThe ex-Stoke City and Bournemouth man put his side ahead after just 10 minutes, before returning veteran centre-back Walker Zimmerman scored with a powerful header from a corner - the two-time MLS Defender of the Year would also score at the other end in what was his first start after two months out injured.\n\nSurridge's second goal would have most pleased manager Gary Smith, as it showed a developing understanding with Hany Mukhtar, the team's undisputed star player. The German attacking midfielder, who was the MLS MVP in 2022, picked out Surridge inside the penalty area and the Englishman finished emphatically into the bottom corner.\n\nThe hat-trick-clinching strike arrived 10 minutes from time, as Surridge slotted home from close range. It sealed a 4-1 victory for Nashville, ending a five-game winless streak for the club who have never failed to make the play-offs since joining MLS in 2020.\n\n\"If we just keep doing that at home, we're going to be all right,\" Surridge said. \"I think we're going to do really well. Having that confidence that we can now shut out games, I see the sky is the limit for us, I think.\"\n\nLightning strikes twice for LA\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, the San Jose Earthquakes handed Los Angeles FC a first defeat of the 2023 MLS season.\n\nA repeat on Saturday seemed unlikely, as the Quakes began the weekend rooted to the bottom of the Western Conference standings with one win from 10 games.\n\nYet somehow LAFC, a side with title ambitions, conspired to collapse against their inter-state rivals and were beaten 3-1 at Levi's Stadium, the home of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers. And they only had themselves to blame.\n\nSteve Cherundolo's side twice conceded sloppily from set plays, including once to an own goal by star man Denis Bouanga, while for San Jose's other goal, LA were easily played through on a counter-attack.\n\nThe result left LAFC seventh in the West, with as many defeats as wins (four), and they have not won away from home all season. It was also the fourth match in a row in which they've conceded two or more goals.\n\nOlivier Giroud's headline-grabbing summer arrival might help spark their frontline into life. But the suave striker will not be able to fix the defensive ills that can be traced back to Giorgio Chiellini's retirement at the end of last season.\n\nAtlanta United were beaten at home in smash-and-grab style by rising Eastern Conference contenders Minnesota United at the Mercedes Benz Stadium on Saturday, losing 2-1 to the Loons despite racking up 20 shots to their opponents' 12 and 2.9 xG to 0.9.\n\nBut while those statistics suggest the home side were unlucky - and a late rally almost mustered an equaliser, as Georgios Giakoumakis hit the bar after Saba Lobjanidze had pulled back a goal in the 82nd minute - Atlanta's abject defending for Minnesota's goals was, well, indefensible.\n\nFirst, slack marking at a corner allowed Kervin Arriaga to score in the 54th minute. Then, just six minutes later, Tani Oluwaseyi was given free rein to drive into Atlanta's defensive third and unleash a 20-yard racket past former Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan.\n\nThe defeat to Eric Ramsay's side means Atlanta have taken just one point from their last three home games and sit 10th in the East, outside the play-off positions. For a talented squad that, in Thiago Almada, boasts arguably the best player outside of Miami, it's not good enough.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News

How to watch and odds\n\nDate: Saturday, May 4 | Time: 7:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Chase Stadium -- Fort Lauderdale, Florida\n\nLive stream: MLS Season Pass\n\nOdds: Inter - 116; Draw +280; NYRB +320 (via Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nStorylines\n\nInter: The loss to Monterrey in the Concacaf Champions Cup quarterfinals on April 10 forced the club to rethink things in terms of their season priority. It's now fully on the MLS season for now and it's noticeable how seriously they are taking it. Since that defeat, Inter have won their last three games and have scored at least three goals in each. Can they break down a NYRB defense allowing 1.0 goals per game? Expect Inter to at least put a couple away.\n\nNYRB: A solid start to the campaign has them fully in the mix for a playoff spot, but there is a long way to go. The ability to ground out results, with just one of their first 10 games ending in a loss, means they are competing on both ends of the pitch and frustrating opponents. They'll gladly take a draw here, but they will need to look to counter a team that likes to push high.\n\nPrediction\n\nMessi gets on the scoresheet again as the Herons take all three points.

He'll be used to that, though, having ruled the world with his old pal at Barcelona and now on the East Coast.\n\nIn achieving such a ridiculous feat, Messi also became the first player in the history of football to reach 1200 goal contributions. He is quite literally hitting unheard of numbers. Scientists couldn't explain this kind of anomaly.\n\nJust when you think you've seen it all from the magician, he continues to surprise you, carving open vectors and black holes on the pitch with passes sharper than a diamond.\n\nREAD NEXT: We're happy to announce that Lionel Messi is making the MLS his own personal playground\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name every team Lionel Messi failed to score against for Barcelona?\n\nFive assists. We can't get over it. Especially when they look that sumptuous.\n\nSeriously, what do you even say as a manager or a coach in a bid to try and deal with such superhuman obscenities being committed against you? How do you close a gap that didn't actually exist in the first place?\n\nMagisterial is an understatement. He's redefining greatness.\n\nPeople will be quick to point out the fact that he isn't in Europe's top five anymore, but we don't care. As Scott Steiner famously once said, the numbers don't lie and they spell disaster for - well, every other Ballon d'Or candidate.\n\nPut together a convincing run in the Copa America and immediately it becomes a reality once again. If you're really quiet while you read this, you can actually hear Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe's tears hitting the floor.\n\nFear it, dread it, run from it. You cannot deny it. Somehow, Messi is chasing down Ballon d'Or number nine.", "source": {"uri": "planetfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planet Football"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitchell_wilks@planetfootball.com", "name": "Mitchell Wilks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ray Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rosario, Santa Fe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Steiner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Steiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd3nfwcxd527z59.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F05091828%2FMessi-assists-haul.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

So, we need to try to find him in different phases of the game. If he participates in every part of our attack, we have more opportunities.\"\n\nSince Messi's return from injury April 6, he has contributed with six goals and four assists -- and Miami has not lost a game in which the World Cup winner has played. Off the field, Weigandt said, Messi continuously inspires the younger players to strive for greatness.\n\n\"Honestly it's been extraordinary [playing with Messi], Leo is very humble and simple. He's a great person, and compliments the team well. He talks to us to inspire us. It's something so nice, that someone so important notices every detail of the group and the club, he makes us more professional,' said Weigandt, who joined Miami on loan from Boca Juniors in March.\n\n\"He's taught me to have my feet on the ground.

He recently arrived at Inter Miami to reinforce the MLS project alongside Messi, Busquets and Jordi Alba.\n\nThis Saturday, after The Herons' thumping 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls, in which he scored a hat-trick along with the Argentine, Su\u00e1rez spoke to the press in the mixed zone.\n\nFirstly, he took the time to praise the work of Paraguayan midfielder Matias Rojas, a player who recently arrived at the club but is already building a strong reputation in Miami: \"I'm not going to discover anything about what Mati is as a player, the quality he has, the years he has played in Argentine soccer, the season he spent in Brazil. He is a player who, if he is fit, makes a difference and we are grateful to have him in the team. These are his first minutes and he is an intelligent player who will help us\".\n\nSu\u00e1rez wants more intensity in Miami's games\n\nHe then spoke specifically about the match against New York RB: \"The result shows pretty much how the game went, but obviously the Inter Miami we want to see is one that starts the matches in a more intense way, one that doesn't make as many mistakes as we do; we have to be self-critical in that sense because there is going to be a game where we can't turn the result around.\"\n\nHe also took the opportunity to highlight a key point about Saturday's hat-trick: \"I'll take the goals, helping the team, turning around a game that we started very well in the second half and that has to be useful for the future. All goals are different, they are special and you enjoy them all in the same way\".\n\nThe way in which the Uruguayan and the 8-time Ballon d'Or winner understand each other is a key factor for The Herons, and success for the project relies heavily on them: \"Everything is easier with Leo.

The World Cup winner completed a free transfer to Miami after leaving Paris Saint-Germain last summer, turning his back on European football after almost two decades of unprecedented success and adulation, but instantly made it clear he wasn't in the United States to wind down towards retirement.\n\nWith the help of former Blaugrana teammates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, Messi went on to inspire Miami to its first-ever piece of silverware in the 2023 Leagues Cup, and although the team missed out on the MLS playoffs as the Argentine struggled with a series of injuries, the foundations were put in place for a very bright future.\n\nTata Martino was able to add another seven new players to his squad in the 2024 primary transfer window, including another Barcelona icon in the form of Luis Suarez and Paraguay international Matias Roja, which has only increased the level of expectation at DRV PNK Stadium.\n\nMiami's all-star side, who might as well be called 'The Florida Globetrotters' at this point, have lived up to the hype in the early stages of the 2024 season. They are sitting top of the Eastern Conference after 12 games, mainly thanks to Messi's brilliance, and will believe they can go on and lift the MLS Cup come November.\n\nHowever, the Herons may need a bit more depth to achieve that goal, and while they currently don't have any more international roster spots left to fill, that doesn't mean that they couldn't maneuver themselves into a position to

As a result of \"The Messi Effect,\" Sporting Kansas City and the New England Revolution set single-game attendance records. In Kansas City's case, over 72,000 fans watched Inter Miami play Sporting KC at Arrowhead Stadium. Not long after, 65,612 people went to Gillette Stadium when Inter Miami defeated the New England Revolution. Those single-game statistics show the popularity of Lionel Messi and his star-studded Inter Miami lineup.\n\nBut how does the average attendance in MLS stack up against Europe's top leagues?\n\nWhen compared to attendance in the 2023/24 campaign from the top leagues in Europe, MLS fails to compare. The Bundesliga, Premier League, Serie A, LaLiga, and Ligue 1 all average higher attendances than Major League Soccer. On average, MLS pulls in 23,459 people per game. Even the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier in Germany, averages more fans per game. That division pulls 29,124 fans on average.\n\nWhen listing some of the top divisions in terms of global popularity, Major League Soccer does average a higher attendance than the English Championship. The second tier in England, which features 24 teams, is arguably the most popular second division in the world. That shows strong attendance figures, so MLS beating out that division is noteworthy.\n\nGranted, this list does not include every league worldwide with greater attendance figures than Major League Soccer. Rather, it focuses on Europe, where there is an ingrained history of soccer within the culture. Even though MLS is over 10,000 people behind compared to the Bundesliga and Premier League, certain factors play a role.\n\nOne of those is the size of stadiums used by the leagues. The average stadium capacity in Major League Soccer is 24,341. By comparison, the average in the Premier League is 39,288. Both MLS and the Premier League come up narrowly short of reaching full capacity at their games in the current campaign.\n\nTherefore, MLS can take several things away from its 'lower' attendance figures. One of those is the growth potential. MLS has fans who want to go to games. Particularly when you look at some of the younger franchises like Nashville SC or Atlanta United, audiences are not hard to come by. The challenge for MLS is trying to maintain this demand. If the league uses the argument of star power through players like Lionel Messi, the league must constantly re-up on these massive signings. Granted, no one player will compare to Lionel Messi in terms of popularity.\n\nMLS can also flirt with the idea of bigger stadiums. The soccer-specific grounds at GEODIS Park, Lower.com Field, TQL Stadium, and Q2 Stadium feature some of the best atmospheres.

We've got more high octane European semifinals, starting with two thrilling posed Champions League second legs. My name's James Benge, let's get into it!\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Footy fix\n\nAll times U.S./Eastern\n\nMonday, May 6\n\n\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde6 Pro League: Al Ahli vs. Al Hilal, 2 p.m. \u27a1\ufe0f Fox Soccer Plus\n\n\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f EPL: Crystal Palace vs. Manchester United, 3 p.m. \u27a1\ufe0f USA Network\n\n\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 Ligue 1: Lille vs. Lyon, 3 p.m. \u27a1\ufe0f beIN Sports\n\nTuesday, May 7\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa Champions League: Paris Saint-Germain vs. Borussia Dortmund, 3 p.m. \u27a1\ufe0f Paramount+\n\n\u26bd The Forward Line\ud83c\udfc6 Champions League up for grabs\n\nThe last step on the road to Wembley lies ahead of four teams this week, none of whom have been conclusively eliminated from contention at the halfway mark of the semifinals. Paris Saint-Germain have the most work to do and perhaps the most to fear if they fail to overcome their first leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. Falling to a team they were such heavy favorites against would bring enough questions in the first place, that it would almost certainly be their last dance with Kylian Mbappe will only heighten the sense that PSG's wait for European glory is not ending any time soon.\n\nTheir task will be harder without Lucas Hernandez, the center back paying a heavy price for his attempts to deny Niclas Fullkrug the winner in the Westfalenstadion last week. He will miss not only the run in but Euro 2024 and Luis Enrique does not have anyone quite as solid to take his place, with Lucas Beraldo expected to step in ahead of Milan Skriniar. Still, further forward there are fairly easy tweaks for the coaching staff to make that may pay dividend, as Jonathan Johnson noted after the first leg.\n\nJohnson: \"Expect Luis Enrique to tweak his attacking approach slightly going into that one with Mbappe's positioning and involvement much better in the second half and [Ousmane] Dembele in need of a slightly more clinical edge in front of goal. Randal Kolo Muani's cameo was interesting in terms of workrate but it might be Goncalo Ramos' predatory touch which makes the difference next week depending on Paris' approach to the scenario which still favors PSG -- just about.\"\n\nGet Mbappe right and it may not matter if Julian Ryerson repeats his impressive display from leg one. PSG might just have enough going for them to be slight favorites.\n\nDon't miss more from Johnson as he looks at PSG's homefield advantage.\n\nIt looks like the same equation for the home team on Wednesday night when Real Madrid host Bayern Munich after their exhilarating, somewhat chaotic, 2-2 draw in the Allianz Arena last time out. Vinicius Junior twice punished mistakes from Min-Jae Kim, scrubbing out a bright second half from the Bavarians where Leroy Sane and Harry Kane had thrust them into the lead. That was rather Bayern's season in microcosm, some of the best underlying metrics in Europe undone by clumsy work at the back. The outgoing Thomas Tuchel was all too prepared to make that implication clear, criticizing Kim for being \"greedy\" in his defending.\n\nBayern proved that when they get their defending right, they can do quite the number on Madrid, but we have long since reached the stage where it seems shrewd to price in some some of that mastery of their own fortune that Carlo Ancelotti's side show on nights like this. Madrid survived late onslaughts from RB Leipzig and Manchester City to get this far, might there just be something about this competition that give them the remorseless self belief to manufacture what would look like luck for anyone else? There'll be more time to discuss this game in Wednesday's newsletter, but for now get hyped people. This is the good stuff.\n\nSponsored by Paramount+\ud83d\udd17 Midfield Link Play\ud83e\udd29 Messi rains down the assists to make history\n\nI'm going to start by quibbling with just how assist-y some of those assists were -- Matias Rojas had quite a bit to do when his captain rolled him the ball at 1-0 down to New York Red Bulls -- but when you put up five of them it's probably going to be the case that the scorer has to do the brunt of the work at least once or twice. Anyway, the brilliance with which Messi played in Luis Suarez for Inter Miami's fifth was worth two assists as he drove through midfield with his No.9 and stopped in time to find space on the edge of the box to play a killer pass.\n\nFor the first time in MLS history, a player registered six goal involvements in a game: teeing up Suarez to register a hat trick, laying on another for Rojas and delivering one of those delicate clipped finishes across the goalkeeper to get on the scoresheet himself. Meanwhile, Inter Miami records are being obliterated before Messi has even reached a calendar year in Florida. He is already the all-time assist leader at the Herons, and with 23 goals from 25 games it is a matter of when, not if, he obliterates Gonzalo Higuain's high-water mark of 29.\n\nThat Messi would be the best player MLS had ever seen was never in doubt when he landed in Miami last summer. The only question was whether he would still be motivated to be the best version of himself having left Europe behind. The 36 year old might just be that and his team mates can attest to the standards it is driving from them. Rojas spoke to Deporte Total USA after the match on how great the demands are when you play with the great man.\n\nRojas: \"It's a big responsibility. There are two ways to approach playing with him, you can either sink or you can swim. In my opinion, he is the best in history. You can either play with the fact he will not understand your pressure or you let it go, and he solves all that with what he does. That pass to me for my second goal was something I didn't expect, but it makes it easier for you. You need to take advantage of that chemistry, and me and the team did just that.\"\n\nNo wonder Inter Miami are three points clear at the top of the Eastern Conference with a record of six wins and a draw from the seven games their best player has started. Messi seems to be in the mood. \"I don't think we will ever see anything like that again,\" said Miami's head coach Tata Martino after the game. If Messi feels like it, though, we might just.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Top Stories\n\n\ud83c\udfc1 Premier League title race going all the way: There's nothing stopping Arsenal and Manchester City in England right now.

Messi's career has been broken down into four sections categorising his stats and achievements at Barcelona, PSG, Inter Miami, and Argentina. The footballing icon has achieved glory in every team he's played with, despite some early career struggles with Argentina.\n\nFor many, Lionel Messi is the greatest footballer to have ever played the game. With a record eight Ballon d'Ors to his name, countless club records, and a World Cup under his belt, the evidence is all there.\n\nHe might be forever compared with Cristiano Ronaldo, but the Argentine is the undoubted superior player in many areas. One such factor to consider is his ability to pick up assists as well as regularly finding the back of the net.\n\nIn fact, across all competitions for club and for country, Messi has a combined total of 1243 goals and assists (at time of writing). He is the first player in football history to have surpassed the 1200 mark.\n\nWith that being the case, it feels like a good time to consider his achievements. And so, his career has been broken down into four sections - his three clubs and international career - with all of his key stats tabled up for every season he's played.\n\nRelated Top 11 Goalscorers in Football History (Ranked) Football has produced some of the best athletes the world has ever seen over the years, but who have been the most prolific in front of the net? Barcelona 2004 - 2021\n\nMessi's time at Barcelona famously started with a contract signed on a napkin, growth hormones and a fair bit of homesickness. However, by the age of 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, he got his first opportunity at senior level, making his debut in a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003. The Argentine would play nine times that season, scoring one goal - which just so happened to be assisted by Brazilian superstar Ronaldinho.\n\nOver the next few seasons, his talent would become obvious to the world outside of Barcelona and he would go supernova in 2008/09. With 38 goals and 19 assists, Messi would lead his team to a treble which included a brace in the Champions League final - he would pick up his first Ballon d'Or that year as well.\n\nHis best calendar year was in 2012 when he scored a world-record 91 goals for club and country. The footballing magician would score at least 40 goals for Barcelona every season between 2009/10 and 2018/19 but there would be a bit of a drop off in his final two campaigns.\n\nEven so, in those last two seasons, Messi would still bag 30 goals and reach double digits for assists, showing just how incredible he was for the Catalan giants. He would depart in 2021 largely due to the club's financial issues, having scored more goals (672) for Barcelona than any other player in their history.\n\nLionel Messi at Barcelona\n\nSeason\n\nGames\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nHonours\n\n2004/05\n\n9\n\n1\n\n0\n\nLa Liga\n\n2005/06\n\n25\n\n8\n\n5\n\nLa Liga, Champions League\n\n2006/07\n\n36\n\n17\n\n3\n\nSupercopa de Espana\n\n2007/08\n\n40\n\n16\n\n16\n\nNone\n\n2008/09\n\n51\n\n38\n\n19\n\nLa Liga, Champions League, Copa del Rey\n\n2009/10\n\n53\n\n47\n\n12\n\nLa Liga, Supercopa de Espana, Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup\n\n2010/11\n\n55\n\n53\n\n27\n\nLa Liga, Champions League, Supercopa de Espana\n\n2011/12\n\n60\n\n73\n\n32\n\nCopa del Rey, Supercopa de Espana, Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup\n\n2012/13\n\n50\n\n60\n\n17\n\nLa Liga\n\n2013/14\n\n46\n\n41\n\n14\n\nSupercopa de Espana\n\n2014/15\n\n57\n\n58\n\n31\n\nLa Liga, Champions League, Copa del Rey\n\n2015/16\n\n49\n\n41\n\n24\n\nLa Liga, Copa del Rey, Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup\n\n2016/17\n\n52\n\n54\n\n20\n\nCopa del Rey, Supercopa de Espana\n\n2017/18\n\n54\n\n45\n\n20\n\nLa Liga, Copa del Rey\n\n2018/19\n\n50\n\n51\n\n22\n\nLa Liga, Supercopa de Espana\n\n2019/20\n\n44\n\n31\n\n27\n\nNone\n\n2020/21\n\n47\n\n38\n\n14\n\nCopa del Rey\n\nTotal:\n\n778\n\n672\n\n303\n\n34\n\nParis Saint-Germain 2021 - 2023\n\nHaving left the club he loved, Messi didn't ever quite seem happy in France and struggled to settle at Paris Saint-Germain. Indeed, in his debut campaign, he managed just 26 goal contributions - which were his worst numbers since 2006/07 when he was still a teenager.\n\nBut with 41 goals and assists in 41 games the following season, playing alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, the ageing superstar looked back to his best. Perhaps he was inspired by the fact that it was a World Cup year. Mid-way through that term, club football was put on hold as the best international teams travelled to Qatar for the game's most prestigious tournament.\n\nMessi, of course, returned to Paris as a World Cup winner. Having essentially completed football by this stage, the Argentine would head off to America at the end of the 2022/23 European season. And while he didn't have the best time at PSG, he still won Ligue 1 twice.\n\nLionel Messi at Paris Saint-Germain\n\nSeason\n\nGames\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nHonours\n\n2021/22\n\n34\n\n11\n\n15\n\nLigue 1\n\n2022/23\n\n41\n\n21\n\n20\n\nLigue 1, Trophee des Champions\n\nTotal\n\n75\n\n32\n\n35\n\n3\n\nInter Miami 2023 - Present\n\nNow in his mid-30s, Messi would take America by storm. He'd score 11 goals and 5 assists in his first 14 games for Inter Miami. He would also pick up his record eighth Ballon d'Or win, becoming the first MLS-based player to claim the coveted prize, although the award was given largely due to his success at the World Cup.\n\nFormer Barcelona teammates Jordi Alba, Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets would then join him in Florida. Despite being 36, it's clear that Messi is still one of the best players in the world even now. In May 2024, he even managed an MLS record, becoming the first player to manage assists five times in one game, proving he's not quite put his feet up just yet.\n\nLionel Messi at Inter Miami\n\nSeason\n\nGames\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nHonours\n\n2023\n\n14\n\n11\n\n5\n\nLeagues Cup\n\n2024*\n\n11\n\n12\n\n11\n\nNone\n\nTotal\n\n25\n\n23\n\n16\n\n1\n\n*Ongoing\n\nArgentina 2005 - Present\n\nIt's funny to think that for quite some time many were unconvinced by Messi as a footballer for Argentina. Sure, he'd achieved great things with Barcelona, but having left his country while still just 13 years of age, was his heart truly with La Albiceleste?\n\nHis national team career got off to an inauspicious start too as he picked up a red card against Hungary on debut as an 18-year-old. Living in the shadow of the iconic Diego Maradona, many years of frustration would follow for Messi.\n\nArgentina would lose the 2014 World Cup final, as well as three Copa America finals in 2007, 2015, and 2016. Eventually, though - after a few early retirements which were later taken back - the Rosario-born star would end his international trophy drought in 2021.\n\nRelated 10 Greatest Argentine Players in Football History [Ranked] From Lionel Messi to Diego Maradona, Argentina have time and again produced true greats of the game.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Messi's greatest calendar year with Argentina came in 2022 when he scored 18 goals and picked up 6 assists in 14 total games. He also won the World Cup.\n\nScoring four times and picking up five assists in seven games, Messi would captain his side to glory at Copa America. And this would prove to be the perfect warm-up for Qatar less than a year later. The iconic number 10 would prove to be the best player at the World Cup, scoring in all but one of the games (seven goals and three assists in seven games) as his nation would lift the famous golden trophy for just the third time, and the first time since Maradona did so in 1986.\n\nLionel Messi at

Lionel Messi's goal against the New York Red Bulls brought his total up to 10 on the season. Ironically, he is joined at the top of that chart by teammate Luis Suarez, who secured a hat trick against New York on Saturday.\n\nYes, it is still early in the 2024 MLS season. Yet, there is a chance Lionel Messi will usurp that single-season scoring record in Major League Soccer. Currently, the high mark belongs to Carlos Vela. The Mexican scored 34 goals in the 2019 MLS Season, doing so in 31 MLS games with LAFC. After 12 games in that season, Vela had 13 goals, so he was ahead of the pace Messi is currently on. However, the Argentine has missed four games. Effectively, he is on just over a goal-per-game ratio. In terms of numbers, Messi is scoring 1.25 goals per game, while Vela's record-breaking season was 1.1 goals per game. That is a slim, arguably marginal difference. However, the pace would be enough for Messi to break the record, assuming he plays enough games.\n\nIn that lies the challenge for Messi and Inter Miami this season. There are no guarantees surrounding how many games Lionel Messi will play in the pink kit of the Florida club. There are several arguments that say as soon as Inter Miami clinches a playoff spot, it should begin to cut Messi's minutes to ensure he is fit for the playoffs. He has already missed four games this season. Officially, one of those was for rest, but the other three that followed were connected to ever-present muscular problems.\n\nBased on his current ratio, Messi would need to play in 28 MLS games to break Vela's record and score 35 goals in one MLS season. That assumes he can maintain this remarkable pace, too. It will likely simmer down, but Carlos Vela was a consistent goal-scorer throughout the 2019 MLS campaign. Based on his early success, health may be Messi's biggest opponent in regard to the record.\n\nIf Lionel Messi does not break the goal-scoring record in MLS, there is still the potential for other records for Messi. For example, he is already setting the standard in MLS for the future. Through eight games this season, Messi broke several records, some of which were single-game records.\n\nLooking back to the 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls, Messi set the single-game mark for both goal contributions and assists. His five-assist performance at the weekend was the most in MLS history. Combine those with his goal, and no other MLS player has contributed six goals in one game. It was also the sixth game in a row for Messi to amass multiple goal contributions. In his last four games, Messi has contributed 14 goals with the Argentine scoring six and assisting eight in that span.\n\nIn total, he has 22 goal contributions through eight games played in MLS. That is a record for eight games in MLS history, with Miami benefiting greatly. It leads the MLS Eastern Conference with 24 points through 12 games. Moreover, Miami is unbeaten when Messi plays in MLS this season.\n\nGoal contributions are hard to nail down. One assist may be far more impressive than another, much like some goals are penalties and some are world-class efforts. Regardless, MLS attributed five assists to Messi, and that put him atop the MLS assist chart. With 10 assists to go along with his 10 goals, Messi is on track to break the single-season assist record, too. Carlos Valderrama holds that record with 26 assists in 2000. Again, Messi's current pace would be enough to break that record.

Based on his early success, health may be Messi's biggest opponent in regard to the record.\n\nIf Lionel Messi does not break the goal-scoring record in MLS, there is still the potential for other records for Messi. For example, he is already setting the standard in MLS for the future. Through eight games this season, Messi broke several records, some of which were single-game records.\n\nLooking back to the 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls, Messi set the single-game mark for both goal contributions and assists. His five-assist performance at the weekend was the most in MLS history. Combine those with his goal, and no other MLS player has contributed six goals in one game. It was also the sixth game in a row for Messi to amass multiple goal contributions. In his last four games, Messi has contributed 14 goals with the Argentine scoring six and assisting eight in that span.\n\nIn total, he has 22 goal contributions through eight games played in MLS. That is a record for eight games in MLS history, with Miami benefiting greatly. It leads the MLS Eastern Conference with 24 points through 12 games. Moreover, Miami is unbeaten when Messi plays in MLS this season.\n\nGoal contributions are hard to nail down. One assist may be far more impressive than another, much like some goals are penalties and some are world-class efforts. Regardless, MLS attributed five assists to Messi, and that put him atop the MLS assist chart. With 10 assists to go along with his 10 goals, Messi is on track to break the single-season assist record, too. Carlos Valderrama holds that record with 26 assists in 2000. Again, Messi's current pace would be enough to break that record. It simply comes down to how available Messi is with Inter Miami.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Vela", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Vela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Valderrama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Valderrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240506_WST_505327_Messi-MLS-goal-scoring-record.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535003", "eventUri": "eng-9535003", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452708644, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 161, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 161}}}

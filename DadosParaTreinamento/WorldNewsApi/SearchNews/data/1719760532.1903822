{"id": 225002652, "title": "Pubgoers 'appalled' after nudist couple enjoy dinner and drinks totally naked", "text": "Pubgoers were left shocked and appalled after a naked couple wandered into a bar to enjoy a meal completely in the buff. The Railway in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, was full of \"outraged\" customers when Neil Cox and Danielle Quiggan popped in for some food and drink one evening last June. Patrons, including families with children, were stunned when the couple were promptly seated by staff - with some even deciding to leave the pub rather than associate with the naturists, Somerset Live reports. The surprising turn of events led to a flurry of complaints on Tripadvisor after punters headed online to vent about their experience. Margaret Lishmund, who left The Railway after spotting the couple, questioned the bar's \"family values\". She wrote: \"We visited the pub to have dinner. Whilst ordering drinks a couple walked up to the bar naked which was a shock for all in the pub. We expected the bar man to refuse to serve them. \"There were several families with children in the pub, including ourselves, therefore it was not appropriate for them to be served. We decided to leave the pub and find somewhere else for dinner in town. \"Unfortunately, another family were not able to as they had already ordered food. If you advertise as a family pub you should maintain these values. Locals who frequent the pub apologised to us, but the staff seemed to think this was okay. Very disappointing.\" Sarah L, who was at the pub with her mum and dad, wrote: \"Appalling. If you want to go to a family pub with average food and staff serving a naked man accompanied by a naked woman then this is for you. Took parents. Outraged.\" Reviewer Euroexp123 said: \"We found food and staff pleasant. We went for the second time last night, we were shocked to see a naked couple arrive and be served. \"We were concerned as there were families and young children there. I heard one customer mention this to the staff. As other people have said, staff seemed unconcerned. We will not be going again.\" Neil, 35, has been a naturist for several years and said that he and Danielle, 36, called ahead to let The Railway know about their lifestyle choice when making the booking. Staff at the bar researched naturism rules before accepting the booking, treating it as a \"learning experience.\" Neil, from Cheshire, and Danielle, from London, had been in Bristol and were on their way for a weekend break in Cornwall when they made the pitstop. The nudist said: \"During our break away we were naked most of the time. \"Where I live there are shops, grocery stores and pubs where I go in regularly that accept I am a naturist. We don't think the reaction on Tripadvisor was reflective of what actually happened in the pub in Burnham-on-Sea. \"It was a new place and people were not expecting it and there was an element of surprise when we first walked in. We sat in the corner of the pub and had our meal. People quickly went back to their drinks and got on with their day.\" \"After all, two naked people sitting in a corner of a pub having a beer and burger quickly becomes boring. Several people came over to us whilst we were there to have a chat and ask questions or request a photo. We had checked with the pub first and got their permission to visit.\" Hitting back at the negative responses, Neil said: \"I've made over 500 visits to shops, bars and other businesses whilst naked and as far as I'm aware not one of those visits has ever resulted in a single negative review. Danielle and I find it deeply saddening that an individual has attacked a small business that is trying to demonstrate acceptance and tolerance.\" Being naked in public isn't against the law. While many naturists keep their activities to designated areas or places with a tradition of nudity, like certain beaches, some enjoy their lifestyle choice more widely. Current guidelines from the Crown Prosecution Service reads: \"In the case of naturism a balance needs to be struck between the naturist's right to freedom of expression and the right of the wider public to be protected from harassment, alarm and distress. \"In the absence of any sexual context and in relation to nudity, where the person has no intention to cause alarm or distress, it will normally be appropriate to take no action unless members of the public were actually caused harassment, alarm or distress.\" A spokesperson for the Railway Inn said: \"We have received both negative and positive comments which we have taken on board, however naturism is legal within the UK and we pride ourselves on inclusivity and welcome everyone's individuality and differences.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

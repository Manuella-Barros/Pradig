(Photo by John Adams/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Icon Sportswire via Getty Images EA released the Top 25 teams in College Football 25 on Friday, and surprisingly, it's not a complete match to the ESPN Power Index. The Top 5 teams are the same on both lists, but the two entities only agree on the top school in the nation. Here is a look at the Top 25 teams in College Football 25. Georgia - 95 OVR Ohio State - 93 OVR Oregon - 93 OVR Alabama - 92 OVR Texas - 92 OVR Clemson - 90 OVR Notre Dame - 90 OVR LSU - 90 OVR Penn State - 88 OVR Utah - 88 OVR Michigan - 88 OVR Florida State - 88 OVR Miami - 88 OVR Texas A&M - 88 OVR Ole Miss - 88 OVR Colorado - 87 OVR Oklahoma - 87 OVR Wisconsin - 87 OVR USC - 87 OVR Virginia Tech - 87 OVR NC State - 87 OVR Kansas - 87 OVR Arizona - 87 OVR Oklahoma State - 87 OVR Iowa - 87 OVR Both EA and ESPN have the Georgia Bulldogs as the No. 1 team. EA has Oregon at No. 3, but ESPN has the Ducks at No. 2. The Ohio State is ranked No. 4 by ESPN, but No. 2 on EA's rankings. Here is a look at the way ESPN ranks the Top 25 schools according to Power Index: Georgia Bulldogs Oregon Ducks Texas Longhorns Ohio State Buckeyes Alabama Crimson Tide Penn State Nittany Lions Notre Dame Fighting Irish Oklahoma Sooners Tennessee Volunteers Missouri Tigers Florida State Seminoles Michigan Wolverines LSU Tigers Texas A&M Aggies Clemson Tigers Ole Miss Rebels Kansas Jayhawks USC Trojans Auburn Tigers Florida Gators Louisville Cardinals Kansas State Wildcats Miami Hurricanes Arizona Wildcats SMU Mustangs The biggest question regarding the team ratings is whether we will see player and team ratings change during the season. EA has yet to share any definitive language that confirms we will see player ratings or team rankings adjustments. However, it would seem like a major missed opportunity to be a part of the college football conversation if the game doesn't do its rankings every week. Forbes VettedFor You The Best Gaming Mouse That\u2019ll Improve Your Aim By Jon Martindale Contributor That same concept would extend to player ratings adjustments\u2013especially for the top stars who may be vying for the Heisman Trophy and other awards. If the ratings and rankings have continuity with real-life college football, fans will focus on key dates throughout the season. Check out August 24 when Florida State goes on the road to take on ACC rival Georgia Tech. The Seminoles will be the first-ranked team to take the field this season. Thus, they will be the first squad in a position to prove themselves or become the victims of a massive upset. The Yellow Jackets sit at 54th on ESPN's Power Index, so we should expect to see DJ Uiagalelei and Co. have a solid opening to their season. I hope we see highlight reels from the week's best performers on some posts from the College Football 25's official X and TikTok accounts. The anticipation of the return of college football to the video game world was already high; let's hope EA dives head first into the hype and experience all season long. College Football 25 will release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Follow me on Twitter.

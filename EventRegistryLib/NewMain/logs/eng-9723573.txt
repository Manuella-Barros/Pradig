All of a sudden, you're in a different group.'\n\nIMAGE: Mitchell Starc also hit back at the Australian team management for dropping him from the game against Afghanistan. Photograph: Ash Allen/Reuters\n\nAustralian pacer Mitchell Starc has expressed his displeasure at being dropped for the crucial T20 World Cup Super Eights match against Afghanistan in the Caribbean, saying he was not one bit amused by the team management's decision.\n\nThe 2021 T20 World Cup champions suffered a shocking 21-run loss to Afghanistan, which dealt a massive blow to Australia's chances of entering the semifinals.\n\nAustralia had replaced Starc with Ashton Agar for the match but the left-arm spinner, despite tying down the Afghanistan batters, could not take any wickets.\n\n\"No -- two World Cups in a row,\" Starc was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald on Willow Talk podcast when quizzed about his omission and whether he was amused by the decision.\n\n\"Just the match-up, they (team management) saw previous games on that ground in St Vincent with spin playing a part and obviously Ash (Ashton) and the left-armer enticing them to make a change,\" he added.\n\nThis was the second occasion in a row where the Australian pacer was dropped for a T20 World Cup match against Afghanistan, with the previous one being in Adelaide in 2022 where also the hosts failed to reach the last four stage.\n\nAgar and the two Australian pace spearheads, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, were unable to break the partnership between openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran, who ended up making 118 runs.\n\n\"I think Ash bowled pretty well in the powerplay. They probably played the spin quite well and batting first probably assessed the conditions a little bit better than we did, and had a couple of stumbles that in the end cost us the game,\" said Starc.\n\n\"It was probably the fielding that cost us again that game. That meant we had to win against India and we fell short there as well.\"\n\nAustralia then went on to lose to India in Super Eights and were later eliminated from the competition.\n\nStarc also expressed his displeasure with the scheduling of the tournament and pre-seeding that saw them advance to the pre-determined group despite topping the group stage.\n\n\"We finished ahead of England (in the group stage) and end up where we were pre-seeded as the second side. All of a sudden, you're in a different group.\"\n\n\"The argument was it was because it was so hard to get around the West Indies, so fans knew where your team was playing.\n\n\"So then why don't you have the chock-a-block tournament at the front... and then spread it out at the back end? We had the two night games and the third was a day game, so it wasn't the best preparation. We had a delayed flight out of St Vincent, it was a 90-minute drive from the airport to the hotel in St Lucia, and then we had a 10 o'clock toss.\n\nHe added that the travelling between venues in the West Indies is always difficult.\n\n\"I think that was probably maybe a misread [by organisers], the fact that the front half of the tournament was more spread out, and then you hit the super eights

Starc's exclusion marked the second consecutive World Cup game against Afghanistan he has missed, a trend that has fueled his frustration.\n\nAustralia opted to replace Starc with left-arm spinner Ashton Agar for the match.Agar managed to contain the Afghan batters but failed to take any wickets, a strategic choice that did not yield the desired results. Starc, speaking on the Willow Talk podcast, voiced his disappointment about being dropped.\n\n\"No -- two World Cups in a row,\" Starc was quoted as saying by PTI, referring to his exclusion from matches against Afghanistan in consecutive tournaments.\n\nThe decision to leave out Starc was influenced by previous games on the same ground in St Vincent, where spin had played a significant role. Starc explained the management's perspective on the change.\n\n\"They saw previous games on that ground with spin playing a part and obviously Ash and the left-armer enticing them to make a change,\" Starc explained.\n\nThis was not the first instance Starc had been sidelined for a match against Afghanistan in a T20 World Cup. In 2022, he was also omitted for a game in Adelaide, which similarly led to Australia failing to progress to the semifinals.\n\nAustralia subsequently lost to India in the Super Eights, leading to their elimination from the competition. Starc also criticized the tournament's scheduling and pre-seeding arrangements, which placed Australia in a predetermined group despite topping the group stage.\n\n\"We finished ahead of England and end up where we were pre-seeded as the second side. All of a sudden, you're in a different group,\" he remarked.\n\nHe further discussed the logistical challenges of traveling in the West Indies, suggesting that the tournament's structure could have been better planned.\n\n\"We had the two night games and the third was a day game, so it wasn't the best preparation. We had a delayed flight out of St Vincent, a 90-minute drive from the airport to the hotel in St Lucia, and then a 10 o'clock toss,\" Starc said.\n\nHe concluded by acknowledging the difficulties of traveling between venues in the Caribbean.\n\n\"Travel around the West Indies is probably not the easiest thing to do, certainly not to travel home from,\" he noted.\n\nAustralia's early exit from the T20 World Cup has sparked discussions about team selection and tournament logistics, with Starc's comments adding fuel to the debate.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Spin-bowling all-rounder Ashton Agar was brought into the side instead of him.\n\n\"No - two World Cups in a row (on being dropped for the games against Afghanistan, including one during 2022 T20 WC). Just the match-up, they saw previous games on that ground in St Vincent with spin playing a part and obviously Ash (Ashton Agar) and the left-armer enticing them to make a change. I think Ash bowled pretty well in the power play. They (Afghanistan) probably played the spin quite well and batting first probably assessed the conditions a little bit better than we did, and had a couple of stumbles that in the end cost us the game,\" said Starc.\n\nSpeaking of whether he will play in the 2026 T20 WC, which will be hosted by India and Sri Lanka, Starc expressed some uncertainty regarding his future in T20Is.\n\n\"I do not know, probably I will sit on the fence on that,\" he said.\n\nStarc has represented Australia in 65 T20Is since his debut in the format in 2012, taking 79 wickets at an average of 23.81, with the best figures of 4/20.\n\nThe defeat against Afghanistan, followed by a big loss to India, sent Australia packing out of the tournament. Their elimination was fully confirmed as Afghanistan beat Bangladesh to book their semifinal spot, along with India from Super Eights Group one.\n\nSpeaking about being hit for 29 runs by Indian skipper Rohit Sharma during the Super Eights stage, including four big sixes, Starc said, \"I have played lot against Rohit, he had a great tournament, especially backend, he targeted the wind, I had 5 bad balls and he hit all for sixes.\"\n\nThe Australian quick was also critical of the pre-seeding during the Super Eights stage, which meant Australia was given the B2 position in Super Eights stage despite being the table toppers in league stage Group B. England, which finished at second spot in Group B, was pre-allocated the B1 position in Super Eights and they were in the Group two of Super Eights alongside South Africa, West Indies and Bangladesh.\n\nStarc was critical of the logistics and pre-seedings, saying, \"We finished ahead of England and end up where we were pre-seeded as the second side. All of a sudden, you are in a different group. The argument was it was because it was so hard to get around the West Indies, so fans knew where your team was playing.\"\n\n\"So then why do not you have the chock-a-block tournament at the front ... and then spread it out at the back end? We had the two night games and the third was a day game, so it was not the best preparation. We had a delayed flight out of St Vincent, it was a 90-minute drive from the airport to the hotel in St Lucia, and then we had a 10 o'clock,\" Starc added.\n\nOn travelling through Caribbean, the pacer said, \"Travel around the West Indies is probably not the easiest thing to do, certainly not to travel home from.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "aninews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asian

Mitchell Starc stated that the decision might have been influenced by the pitch conditions favoring spin bowling in Kingstown.\n\nAustralia decided to omit Mitchell Starc from the Super 8 match against Afghanistan. The Australia team management picked left-arm spinner Ashton Agar, who bowled economically but struggled to take wickets. The 2021 T20 World champions lost the match by 21 runs while chasing a target of 148 in Kingstown.\n\nThe Mitchell Marsh-led team then lost to eventual champions India in their final Super Eight match. The Australian team suffered elimination from the tournament without reaching the semifinal stage. Notably, Australia also failed to reach the top four stage in the 2022 edition of the tournament on home soil.\n\nSpeaking on the Willow Talk podcast, Mitchell Starc attributed Australia's loss to their own mistakes in fielding and batting. Starc emphasized that Afghanistan assessed the conditions better, which led to Australia's defeat in the match.\n\n\"No - two World Cups in a row. Just the match-up, they saw previous games on that ground in St Vincent with spin playing a part and obviously Ash and the left-arm enticing them to make a change. I think Ash bowled pretty well in the power play. They probably played the spin quite well and batting first probably assessed the conditions a little bit better than we did and had a couple of stumbles that in the end cost us the game,\" Starc said.\n\nAustralia's team management rotated their bowlers throughout the ICC tournament. Starc picked up five wickets in five matches at an average of 31.60 and an economy rate of 8.78, with his best bowling figures being 2/20. He conceded 45 runs in his four overs during the match against the Rohit Sharma-led team.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Australia won both the ODI World Cup in 2023 and the World Test Championship (WTC) final last year under the leadership of Pat Cummins. Mitchell Starc played a crucial role in both victories as a member of the Australian team.\n\nMitchell Starc expressed frustration about Australia's scheduling and preparation issues during the T20 World Cup. He mentioned that pre-seeding affected their preparation due to logistical challenges such as delayed flights and long travel times between venues.\n\n\"We finished ahead of England and end up where we were pre-seeded as the second side. All of a sudden, you're in a different group. The argument was it was because it was so hard to get around the West Indies, so fans knew where your team was playing.\"\n\n\"So then why don't you have the chock-a-block tournament at the front ... and then spread it out at the back end? We had the two night games and the third was a day game, so it wasn't the best preparation.\"\n\nMitchell Starc is expected to play for Australia in their upcoming series against England in September. The series between England and Australia will consist of three T20I matches scheduled from September 11 to 15. The five-match ODI series will be played from September 19 to 29.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Starc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingstown", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Agar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashton Agar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC World Test Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Mitchell%20Starc%20Pat%20Cummins%20Mitchell%20Marsh.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723573", "eventUri": "eng-9723573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-11", "dateEnd": "-09-15", "textStart": 3095, "textEnd": 3113}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-19", "dateEnd": "-09-29", "textStart": 3161, "textEnd": 3179}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Notably, Starc was benched to make way for Ashton Agar in Australia's second Super 8 game. The left-arm spinner did a good job of containing the batters in the middle overs giving away just 17 runs in four overs.\n\nHowever, Australia ended up losing the match by 21 runs which became one of the major reasons behind their early ouster from the tournament. It was the second consecutive time that Starc was left out of the playing XI against Afghanistan. Earlier, the 34-year-old was also benched in the group fixture against the same team in the 2022 T20 World Cup.\n\nSpeaking on his exclusion, the 2021 World Cup winner recently revealed that the team management went ahead with the spinner with the conditions favouring him.\n\n\"No -- two World Cups in a row. They saw previous games on that ground with spin playing a part and obviously Ash and the left-armer enticing them to make a change,\" Starc said on the WillowTalk podcast.\n\nFurther speaking ahead, Starc criticized the pre-tournament seedings and the scheduling of the super 8 stages for the event.\n\n\"We finished ahead of England and end up where we were pre-seeded as the second side. All of a sudden, you're in a different group. We had the two night games and the third was a day game, so it wasn't the best preparation.

While Starc himself was a talking point after being dropped for a crucial match, his main concern lies with the logistical nightmare teams faced during the Super Eights stage.\n\nMitchell Starc, a key member of Australia's white-ball team, expressed his frustration with the constant travel between islands and the inconsistency of match timings. \"It wasn't ideal preparation,\" he stated on the Willow Talk podcast.\n\nHe described hopping between Caribbean islands every other day, playing matches under vastly different conditions - some mornings, some evenings. \"Two night games and the third a day game,\" he said, highlighting the disruption to player routines.\n\nThe 34-year-old bowler wasn't shy about questioning the ICC's reasoning behind the schedule. The pre-determined seedings for the Super Eights, coupled with points from the group stage being irrelevant, created a bizarre situation. Australia found themselves needing to potentially lose a match to benefit their chances later in the tournament - hardly a recipe for focused, competitive cricket.\n\nMitchell Starc pointed out the inconsistency: \"We finished ahead of England, yet ended up in a different group.\" He suggested a more logical approach: \"Why not have the bulk of the tournament at the beginning, then spread things out later?\"\n\nWhile Starc's comments may be fuelled by his disappointment at being dropped for the crucial Afghanistan match, they raise valid concerns about player well-being and fair competition.

However, the decision to exclude Starc from the XI baffled many, especially given his proven effectiveness and reliability during clutch moments.\n\nStarc recently broached the subject in a discussion, alluding to the fact that he had been dropped in two consecutive T20 World Cups (referencing a similar exclusion against the same opposition in the 2022 edition). He appeared visibly displeased and proceeded to elucidate the rationale behind his substitution by Ashton Agar for the match on June 22, 2024. He explained that the spin-friendly conditions at the Arnos Vale Ground, combined with Agar being a left-arm spinner, were the primary factors influencing the decision.\n\nAlso Read: 'I want us to go out to Australia and win it back' - Ben Stokes determined for Ashes redemption\n\n\"No - two World Cups in a row. Just the match-up, they (team management) saw previous games on that ground in St. Vincent with spin playing a part and obviously Ash (Ashton) and the left-armer enticing them to make a change,\" stated Starc on the Willow Talk podcast, as quoted by Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nAgar ultimately emerged as the most economical bowler for his side during the match, maintaining an impressive economy rate of just 4.25 runs per over. Referring to the left-arm spinner's initial spell during the powerplay, where he conceded a mere two runs in his first two overs, Starc remarked that Afghanistan adapted to the conditions better than Australia. He noted that a few stumbles and collapses towards the end cost the Aussies the game.\n\nHowever, Starc emphasized that what truly cost Australia the match were their fielding lapses, including five dropped catches, three missed run-out opportunities, and a botched stumping chance. This meant the game against India was a virtual quarter-final for them, in which they ultimately fell short by 24 runs.\n\nAlso Read: Winning in Australia gave me renewed energy to come back to Test cricket: Jason Holder\n\n\"I think Ash (Ashton Agar) bowled pretty well in the powerplay. They probably played spin quite well and batting first probably assessed the conditions a little bit better than we did, and had a couple of stumbles that in the end cost us the game. It was probably the fielding that cost us again that game. That meant we had to win against India and we fell short there as well,\" added Starc.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Starc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Agar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ashton Agar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Namibia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnos_Vale_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnos Vale Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ashes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumped", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stumped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sydney Morning Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1718709137241_Mitrchell-Starc.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723573", "eventUri": "eng-9723573", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The left-arm pacer was a part of Australia's squad for the recently concluded T20 World Cup, held in the USA and the West Indies.\n\nMitchell Starc played in 5 of the 7 games that Australia played in the competition last month. In those 5 games, he picked up 5 wickets although he could not help Australia qualify for the semifinals. The Australian team management had decided against including him in the playing eleven for the crucial Super 8 clash against Afghanistan.\n\nIn his absence, Australia suffered a shock loss and eventually bowed out of the tournament. The veteran pacer will be almost 37 when the next T20 World Cup takes place in 2026. He was recently asked whether he would be available for that tournament or not.\n\nIn reply, the World Cup-winning pacer said that he has not made his decision yet.\n\n\"I don't know, probably I'll sit on the fence on that. I have not made my decision yet,\" said Mitchell Starch on the Willow Talk podcast.\n\nStarc, who made his debut for Australia in 2010, has played 65 T20Is so far and has picked up 79 wickets. He was also a part of the Australian team that won the T20 World Cup in 2021. Before this year's World Cup, he had also played a starring role in Kolkata Knight Riders' triumphant campaign in IPL 2024.\n\nDuring the same podcast, Mitchell Starc also opened up on his axing for the game against Afghanistan. He was also dropped for Australia's game against Afghanistan in the 2022 T20 World Cup. On that occasion, Kane Richardson was preferred ahead of him.\n\nRichardson had conceded 48 runs in 4 overs although Australia managed to win the game by a narrow margin of four runs. However, they failed to cross the finishing line in last month's T20 World Cup and paid a huge price for it as they could not make the cut for the semifinals.\n\n\"Two World Cups in a row,\" said Starc before adding: \"Just the match-up, they saw previous games on that ground in St Vincent with spin playing a part and obviously Ash and the left-armer enticing them to make a change.\"", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Starc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kane Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/MitchellStarcinCWC2023.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723573", "eventUri": "eng-9723573", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Indian skipper scored 92 runs off 41 balls, including seven boundaries and eight sixes. Rohit Sharma was named \"Player of the Match\" after defeating the Mitchell Marsh-led team by 24 runs.\n\nThe 37-year-old showed an aggressive approach despite Virat Kohli's dismissal without scoring in the second over. Rohit changed the match in India's favor by registering 29 runs off Mitchell Starc. The right-handed batter smashed Starc with four sixes and two boundaries in the third over, which also included a wide.\n\nThe veteran opener hit three consecutive sixes off the first three deliveries. He smashed back-to-back fours at mid-on and mid-wicket. Mitchell Starc bowled a dot ball on the fifth delivery followed by a wide. Rohit finished the over by hitting another six at third man off a full toss on the final ball of the over.\n\nThe left-arm fast bowler conceded 45 runs in his four overs in the match against the Rohit Sharma-led team. Overall, his performance in the tournament was lackluster, managing only five wickets from five matches at an average of 31.60 and an economy rate of 8.78 with his best bowling figures were 2/20.\n\nTalking on LiSTNR Sport, a popular sports podcast, Mitchell Starc mentioned how Rohit Sharma used conditions to score runs. Starc stated that they conceded close to par score and described it as the best wicket Australia played on in the World Cup.\n\n\"I've played a lot against him. He had a good tournament, especially back end. I think that he targeted that wind in St Lucia as well. That was at one end, I think. If you look at the runs from each end, it was probably the one end that went for a lot more than the other. I think I had five bad balls, and he hit them all for six. We thought that it was close to par perhaps, maybe a little bit over par, but it was the best wicket in the World Cup I think, that we all played on,\" Starc said.\n\nIn the previous match, Mitchell Starc was replaced by Ashton Agar against Afghanistan. Agar performed well by conceding only 17 runs in his four overs. However, Australia lost the match by 21 runs.

Led by Rohit Sharma, India's victory in the T20 World Cup came after a remarkable display of batting prowess against Australia. Despite a strong start, Australia's exit from the tournament raised questions about their team selection. The highlight of the match was Rohit's aggressive innings, scoring 92 runs off 41 balls before being dismissed by a Starc yorker. India's win marked the end of a 17-year wait for the title, showcasing their resilience and determination on the world stage.It was a case of coming so close yet falling short, as India stumbled at the final hurdle in the ODI Cricket World Cup on November 19, 2023. The Rohit Sharma-led side looked in great form but were bowled out for 240 in the final against Australia, a total that wasn't enough to win and left the hearts of more than a billion people broken.\n\nHowever, there is always a next time in sports and life, as demonstrated during India's T20 World Cup campaign. The men in blue avenged past losses against Australia and England, finally lifting the trophy to achieve redemption. It was a captain's knock in the final, showcasing the very best of Rohit Sharma, who launched a ferocious attack on Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc during their Super 8 clash in St Lucia, leaving onlookers astounded by his exceptional batting prowess.\n\nFacing off against the left-arm speedster, the Indian captain completely dominated the Australian pacer, amassing a remarkable 29 runs.\n\nDuring Starc's over, Rohit effortlessly showcased his ability to clear the boundaries, smashing 4 sixes and a four. The over also included a wide and a dot ball.\n\nReflecting on the T20 World Cup match against India during a recent appearance on the LiSTNR Sport podcast, Starc remarked, \"I've played against him (Rohit) a lot. He had a fantastic tournament, especially towards the end. I think he targeted the wind in St. Lucia as well. There was one end where we leaked a lot of runs, and I happened to bowl from that very end (laughs). I bowled 5 bad balls and he dispatched all of them for sixes (four sixes and one four).\"\n\n\"That was the highest-scoring wicket throughout the World Cup. It was probably the fastest wicket across the West Indies. We were chasing for a while, but a few setbacks and some quality bowling from them set us back,\" he added.\n\nHere's the video:\n\nLater in the game, Starc managed to dismiss Rohit with a yorker that shattered his stumps.\n\nDespite this breakthrough, Rohit had already inflicted significant damage, scoring an impressive 92 runs off just 41 deliveries, earning his 'Hitman' nickname.\n\nIndia eventually went on to win the T20 World Cup, ending their 17-year wait for the title.

And Rohit's contributions cannot be aptly summed up without the mention of his 92-run knock against Australia in India's Super Eight game at St. Lucia. Against the reigning ODI World Champions, the Indian captain batted like a man possesses, almost as if the wounds of November 19 were still fresh in his mind. Rohit struck seven fours and eight sixes - four of which came in one Mitchell Starc over - that set the tempo for India's strong finish of 205/5.\n\nRohit followed it with another crucial fifty against England in the next game - the semi-final - but the skipper's hammering of Australia could well have been the knock of the tournament. And that it came against a bowler of Starc's calibre is what makes Rohit's innings extra special. India were 6/1 after two overs, before Rohit's carnage opened the floodgates as Australia fell short by 24 runs and eventually crashed out following a loss to Afghanistan. Opening up on that harrowing over, Starc revealed that Rohit took advantage of the wind factor, but at the same time had no shame admitting that he bowled poorly to the India captain.\n\n\"I've played a lot against him. He had a good tournament, especially in our game. I think he targetted that wind in St. Lucia as well. If you look at the runs from each end, one end went for a lot more than the other. I bowled from that end. I bowled five bad balls and he hit them all for six,\" the Aussie pacer said on the LiSTNR Sport podcast.\n\nRohit began the assault by smashing a couple of juicy half-volleys over extra cover before going down on one knee and depositing Starc over cow corner. Off the last ball of the over, Starc erred in length and sent down a full toss, which Rohit top-edged for a six. In between, Rohit drilled a boundary down the ground to make it 29 off the over.\n\nStarc eventually castled Rohit in his second spell, but not before getting clattered for a fifth six. As it turns out, Rohit's innings set the tempo and along with contributions from Suryakumar Yadav (31), Shivam Dube (28) and Hardik Pandya (unbeaten 27), India posted a huge target to the 2021 T20 world champions.\n\nAustralia looked on course when Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh went on a six-hitting spree, but Axar Patel's unbelievable one-handed catch near the boundary to dismiss the Aussie captain and Jasprit Bumrah's slower ball to finally send back India's nemesis Head, allowed India to close in and pick up a sweet revenge-filled victory.\n\n\"We thought it was a little bit over par, but it was the best wicket in the World Cup which we played on in terms of runs scored. It wasn't probably the quickest wicket in the West Indies but definitely the best wicket which we played on. Certainly chaseable. We were on target for a while but a couple of hiccups and some good bowling from them set us back,\" added Starc.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Starc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Lucia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Head", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Head"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Marsh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Marsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/11/1600x900/rohit-starc-getty_1720699466063_1720699478303.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723573", "eventUri": "eng-9723573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-19", "textStart": 335, "textEnd": 346}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

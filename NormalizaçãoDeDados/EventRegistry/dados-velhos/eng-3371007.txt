Stocks are now lower than in 2016.\n\nBut US oil output is rising fast as shale producers take advantage of a recent increase in prices.\n\nUS production jumped by 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.75 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016.\n\n\"The EIA data suggest the US oil market is becoming more balanced, with crude inventories falling,\" said Tamas Varga, senior market analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.\n\n\"But the big jump in production was the focus.\"\n\nRising US output has been undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers including Russia to drain a global fuel glut.\n\nThey have promised to restrict output by a total of 1.8 million bpd between January this year and March 2018.\n\nWilliam O'Loughlin at Rivkin Securities said that if inventory declines continued at the current pace, US stocks would fall below the five-year average

prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,\" he added.\n\nBrent prices are down almost 12 percent since OPEC and its allies began cutting production in January.\n\nOil producers have enjoyed years of rocketing demand, fuelled largely by China's voracious thirst coming from over 2 million new car sales a month.\n\nBut this boom is coming to an end as its vehicle sales slow in a maturing market,

Stocks are now lower than in 2016.\n\n\"If inventory declines continue at this pace, stocks will fall back below the five-year average in around two months,\" said William O'Loughlin, analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.\n\n\"The pace of the declines indicates that the OPEC production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is sceptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,\" he added.\n\nANZ bank said the market seemed \"to focus on the rise in (U.S.) production\", which jumped by 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.75 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016.\n\nThe soaring U.S. output undermines efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which, together with non-OPEC producers like Russia, has pledged to restrict output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018.\n\nBrent prices are down by almost 12 percent since the start of the cuts in January.\n\nThe subdued market sentiment also has roots on the demand side.\n\nOil producers have enjoyed years of rocketing demand, fuelled largely by China's voracious thirst coming from over 2 million new car sales a month.\n\nBut this boom is coming to an end as its vehicle sales slow in a maturing market, and as cars become more efficient and start using alternative fuels.\n\n\"Gasoline consumption growth in China is set to see a marked slowdown over the coming years, due to macroeconomic headwinds, improving fuel economy and competition from alternative fuels,\" BMI Research said.\n\n\"We forecast average annual growth of 1.3 percent over 2017-2021, compared with 9.6 percent seen over 2011-2016,\" it added.\n\nIndia, often touted as the 'next China' for oil demand growth, however, only sells around 260,000 cars per month and has not seen significant sales growth in the past years.\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "wgt": 100, "id": 22, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds"}, {"uri":

Stocks are now lower than in 2016.\n\n\"If inventory declines continue at this pace, stocks will fall back below the five-year average in around two months,\" said William O'Loughlin, analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.\n\n\"The pace of the declines indicates that the OPEC production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is sceptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,\" he added.\n\nANZ bank said the market seemed \"to focus on the rise in (U.S.) production\", which jumped by 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.75 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016. &lt;C-OUT-T-EIA>\n\nThe soaring U.S. output undermines efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which, together with non-OPEC producers like Russia, has pledged to restrict output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018.\n\nBrent prices are down by almost 12 percent since the start of the cuts in January.\n\nThe subdued market sentiment also has roots on the demand side.\n\nOil producers have enjoyed years of rocketing demand, fuelled largely by China's voracious thirst coming from over 2 million new car sales a month.\n\nBut this boom is coming to an end as its vehicle sales slow in a maturing market, and as cars become more efficient and start using alternative fuels.\n\n\"Gasoline consumption growth in China is set to see a marked slowdown over the coming years, due to macroeconomic headwinds, improving fuel economy and competition from alternative fuels,\" BMI Research said.\n\n\"We forecast average annual growth of 1.3 percent over 2017-2021, compared with 9.6 percent seen over 2011-2016,\" it added.\n\nIndia, often touted as the 'next China' for oil demand growth, however, only sells around 260,000 cars per month and has not seen significant sales growth in the past years.\n\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein;

Stocks are now lower than in 2016.\n\nU.S. oil output, however, is rising fast as shale producers take advantage of a recent increase in prices.\n\nU.S. crude production rose 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.8 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016.\n\n\"Yesterday, the production number trumped the storage number, but it was still a draw of 9 million,\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures, energy futures at Mizuho. \"There are some weaker shorts that are probably sold out and they want to get out.\"\n\nRising U.S. output has been undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia to drain a global fuel glut.\n\nThey have promised to restrict output by a total of 1.8 million bpd between January this year and March 2018.\n\nWilliam O'Loughlin at Rivkin Securities said that if inventory declines continued at the current pace, U.S. stocks would fall below the five-year average in two months.\n\n\"The pace of the declines indicates that OPEC production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is sceptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,\" he added.\n\nBrent prices are down almost 12 percent since OPEC and its allies began cutting production in January.\n\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore and Christopher Johnson in London;

U.S. light crude was 31 cents, or 0.66 percent, higher at $47.09 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday despite data showing that U.S. inventories last week fell the most in nearly a year.\n\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) data showed commercial U.S. crude stocks have fallen by almost 13 percent from their peaks in March to 466.5 million barrels. Stocks are now lower than in 2016.\n\nU.S. oil output, however, is rising fast as shale producers take advantage of a recent increase in prices.\n\nU.S. crude production rose 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.8 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016.\n\n\"Yesterday, the production number trumped the storage number, but it was still a draw of 9 million,\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures, energy futures at Mizuho. \"There are some weaker shorts that are probably sold out and they want to get out.\"\n\nRising U.S. output has been undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia to drain a global fuel glut.\n\nThey have promised to restrict output by a total of 1.8 million bpd between January this year and March 2018.\n\nWilliam O'Loughlin at Rivkin Securities said that if inventory declines continued at the current pace, U.S. stocks would fall below the five-year average in two months.\n\n\"The pace of the declines indicates that OPEC production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is sceptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,\" he added.\n\nBrent prices are down almost 12 percent since OPEC and its allies began cutting production in January.\n\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore and Christopher Johnson in London;

Brent prices are down by almost 12 percent since the start of the cuts in January. -- Reuters.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "wgt": 100, "id": 22, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "wgt": 100, "id": 38, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "wgt": 100, "id": 40, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100, "id": 45, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty", "wgt": 100, "id": 859, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199444"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302590", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302791", "label": {"eng": "Greenwich Mean Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303074", "label": {"eng": "Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303393", "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304173", "label": {"eng": "Inventory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304191", "label": {"eng": "Price of petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304665", "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305421", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "308264", "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "308346", "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309549", "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309704", "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310654", "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "338772", "label": {"eng": "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_West", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "343934", "label": {"eng": "US West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand_Banking_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "345773", "label": {"eng": "Australia and New Zealand Banking Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "477933", "label": {"eng": "Price support"}}]}

US light crude was 31 cents, or 0.66 per cent, higher at US$47.09 a barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks fell more than 1 per cent on Wednesday despite data showing that US inventories last week fell the most in nearly a year.\n\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) data showed commercial US crude stocks have fallen by almost 13 per cent from their peaks in March to 466.5 million barrels. Stocks are now lower than in 2016.\n\nUS oil output, however, is rising fast as shale producers take advantage of a recent increase in prices.\n\nUS crude production rose 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.8 per cent above the most recent low in mid-2016.\n\n\"Yesterday, the production number trumped the storage number, but it was still a draw of nine million,\" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures, energy futures at Mizuho. \"There are some weaker shorts that are probably sold out and they want to get out.\"\n\nRising US output has been undermining efforts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia to drain a global fuel glut.\n\nThey have promised to restrict output by a total of 1.8 million bpd between January this year and March 2018.\n\nWilliam O'Loughlin at Rivkin Securities said that if inventory declines continued at the current pace, US stocks would fall below the five-year average in two months.\n\n\"The pace of the declines indicates that Opec production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is sceptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,\" he added.\n\nBrent prices are down almost 12 per cent since Opec and its allies began cutting production in January. -- Reuters", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 37, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "wgt":

Brent is set for an over 2 percent drop this week.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $47.06 a barrel, down 3 cents. WTI is also set to drop for the week, down some 3.5 percent.\n\nThe dip in oil prices occurred amid a selloff across markets, including U.S. and Asian stocks, where investors voted with their feet amid growing scepticism that U.S. President Donald Trump, embroiled in controversy, would achieve his economic agenda.\n\nThe overall softness in financial markets added to the perception that oil supply remains higher than demand despite producer efforts to reduce output. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with non-OPEC producers like Russia, has pledged to restrict output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018.\n\n\"Sentiment in oil markets remains weak,\" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.\n\nOil is declining even amid signs that crude markets are tightening.\n\nThe Brent forward curve has moved from contango into backwardation, where prices for immediate delivery are higher than those later on, for the three months of futures. A so-called backwardated market is considered a bullish sign for prices since it indicates that demand is outpacing supply.\n\nSigns of supply tightness are also appearing in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer. Despite a 13 percent jump in production since mid-2016 to 9.5 million bpd, the country's commercial crude inventories have fallen 13 percent from their March records to below 2016 levels.\n\nOn the demand side, Asia in particular could see some stronger crude orders going into the second half of the year.\n\nDriven by the start-up of a refinery in Yunnan province in southern China and the completed expansion of a fuel processing facility at Huizhou, Chinese crude oil imports are expected to pick up.\n\n\"We expect Chinese crude imports to increase by 700,000 bpd y-o-y (year-on-year) on average in 2H 2017,\" energy consultancy FGE said.\n\nNew oil demand is also coming from Vietnam, which will see record crude oil imports in August as it readies its second refinery for start-up.\n\n\"As domestic crude production continues to fall, Vietnam's historical surplus in crude oil will come to an end by 2019, turning the country into a net importer,\" said Peter Lee, oil analyst at BMI Research.\n\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with non-OPEC producers like Russia, has pledged to restrict output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018.\n\n\"Sentiment in oil markets remains weak,\" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.\n\nOil is declining even amid signs that crude markets are tightening.\n\nThe Brent forward curve has moved from contango into backwardation, where prices for immediate delivery are higher than those later on, for the three months of futures. A so-called backwardated market is considered a bullish sign for prices since it indicates that demand is outpacing supply.\n\nSigns of supply tightness are also appearing in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer. Despite a 13 percent jump in production since mid-2016 to 9.5 million bpd, the country's commercial crude inventories have fallen 13 percent from their March records to below 2016 levels.\n\nOn the demand side, Asia in particular could see some stronger crude orders going into the second-half of the year.\n\nDriven by the start-up of a refinery in Yunnan province in southern China and the completed expansion of a fuel processing facility at Huizhou, Chinese crude oil imports are expected to pick up.\n\n\"We expect Chinese crude imports to increase by 700,000 bpd year-on-year on average in 2H 2017,\" said energy consultancy FGE.\n\nNew oil demand is also coming from Vietnam, which will see record crude oil imports in August as it readies its second refinery for start-up.\n\n\"As domestic crude production continues to fall, Vietnam's historical surplus in crude oil will come to an end by 2019, turning the country into a net importer,\" said Peter Lee, oil analyst at BMI Research.

Including emergency reserves, crude stocks were at 1.15 billion barrels, the lowest since October 2015.\n\nHowever, petrol inventories did not decline as expected, and the data also showed that US crude output rose to 9.5 million barrels per day from 9.4 million a week earlier.\n\nRising US output could add to global oversupply that prompted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers to curtail production to boost prices.\n\nTraders weighed the US stockpile draw against the production data.\n\nGene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy, noted that seasonally, US demand peaks during the summer. \"If we see these draws past Labor Day, it will drive the market, possibly past $50,\" he said.\n\nMatt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, noted that, \"The peak of summer driving season has now passed, and demand for crude should wane also as refinery runs drop.

Not a lot has changed despite the OPEC and Russia efforts recently. While these producers have tried to limit their oil output, U.S. shale oil continues to rise,\" said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries together with non-OPEC producers such as Russia have pledged to restrict output by 1.8 bpd between January this year and March 2018.\n\nOffsetting much of that effort, however, U.S. oil production has soared by almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.42 million bpd.\n\n\"OPEC and Russia still face an uphill battle in reducing the global supply surplus in the face of growth in output elsewhere and less than compliant behaviour in their midst (Iraq, UAE),\" said French bank BNP Paribas.\n\nOn the demand side, analysts see a gradual slowdown in fuel consumption growth.\n\nIn the United States, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said gasoline demand was already peaking due to improving fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles.\n\nIn China, state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) said gasoline demand would likely peak around 2025 and outright oil consumption would top out around 2030.\n\nThis means that oil demand from the world's two

Seven of its 10 main sectors were in the red.\n\nU.S. stocks opened lower on Thursday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting showed growing concerns over weak inflation, while investors worried about President Donald Trump's ability to pursue his pro-growth policies.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.31 points, or 0.23 perc ent, to 21,974.56. The S&P 500 lost 7.62 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 2,460.49. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 25.39 points, or 0.40 per cent, to 6,319.72.\n\nIndexes closed off their highs on Wednesday following mR. Trump's decision to disband two business councils after several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks on white nationalists.\n\n\"I think it creates concern. Now, you will have to question what the administration will be able to do going forward to implement any kind of policy,\" said Bob Phillips, managing principal at Spectrum Management Group.\n\nWeak inflation has spurred concerns that the Fed may have to cool its monetary tightening pace even though the economy is growing moderately and the unemployment rate is at a 16-year low.\n\nThe central bank is also considering reducing its $4.2- trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.\n\n\"The Fed beginning to reduce its balance sheet will cause some upward pressure on interest rates and the Fed won't probably see a need to raise rates once more this year. That's my gut feeling,\" Mr. Phillips said.\n\nOfficials have been priming markets for a probable move at their next policy meeting on Sept. 19 and 20. New York Fed President William Dudley said earlier the expectation of such an announcement next month was not unreasonable.\n\nInvestors will also be focusing on Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and his Minneapolis counterpart Neel Kashkari, who are speaking at different events later in the day.\n\nMr. Kaplan, a centrist voter on policy this year, will discuss how much inflation weakness he is willing to tolerate before putting additional rate-hike plans on hold.\n\nData showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near six-month low last week, pointing to a further tightening in the labor market.\n\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to 232,000, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dropping to 240,000.\n\nShares of Wal-Mart were down about 3.2 per cent in early trading after the retail giant reported a quarterly margin drop as it continued to cut prices and invest in its e-commerce operations.\n\nOil prices steadied on Thursday after U.S. data showed a big fall in crude stockpiles but also an increase in production, taking U.S. crude output to its highest in more than two years.\n\nBrent crude was down 10 cents at $50.17 a barrel. U.S. light crude was 15 cents lower at $46.63.\n\nBoth benchmarks fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday.\n\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA) data showed commercial U.S. crude stocks have fallen by almost 13 percent from their peaks in March to 466.5 million barrels. Stocks are now lower than in 2016.\n\nBut U.S. oil output is rising fast as shale producers take advantage of a recent increase in prices.\n\nU.S. production jumped by 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.75 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016.\n\n\"The EIA data suggest the U.S. oil market is becoming more balanced, with crude inventories falling,\" said Tamas Varga, senior market analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.\n\n\"But the big jump in production was the focus.\"\n\nRising U.S. output has been undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers including Russia to drain a global fuel glut.\n\nThey have promised to restrict output by a total of 1.8 million bpd between January this year and March 2018.\n\nWilliam O'Loughlin at Rivkin Securities said that if inventory declines continued at the current pace, U.S. stocks would fall below the five-year average in two months.\n\n\"The pace of the declines indicates that OPEC production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is skeptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,\" he added.\n\nBrent prices are down almost 12 per cent since OPEC and its allies began cutting production in January.\n\nOil producers have enjoyed years of rocketing demand, fueled largely by China's voracious thirst coming from over 2 million new car sales a month.\n\nBut this boom is coming to an end as its vehicle sales slow in a maturing market, and as cars become more efficient and start using alternative fuels.\n\n\"Gasoline consumption growth in China is set to see a marked slowdown over the coming years, due to macroeconomic headwinds, improving fuel economy and competition from alternative fuels,\" BMI Research said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id":

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at US$46.78 a barrel, down 77 cents, or 1.6 per cent.\n\nUS crude inventories dropped for a seventh consecutive week, falling 8.95 million barrels last week to 466.5 million barrels to their lowest since January 2016, the Energy Information Administration said. Including emergency reserves, crude stocks were at 1.15 billion barrels, the lowest since October 2015.\n\nHowever, gasoline inventories did not decline as expected, and the data also showed that US crude output rose to 9.5 million barrels per day from 9.4 million a week earlier.\n\nRising US output could add to global oversupply that prompted the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers to curtail production to boost prices.\n\nTraders weighed the US stockpile draw against the production data.\n\nGene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy, noted that seasonally, US demand peaks during the summer. \"If we see these draws past Labour Day, it will drive the market, possibly past US$50.\n\nMatt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, noted that \"The peak of summer driving season has now passed, and demand for crude should wane also as refinery runs drop. Gasoline demand will ebb as summer road trips are mostly over and children head back to school.\"\n\nUS gasoline stocks were unchanged, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.1 million-barrel drop.\n\nOpec and other major producers including Russia have pledged to restrict output. Still, US oil production has soared almost 12 per cent since mid-2016.\n\n\"Opec and Russia still face an uphill battle in reducing the global supply surplus in the face of growth in output elsewhere and less than compliant behaviour in their midst (Iraq, UAE),\" French bank BNP Paribas said.\n\nOpec member Angola released a loading plan showing October exports were planned at a 13-month high.\n\nOn the demand side, analysts see a gradual slowdown in fuel consumption growth.\n\nEnergy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said US gasoline demand was peaking due to improving fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles. In China, state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) said gasoline demand would likely peak around 2025 and oil consumption would top out around 2030.\n\nThis means oil demand from the world's two biggest consumers may soon stall. Consumption has already peaked in Europe and Japan. -- Reuters", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 37, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy"}, {"uri":

The price for Brent, the global benchmark for the price of oil, is down about 4.5 percent from where it started August.\n\nBalance has been the word of the year, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries working to eat away at a surplus in the five-year average for global crude oil inventories with managed production declines.\n\nData this week from the U.S. Energy Information Administration supported a bullish report on declines in U.S. crude oil inventories offered by the American Petroleum Institute. Commercial crude oil inventories are about 26 million barrels below this time last year, but are 214 million barrels greater than the same week in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. crude oil production predictions continue to show gains despite weak market conditions. OPEC, for its part, is fighting something of an uphill battle because Libya, which is exempt from the deal because of national security concerns, continues to pump more oil.\n\n\"Despite positive indications that the oil complex is working toward balance, market concerns remain regarding U.S. and OPEC supply and the fact that the high demand season soon will be coming to a close,\" Jenna Delaney, a senior oil analyst at PIRA Energy, said in an emailed report. \"From a fundamental standpoint, prices are likely to remain range bound in the near term.\"\n\nBrent was trading 0.5 percent lower than the previous close to sell for $50.02 per barrel at 9:20 a.m. EDT. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, continued its drift away from Brent parity by losing 0.56 percent to fall to $46.52 per barrel.\n\nLower WTI prices make it competitive in some global markets. For the week ending Aug. 11, U.S. crude oil exports were about 20 percent higher than the four-week average for this time last year, but represented only a fraction of the average 9.5 million barrels per day produced for the same week.\n\nThe U.S. government said this week it planned to sell barrels from its strategic reserves, though the volume is not likely to have a major market impact.\n\nOn the economic front, the U.S. Labor Department reported first-time claims for unemployment declined last week by 12,000, though the four-week average showed a decline of just 400 from the previous week.\n\nOverseas, data from the European Union show inflation for the countries that use the euro currency at 1.3 percent in July, stable since June but above the 0.2 percent gain from July 2016.

Traders keep a close watch on inventory levels to get an indication of market tightening as the glut of oil on the global market acts as a governor on the price of oil.\n\nOil prices dropped below $30 per barrel last year under the dual strains of robust U.S. crude oil production and a strategy from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to defend their market share with more oil. OPEC in January enacted a measure that aims to ease the supply strains with managed production declines.\n\nOle Hanson, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in an emailed newsletter crude oil prices have lost ground since June and the possibility that crude oil prices move much higher than $50 per barrel is unlikely because OPEC is struggling to clear the oversupply.\n\nThe price for Brent crude oil was up 0.26 percent from the previous close to $50.95 per barrel at 9:15 a.m. EDT. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for the price of oil, was up 0.25 percent to $47.67 per barrel.\n\nMarkets will be influenced late Wednesday morning when the U.S. Energy Information Administration releases official figures on crude oil and gasoline inventories. Traders may already be looking further ahead, however, as the late September end to the official U.S. summer travel season ends.\n\n\"A potential second counter-seasonal increase in gasoline stocks could have a dampening impact on what is expected to be the seventh consecutive weekly drop in oil stocks,\" Hanson said.\n\nAPI figures tend to be considerably more bullish than official EIA figures. A survey of analyst sentiments compiled early this week by S&P Global Platts revealed expectations of a 3.6 million drop in U.S. crude oil inventories and a 400,000 barrel decline for gasoline. For crude oil inventories, that leaves the surplus at 23 percent above the five-year average, down from the 34 percent reported at the end of March.\n\nFor the broader markets, the U.S. Commerce Department reported new home construction dropped 4.8 percent from June and 5.6 percent lower than the same time last year.\n\nIn the European Union, meanwhile, data for the 19 countries that use the euro currency show gross domestic product increased 0.6 percent during the second quarter for 2.2 percent growth.

The firm based its assessment on a break-even price for Permian operations at around $41 per barrel.\n\nHari said a report this week from the U.S. Energy Information Administration of a large drop in crude oil inventories was offset by an increase in U.S. crude oil production, which she said leaves oil prices locked in a relatively narrow trading range.\n\n\"What should be worrying about this seeming impasse for OPEC is that there is also a clear downside bias to crude, as a continued decline in U.S. crude stocks at the feverish pace seen since April this year looks unlikely beyond the summer peak demand season, while expectations of a persistent global supply glut have taken a firm hold,\" she said.\n\nThe price for Brent crude oil was up 0.2 percent at 9:15 a.m. EDT to $51.13 per barrel. WTI narrowed the spread on Brent somewhat, gaining 0.36 percent to $47.26 per barrel.\n\nOle Hanson, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in an emailed newsletter earlier this week that crude oil prices have lost ground since June and the possibility that crude oil prices move much higher than $50 per barrel is unlikely because OPEC is struggling to clear the oversupply. The International Energy Agency reported the market was moving toward balance, but said that even if stockpiles for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development dropped 500,000 barrels per day until the end of first quarter 2018, they would still be about 60 million barrels above the five-year average.\n\nMarkets will likely move strongly one way or the other after drilling services company Baker Hughes releases weekly data on exploration and production. Reported as rig counts, gains in the United States would likely push oil prices lower as drilling figures offer a loose indication of momentum in a particular sector.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "wgt": 100, "id": 38, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "wgt": 100, "id": 40, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100, "id": 45, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 649, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty", "wgt": 100, "id": 859, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199444"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302590", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303081", "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "303189", "label": {"eng": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303565", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Time Zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304191", "label": {"eng": "Price of petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304192", "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304297", "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304665", "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305421", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "308346", "label": {"eng": "OPEC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309704", "label": {"eng": "Energy Information Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310654", "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315784", "label": {"eng": "Shale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316555", "label": {"eng": "Stocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "326693", "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "336043", "label": {"eng": "Peak oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxo_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "344148", "label": {"eng": "Saxo Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349993", "label": {"eng": "Permian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "397928", "label": {"eng": "Shale oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Hanson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "604395", "label": {"eng": "Ole Hanson"}}]}

Including emergency reserves, crude stocks were at 1.15 billion barrels, the lowest since October 2015. [EIA/S]\n\nHowever, gasoline inventories did not decline as expected, and the data also showed that U.S. crude output rose to 9.5 million barrels per day from 9.4 million a week earlier.\n\nRising U.S. output could add to global oversupply that prompted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers to curtail production to boost prices.\n\nTraders weighed the U.S. stockpile draw against the production data.\n\nGene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy, noted that seasonally, U.S. demand peaks during the summer. \"If we see these draws past Labor Day, it will drive the market, possibly past $50.\n\nMatt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, noted that \"The peak of summer driving season has now passed, and demand for crude should wane also as refinery runs drop. Gasoline demand will ebb as summer road trips are mostly over and children head back to school.\"\n\nU.S. gasoline stocks\n\n\"OPEC and Russia still face an uphill battle in reducing the global supply surplus in the face of growth in output elsewhere and less than compliant behaviour in their midst (Iraq, UAE),\" French bank BNP Paribas said.\n\nOPEC member Angola released a loading plan showing October exports were planned at a 13-month high.\n\nOn the demand side, analysts see a gradual slowdown in fuel consumption growth.\n\nEnergy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said U.S. gasoline demand was peaking due to improving fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles. In China, state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) said gasoline demand would likely peak around 2025 and oil consumption would top out around 2030.\n\nThis means oil demand from the world's two biggest consumers may soon stall. Consumption has already peaked in Europe and Japan.\n\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio)\n\n(This story has not been edited by

A backwardated market is considered a bullish sign for prices since it indicates demand is outpacing supply.\n\nSigns of supply tightness have started appearing in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nDespite a 13 percent jump in production since mid-2016 to 9.5 million bpd, the country's commercial crude inventories have fallen 13 percent from their March records to below 2016 levels.\n\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Edmund Blair and David Evans)\n\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "wgt": 100, "id": 38, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "wgt": 100, "id": 40, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100, "id": 45, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 649, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty", "wgt": 100, "id": 859, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "99729"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199444"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302791", "label": {"eng": "Greenwich Mean Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303101", "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303385", "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304191", "label": {"eng": "Price of petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304192", "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304665", "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305421", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306933", "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307116", "label": {"eng": "Royal Dutch Shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307862", "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309549", "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310387", "label": {"eng": "Consumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310391", "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310654", "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contango", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "352060", "label": {"eng": "Contango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_backwardation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "457497", "label": {"eng": "Normal backwardation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1287164", "label": {"eng": "Forward curve"}}]}

US production had the biggest weekly advance since June, according to Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday, offsetting the largest decline in stockpiles since September. Oil processing in China fell by the most in three years in July, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday.\n\nOil this month has fluctuated in the tightest range since February as production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies drain a surplus slower than expected. Brent crude prices will struggle to climb above US$60 (RM247) a barrel during the next five years because of plentiful supplies from both Opec and US shale, according to Citigroup Inc.\n\n\"Inventories are dropping pretty nicely, but as far as the future is concerned, the balancing job gets harder with output increasing more than people think,\" said Ric Spooner, an analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. \"We might just see the market begin to pause between here and mid-US$44 and US$47.\"\n\nWest Texas Intermediate for September delivery was at US$47.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 1 cent, at 7.59am in London. Total volume traded was about 29 per cent below the 100-day average. Prices rose 31 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to US$47.09 yesterday, the first gain in four sessions.\n\nBrent for October settlement fell 2 cents to US$51.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract yesterday advanced 76 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to US$51.03 a barrel. Prices are down 2.1 per cent this week. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of US$3.81 to WTI.\n\nUS crude output rose by 79,000 barrels a day to 9.5 million a day last week, the highest since July 2015, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. Stockpiles declined for a seventh week to 466.5 million barrels.\n\nOil-market news:\n\nUS gasoline demand in July increased by 1 per cent from a year earlier to a record 9.69 million barrels a day,

Experts believed that stocks decreased only by 0.64percent.\n\nOPEC and other oil producers, such as Azerbaijan, Kingdom of Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Sultanate of Oman, the Russian Federation, Republic of Sudan, and the Republic of South Sudan made a deal in December 2016 to remove 1.8 million barrels a day from the market.\n\nOPEC+, trying to reduce a crude glut, decided in May to extend the supply cut through March 2018.\n\n---\n\nFollow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "wgt": 100,

Sources added the unit would remain out of service for at least a week to carry out repairs.\n\nThe Brent forward curve has moved from contango into backwardation, where prices for immediate delivery are higher than those for the three future months. A backwardated market is considered a bullish sign for prices since it indicates demand is outpacing supply.\n\nSigns of supply tightness have started appearing in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nDespite a 13 percent jump in production since mid-2016 to 9.5 million bpd, the country's commercial crude inventories have fallen 13 percent from their March records to below 2016 levels.\n\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Edmund Blair and David Evans)\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "wgt": 100, "id": 38, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "wgt": 100, "id": 40, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100, "id": 45, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Alternative"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 649, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Beauty", "wgt": 100, "id": 859, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Beauty"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199444"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302791", "label": {"eng": "Greenwich Mean Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303101", "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303385", "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304191", "label": {"eng": "Price of petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304192", "label": {"eng": "Barrel (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Crude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304665", "label": {"eng": "Brent Crude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305421", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307116", "label": {"eng": "Royal Dutch Shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307862", "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309453", "label": {"eng": "Refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309549", "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310387", "label": {"eng": "Consumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310391", "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310654", "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contango", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "352060", "label": {"eng": "Contango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_backwardation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "457497", "label": {"eng": "Normal backwardation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1287164", "label": {"eng": "Forward curve"}}]}

Despite steadily declining inventories since March, crude oil prices are actually lower today. Let's examine recent crude oil supply/demand history to see if we can determine what's behind this divergence.\n\nSince fracking technologies unlocked more domestic oil supplies, the United States has steadily increased its production.\n\nAs production increased from 2010 to 2015, stockpiles began to build and prices eventually responded. Between 2014 and today, crude oil prices have been cut in half.\n\nIn response to the collapse in prices, OPEC cut production and many domestic producers did the same. According to Baker Hughes, the number of active U.S. rigs went from around 1600 in 2014 to just 400 in May of last year. This decline in domestic production was temporary, however, as domestic producer rig counts are now back to over 900 and daily production is nearing 2015's record levels.\n\nDespite the recent uptick in production, domestic crude oil inventories have steadily declined from record levels this March, and are now back within their five year average.\n\nCrude prices, meanwhile have been seemingly disconnected from the inventory drawdown and are now about 10% below where they were during March's peak inventories.\n\nSo, to recap: domestic inventories are depleting despite domestic production near record levels. This is indicative of an increase in demand. Despite an apparent increase in demand and declining inventories, oil prices are steady to lower over the last six months. Additionally, remember that oil prices are 50% below where they were in 2014, when we were producing just as much crude as we are today. The question is: given comparable levels of production was crude oil too rich in 2014 or too cheap today? It appears to me that consumers are absorbing the increase in production, and I would be surprised if crude oil moves significantly lower from here. The OPEC wild card remains, however, and should they abandon their production cuts then prices could press this year's lows.\n\nThere are several strategies available utilizing both futures and options to capitalize on the idea that crude oil may be nearing a bottom over the next 12-18 months. Please contact me to discuss what may be suitable for you. As always, remember that futures and options trading is not suitable for all investors.

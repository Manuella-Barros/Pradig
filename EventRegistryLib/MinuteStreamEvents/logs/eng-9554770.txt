The government wanted to create an environment to help businesses to flourish and be a pragmatic part of solutions, he said.\n\nThe question of how many tourists should be coming to the country was not one he believed he should answer, saying the regions should be working out how many visitors they wanted.\n\nTourism Industry Aotearoa (TIA) chief executive Rebecca Ingram said the industry had momentum and was looking for new opportunities.\n\nA recent survey showed operators were feeling optimistic especially after a strong summer, with about 80 percent feeling positive about the next 12 months.\n\n\"Like many businesses, tourism business owners are conscious of increasing costs and product pricing, quickly followed by workforce retention. Weather-related challenges, climate change related impacts and managing staff wellbeing are also top of mind,\" she said.\n\nWhile staffing had improved, about 50 percent of business told the TIA they were recruiting - which was still quite high, she said.\n\n\"We are also seeing positive changes in the seasonal nature of our workforce, with 74 percent of respondents planning to hold their staff levels over the winter as they did last year to retain skills and ensure they were ready for next summer.\"\n\nAddressing that seasonality was one of Tourism New Zealand's focuses.\n\nChief executive Ren\u00e9 de Monchy told TRENZ that many operators faced significant a drop off in visitors and income with reduced staff outside peak season.\n\n\"The challenge is that over-reliance on those three months over summer, 37 percent, 40 percent of the value so imagine a tourism sector with a more stable year round demand,\" he said.\n\n\"A world where tourism operators have the greater ability to invest into their product, invest in their sustainability, invest in their workforce and people, and invest in their community.\"\n\nIt was much more sustainable for tourism operators and regions to have visitors spread out throughout the year rather than relying on a summer surge, he said.\n\n\"Utilising our consumer data and our insights, developing some new travel insights amongst our target audiences to motivate them to come here.\"\n\nThat would include busting some myths about what tourists could do if they travelled to Aotearoa outside of the peak season, he said.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Doocey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Doocey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_conservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature conservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--ei5ASrVP--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1662341025/4LMHR74_Tourists_at_the_Red_Shed_in_Glenorchy_jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554770", "eventUri": "eng-9554770", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

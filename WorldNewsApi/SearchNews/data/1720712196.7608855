{"id": 231961402, "title": "Michael Mosley, the inspiring, experimental TV doctor who changed the way we eat", "text": "In 2013, Dr Michael Mosley changed the way a nation ate. That was the year the broadcaster, who died this week at the age of 67 after going missing on holiday in Greece, released his groundbreaking first book, The Fast Diet. It advocated the \u201c5:2\u201d method of drastically restricting your calorie consumption on two days out of every seven, and was an immediate sensation upon its release. Everyone from celebrity chefs to politicians to the colleague you bumped into in the kitchen seemed to be singing its praises. As a bemused New York Times report put it, Britain had \u201cdevelop[ed] a voracious appetite for a new diet\u201d. But popularising the 5:2 \u2013 and the overall concept of intermittent fasting \u2013 was just one facet of Mosley\u2019s unique broadcasting career, which saw him test out often strange-seeming techniques or take on unusual challenges in the name of learning more about how our bodies work, and how we might lead a healthier life. His self-experimentation, he once admitted to The Guardian, was inspired by his father\u2019s death as a result of complications from diabetes. \u201cNo male in my family has made it beyond 72,\u201d he said. \u201cHis friends said how much like him I was, so he was kind of a warning from history.\u201d Mosley\u2019s career path was an unconventional one. After studying politics, philosophy and economics at the University of Oxford, he spent two years in the city as an investment banker, but found the work unsatisfying. \u201cI decided then that my primary interest in life wasn\u2019t making money for myself or other people,\u201d he later told the British Medical Journal. \u201cI was passionately interested in what makes people tick\u2026 and I actually went into medicine intending to become a psychiatrist.\u201d He started medical school soon afterwards, and met his wife Dr Clare Bailey on his first day. But his psychiatry placements felt underwhelming too. \u201cI went into it with huge hopes and beliefs, and then it became more obvious that there were severe limitations to what you could do,\u201d he said. When he had qualified as a doctor, he saw a newspaper advert for the BBC\u2019s trainee assistant producer scheme, and decided to apply on a whim. He was offered the job, and then had to choose between making another career change or continuing as a junior doctor. \u201cI went on holiday to Greece, and I had two telegrams that I wrote in my hand,\u201d he told the BMJ. He initially sent a message declining the BBC gig, but \u201cfelt a tremendous sense of loss. Then I sent another telegram saying, \u2018I\u2019ve changed my mind\u2019\u201d. It was clearly the right decision. Mosley became a producer on science programmes including Tomorrow\u2019s World, Horizon and QED, and received an Emmy nomination for his work on John Cleese\u2019s documentary The Human Face, in which the comedian explored the science behind facial expression, recognition and beauty. He then started making appearances in front of the camera, too, first in the 2008 series Medical Mavericks, a show about self-experimenting doctors and scientists that he had \u201cpitched\u2026 to every controller of every channel for 14 years\u201d. His own willingness to self-experiment on camera \u2013 and try out things that most presenters would surely shy away from \u2013 would come to characterise his broadcasting work. In his BBC documentary The Wonderful World of Blood, he added his own blood to a black pudding recipe and injected snake venom into his bloodstream to look at its clotting effects. For Infested: Living With Parasites, he even infected himself with a tapeworm to study its impact on his body (he ended up suffering no major ill effects, but did put on a kilogram in weight). His abundant zeal for science leapt out in these zany on-screen investigations, with his findings delivered in a way that felt accessible without patronising the audience. Somehow, he remained unphased by, say, tracking down and then ingesting tapeworm eggs in Kenya. With characteristic understatement, he later described the experience as \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d (braving underground caves in a programme about fear, though, did leave him \u201creally freaked\u201d). In more recent years, his experiments were tamer \u2013 for example trying out Nordic walking or Tai Chi for his BBC wellbeing podcast Just One Thing \u2013 but still retained that infectious sense of curiosity and his easy-going interviewing style. It was the release of his 2012 Horizon documentary Eat, Fast and Live Longer that really caught the public\u2019s attention, though. Mosley had been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, but wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of immediately taking medication. \u201cMy father had developed it at the same age,\u201d he later told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Saturday Live. \u201cAnd he\u2019d died 20 years later of complications of diabetes\u2026 I sort of knew where this journey ended or was likely to end.\u201d So he persuaded the BBC to let him make a programme in which he would essentially try to reverse his condition. Mosley ended up exploring research from the scientists Mark Mattson and Michelle Harvie, who had investigated how cutting food intake significantly might impact weight loss and longevity. After looking into the potential benefits of restricting calories for two days each week, Mosley tested out a 5:2 diet, in which he would eat normally five days each week, then consume only 800 calories on two \u201cfast\u201d days. His results were striking: he managed to lose around 9 kilos and appeared to have reversed his Type 2 diabetes. His book The Fast Diet, co-written with the journalist Mimi Spencer, ended up selling 350,000 copies in the UK in the year it was published; it has since sold more than 1 million copies and has been translated into 30 languages. Mosley also became a regular contributor on shows like This Morning and The One Show, sharing his insights on health and wellbeing stories. Speaking shortly after his disappearance, This Morning guest host Vanessa Feltz seemed to encapsulate his appeal as a presenter. \u201cHe is a man of irrepressible energy and enthusiasm,\u201d she said. \u201cHis enthusiasm is for everyone else to feel the same \u2013 to be your fittest and enjoy life to your fullest.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The broadcaster had a unique and varied career, spanning a stint in the city, diet books and self-experiments on screen, writes Katie Rosseinsky  </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/michael-mosley-tv-doctor-death-b2558717.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/07/15/newFile-17.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:53:48", "author": "Katie Rosseinsky", "authors": ["Katie Rosseinsky"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.125}

The thrilling match took place at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, leading KKR to their fourth IPL final.\n\nFollowing KKR's victory, Shah Rukh Khan, accompanied by his children Suhana and AbRam, took a victory lap around the stadium to celebrate with fans. Alongside them were close friends Ananya Panday, Agastya Nanda, Navya Naveli Nanda, and Shanaya Kapoor.\n\nDuring this celebratory lap, the actor inadvertently walked into a live broadcast being conducted by former cricketers Aakash Chopra, Parthiv Patel, and Suresh Raina.\n\nIn the viral video, Shah Rukh Khan is seen realising his mistake and immediately apologizing to the commentators. He greeted them with folded hands and warm hugs, showcasing his down-to-earth demeanor. Aakash Chopra praised Shah Rukh, saying, \"Oh, what a man! Legend!

Former cricketers Aakash Chopra, Parthiv Patel and Suresh Raina were conducting the show when Shahrukh arrived on the scene.\n\nWhile Suhana spotted the live shoot and moved his brother to the side, Shah Rukh walked right in, before apologising with folded hands for interrupting the proceedings.\n\nAs the Bollywood star apologised, he made sure to hug all three of them and later apologised to the fans watching the broadcast before continuing the lap around the stadium.\n\n\"Oh, what a man! Legend!\" said Chopra after the happy accident. \"He did not even realise that he walked into the show. He was very apologetic, but I said, 'You made our day. You are the showstopper.\"\n\n\"I spent a bit of time at KKR with him. I batted at No. 8 and also at No. 6 then. He was very supportive,\" he added.\n\nThe former India opener also took to X to call Khan a legend.\n\nChasing a modest target of 160 in the qualifier, KKR hardly broke a sweat and won the match inside 14 overs as Venkatesh Iyers scored an unbeaten 28-ball 51 while skipper Shreyas Iyer hit 58 not out off 24 balls.\n\nHowever, the match was beautifully set up by the bowlers, especially Mitchell Starc who justified why the KKR board had splurged a record-breaking sum on him during the previous auction.\n\nStarc sent destructive opener Travis Head back to the pavilion on the second ball of the match for a duck. SRH's innings took a downturn from there as Head's opening partner Abhishek Sharma was sent back in the next over as well.\n\nSRH lost four wickets inside the powerplay and never really recovered from there despite useful contributions from Heinrich Klassen and skipper Pat Cummins down the order.\n\nSRH, however, still have a chance to make it to the final in the second qualifier where they face the winner of the eliminator game between the Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Rajasthan Royals.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Bowling first, KKR bowled out high-flying SRH for a modest total of 159 runs. At one stage, SRH were reeling at 126 for 9 before Pat Cummins' 30-run knock helped them post a 150-plus total. Mitchell Starc starred with the ball, taking three big wickets in the powerplay while in-form spinner Varun Chakravarthy claimed two.\n\nIn reply, KKR chased down the total in less than 14 overs and lost just two wickets. Captain Shreyas Iyer and Venkatesh Iyer scored unbeaten fifties to take their team home in style. KKR will now face the winner of the second qualifier in the final. SRH will face either Rajasthan Royals or Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the final.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varun_Chakravarthy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Varun Chakravarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venkatesh_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venkatesh Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toss (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Starc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Starc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/Shahrukhkhan.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588422", "eventUri": "eng-9588422", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 296}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 1159, "textEnd": 1165}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Finishing at the top of the points table during the league stage, KKR showcased their dominance by securing an eight-wicket victory over SRH.\n\nThis convincing win was largely facilitated by the outstanding performance of Mitchell Starc, who played a crucial role in restricting SRH to a modest total of 159 runs. Starc's exceptional bowling spell of 4-0-34-3 set the stage for KKR's triumph. During the chase, the two-time champions reached the target in just 13.4 overs. Skipper Shreyas Iyer's unbeaten knock of 58 runs off 24 balls and Venkatesh Iyer's stellar 51* off 28 deliveries ensured victory for the team.\n\nFollowing KKR's victory, legendary actor and team owner Shah Rukh Khan, accompanied by his daughter Suhana Khan and younger son Abram, embarked on a lap around the ground and thanked the fans for their support. During this celebratory moment, Shah Rukh paused in front of a section of the crowd and recreated his signature pose from his popular movie DDLJ. Subsequently, the 58-year-old actor proceeded to interact with the players, exchanging greetings and embracing them in moments of camaraderie.\n\nWhile the match at Narendra Modi Stadium brought abundant joy for SRK, it also brought despair for SRH's CEO, Kavya Maran. Kavya was observed seated in the stands with a sombre demeanour; her saddened expression vividly conveyed her disappointment with the team's performance.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\n\nBy Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen\n\nMALMO, Sweden (Reuters) -The second semi-final of this year's Eurovision Song Contest will take place in Sweden on Thursday, with Israel's performance expected to draw attention due to large pro-Palestinian protests planned in host city Malmo.\n\nSome 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city for the annual kitsch-fest, which is taking place amid protests and boycotts over the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security and are bracing for possible unrest during Eurovision week. Police officers have been seen patrolling the streets of Malmo and, from water scooters, the city's canals.\n\n\"There are sometimes more police than people in sequins, but overall great fun, we're having a great time,\" United Kingdom supporter Francesca Gaffey said ahead of the first semi-final on Tuesday.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, with police guarding the venue and checking visitors' bags.\n\nVisitors have to pass through metal detectors before entering the arena, and are only allowed to bring small purses into the venue.\n\nThursday's semi-final will feature two of the favourites to win, Switzerland's Nemo with the song \"The Code\" and Joost Klein of the Netherlands with the song \"Europapa\", as well as outsider Eden Golan of Israel with her song \"Hurricane\".\n\nThere is high security around the delegations from all the countries, according to Malmo police. \"We're keeping a bit of an extra eye on Israel of course, because of the situation,\" Lotta Svensson, a police incident commander, told Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nTens of thousands are expected at a pro-Palestinian demonstration in central Malmo at 1300 GMT on Thursday. A smaller nearby pro-Israel demonstration is scheduled for 1600 GMT.\n\nGaza-born Swedish student and Palestinian activist Bachar Garar, 23, will protest what he calls double standards, pointing to EBU's decision to ban Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"After everything that happened, how they've treated Russia after what happened in Ukraine, they just choose to turn a blind eye to what's happening in Gaza. So that's hypocrisy for us and we're trying to put an end to it,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli contestant Golan, 20, says she hopes her performance will help unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 1900 GMT and will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.\n\n(Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Louise Breusch Rasmussen in Copenhagen, Editing by Angus MacSwan and Jan Harvey)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The city has done an amazing job, there's a lot of demonstrations happening and people have got the right to do that and but it's just about the music.\" Clark's co-host Mills added: \"It does feel a little different but it's about the music and the joy that we have every single year at Eurovision.\"\n\nAhead of the events at Malmo Arena in Sweden this week, those attending were warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags and were told that there will be \"vigorous security checks\". Palestine is not competing in this year's competition but Israel - located in the Middle East - is.\n\nEurovision organisers were slammed earlier this week for a statement made regarding a supposed \"non-political nature\" tribute during the semi-final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was accused of being \"morally corrupt\" and \"hypocritical\" after the board expressed \"regret\" over Eric Saade's performance on Tuesday night.\n\nFormer Swedish Eurovision contestant Saade took to the stage in Sweden to open the competition's semi-final and performed his 2011 entry Popular. Saade wore a keffiyeh print scarf wrapped around his left wrist. The keffiyeh is associated with Palestinian people and often worn as an act of solidarity by those who support the country amid Israel's war on Gaza and its surrounding areas but is not an official political motif or symbol.\n\nAfter Saade's Eurovision performance and his fashion choice sparked controversy, a spokesperson for the EBU expressed disappointment: \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show. All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest, and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nA piece of fabric angered the EBU on Tuesday\n\nIsrael's entry Golan, 20, will take part in the semi-final in Malmo, Sweden on Thursday with her track Hurricane, which was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel. Musically, Hurricane is the same song as October Rain - but the lyrics are now more general.\n\nSince Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October and took hostages, more than 35,000 Palestinians have been injured, meaning that over 100,000 people have now been killed or injured in the six months of Israel's offensive. It's estimated that at least a further 7000 lie dead beneath the rubble.\n\nEven though Israel isn't in Europe, it's been allowed to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest over recent years due to its membership in the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The Middle Eastern nation first joined the Eurovision fray in 1973 and has since bagged the top prize twice.\n\nThousands of people are expected at a pro-Palestinian march on Thursday, which the Swedish Police Authority said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\". There have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nBritish Eurovision hopeful Olly Alexander, who previously signed a letter slamming Israel as an \"apartheid regime\" before his December reveal as the UK's contestant, has faced a barrage of criticism from fans and campaigners for not heeding the Palestinian call for a BDS movement boycott and pulling out of this year's contest.\n\nBack in October, Alexander expressed support for Palestinians and urged a halt to hostilities between Israel and Hamas, the governing authority in Gaza. A letter from LGBT+ group Voices4London, which Alexander endorsed, condemned Israel's policies towards Palestine, accusing it of attempting \"ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nMany have called on Alexander, Clark and Mills to boycott this year's Eurovision Song Contest\n\nIn the BBC documentary, Olly Alexander's Road To Eurovision '24, an emotional Alexander responded to the intense criticism and justified his decision to ignore the boycott demands. \"A lot of the contestants and myself have been having a lot of comments that are like 'You are complicit in a genocide by taking part in Eurovision' which is quite extreme. It's very extreme,\" said the star of It's A Sin, fighting back tears. I understand where that sentiment is coming from but I think it's not correct.\"\n\nAlexander said: \"It's an incredibly complicated political situation, one that I'm not qualified to speak on. The backdrop to this is actual immense suffering. It's a humanitarian crisis, a war. It just so happens there's a song contest going on at the same time that I'm a part of.\"\n\nQueers For Palestine responded, telling Alexander to \"consider his place in history\" and that it's \"not too late to do the right thing. Their statement read: \"We share @ollyalexanderr 's upset. The European Broadcasting Union has failed him and other contestants by refusing to ban genocidal Israel.\n\n\"But by insisting that he knows better than Palestinians Olly Alexander again flaunts a colonial mentality. We reiterate our call on Olly Alexander to boycott Eurovision. Doing no harm to the Palestinian freedom struggle by refusing to be complicit in artwashing genocide is a profound ethical duty. Olly, it's not too late to do the right thing. This moment could define the rest of your life. Consider your place in history.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits.\n\n\"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\"\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Norway and the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"},

Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits.\n\n\"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\"\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Norway and the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [],

'It's all about the music'", "body": "Eurovision host Rylan Clark has defended the Eurovision Song Contest ahead of further protests over Israel's participation.\n\nIsrael 2024 entry Eden Golan is set to take to the stage on Thursday for there second semi-final, where she will perform the song Hurricane.\n\nThe EBU has declined requests to ban the country from participating despite the conflict in the Gaza, where the estimated Palestinian death toll has reportedly reached 34,000.\n\nClark addressed the ongoing controversy and said people have \"the right\" to take part in protests over Israel's participation but the song contest is \"just about the music\".\n\nClark, who is hosting the BBC's coverage of the competition alongside Graham Norton and Scott Mills, told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"Malmo is doing an amazing job of hosting Eurovision.\n\n\"The climate in the world at the minute isn't great and you know we're not silly to not understand that there's a lot going on in the world, but I think in the Eurovision bubble it's a song contest, it's all about the music and that's what we're here for.\n\n\"The city has done an amazing job, there's a lot of demonstrations happening and people have got the right to do that and but it's just about the music.\"\n\nMills added: \"It does feel a little different but it's about the music and the joy that we have every single year at Eurovision.\"\n\nGolan, 20, will take part in the semi-final in Malmo, Sweden on Thursday with her emotional track Hurricane, which was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThousands of people are expected at a pro-Palestinian march on Thursday, which the Swedish Police Authority said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nMeanwhile, Golan told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nEurovision contestants and attendees have been cautioned that the EBU retains the authority to confiscate any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestine symbols during the event.", "source": {"uri":

Police estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 people took part. Among those in the crowd was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nChanting \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!\" and \"Israel is a terror state,\" the demonstrators set off smoke flares in the Palestinian colors during a noisy, peaceful rally to criticize Israel and call for a cease-fire. There was a large police presence, with a hovering helicopter, and officers on rooftops with binoculars.\n\n\"It's important to be here,\" said Amani Eli-Ali, a Malmo resident of Palestinian heritage. \"It's not OK for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nProtester Saadallah Aoudi, a Swedish citizen with Palestinian roots, said \"this is the wrong time\" for Israel to take part in the competition.\n\n\"It's about songs, and songs are about love. ... They should be here when there is peace,\" he said.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians, has brought a jarring juxtaposition to Eurovision week in Malmo. Music fans in colorful sequined outfits or draped in their national flags mixed in the streets with supporters of the Palestinian cause in keffiyeh scarves.\n\nPalestinian flags fly from windows and balconies along a pedestrianized thoroughfare that has been temporarily renamed \"Eurovision street.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel protest was also held Thursday in a central Malmo square.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups plan to march again on Saturday, the day of the Eurovision final.\n\nIsrael's government warned its citizens of a \"tangible concern\" Israelis could be targeted for attack in Malmo during the contest.\n\nContest organizers, who try to keep Eurovision a non-political event, have rejected calls to bar Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas.\n\nBut they told Israel to change the lyrics of its entry, originally titled \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and triggered the war. The song was renamed \"Hurricane\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nShe will compete in Thursday's semi-final. Some audience members attending a dress rehearsal on Wednesday could be heard to boo during Golan's performance.\n\nCritics of the decision to let Israel compete point out that Russia was kicked out of Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus was ejected a year earlier over its government's crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"We're supposed to be united by music but we're not united, because Israel is participating,\" said Malmo resident Anders Trolle-Schultz, who attended the protest.\n\n\"I think Malmo should have kept Eurovision, but we should have told Israel either 'Stay away,' or maybe even say, why don't we invite a Palestinian music group to participate? That would be fair.\"\n\nHistorian Dean Vuletic, author of \"Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest,\" said Eurovision has long been a focus of political controversies. Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus led to a Greek boycott the following year. Georgia pulled out of Eurovision in 2009, a year after it fought a brief war with Russia, after organizers rejected its proposed song, \"We Don't Wanna Put In\" -- an obvious reference to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Whenever countries compete with each other, things are going to get political,\" and Eurovision has always reflected the \"political zeitgeist\" in Europe, he said.\n\nWhile the last two years' competitions have seen an outpouring of support for Ukraine, this year \"we see Europe divided over the war in Gaza.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com",

Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits.\n\n\"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\"\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Norway and the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"},

The organisers of the march say the demonstration will take place at 3pm, with it ending at Molleplatsen park.\n\nOfficers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malmo Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid Israel facing calls to be excluded from the contest because of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, run by the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas, puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nOrganisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), hit out in April against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\"\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt also told Irish finalist Bambie Thug to change their body paint, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nIsrael, which performs towards the end of the night, has been a strong contender at Eurovision in recent years, last winning with Netta's Toy in 2018 and qualifying for the final 12 times since 2003.\n\nEden Golan of Israel\n\nIt has won a total of four times, and will face tough competition this year from Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop music The Code has been seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday.\n\nThe rehearsals have already shown Golan back bending in a white dress before emerging in a circle flanked by dancers as well as being bathed with yellow light as the song reaches its crescendo.\n\nThere were shouts at the rehearsals on Wednesday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nNetherlands act Joost Klein, with the irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with folkish Ulveham are also seen as likely to progress to the final.\n\nFrance's Slimane with the soulful Mon Amour will also perform on Thursday, alongside Italy's Angelina Mango with La Noia and Spain's Nebulossa with Zorra, but is already through to the final as one of the big EBU donators alongside the UK with Olly Alexander and Germany with Isaak.\n\nThe 2024 hosts of Eurovision are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin Akerman.\n\nBBC One and BBC iPlayer begin the broadcast of the second semi-final from 8pm on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_mclaughlin@mirror.co.uk",

Police estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 people took part. Among those in the crowd was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nChanting \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!\" and \"Israel is a terror state,\" the demonstrators set off smoke flares in the Palestinian colors during a noisy, peaceful rally to criticize Israel and call for a cease-fire. There was a large police presence, with a hovering helicopter, and officers on rooftops with binoculars.\n\nREAD MORE: Tens of thousands of Palestinians flee chaos in Rafah after Israel's seizure of border crossing\n\n\"It's important to be here,\" said Amani Eli-Ali, a Malmo resident of Palestinian heritage. \"It's not OK for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nProtester Saadallah Aoudi, a Swedish citizen with Palestinian roots, said \"this is the wrong time\" for Israel to take part in the competition.\n\n\"It's about songs, and songs are about love. ... They should be here when there is peace,\" he said.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians, has brought a jarring juxtaposition to Eurovision week in Malmo. Music fans in colorful sequined outfits or draped in their national flags mixed in the streets with supporters of the Palestinian cause in keffiyeh scarves.\n\nPalestinian flags fly from windows and balconies along a pedestrianized thoroughfare that has been temporarily renamed \"Eurovision street.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel protest was also held Thursday in a central Malmo square.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups plan to march again on Saturday, the day of the Eurovision final.\n\nIsrael's government warned its citizens of a \"tangible concern\" Israelis could be targeted for attack in Malmo during the contest.\n\nWATCH: ICJ rules Israel must protect Palestinians in genocide case, does not order cease fire\n\nContest organizers, who try to keep Eurovision a non-political event, have rejected calls to bar Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas.\n\nBut they told Israel to change the lyrics of its entry, originally titled \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and triggered the war. The song was renamed \"Hurricane\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nShe will compete in Thursday's semi-final. Some audience members attending a dress rehearsal on Wednesday could be heard to boo during Golan's performance.\n\nCritics of the decision to let Israel compete point out that Russia was kicked out of Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus was ejected a year earlier over its government's crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"We're supposed to be united by music but we're not united, because Israel is participating,\" said Malmo resident Anders Trolle-Schultz, who attended the protest.\n\n\"I think Malmo should have kept Eurovision, but we should have told Israel either 'Stay away,' or maybe even say, why don't we invite a Palestinian music group to participate? That would be fair.\"\n\nHistorian Dean Vuletic, author of \"Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest,\" said Eurovision has long been a focus of political controversies. Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus led to a Greek boycott the following year. Georgia pulled out of Eurovision in 2009, a year after it fought a brief war with Russia, after organizers rejected its proposed song, \"We Don't Wanna Put In\" -- an obvious reference to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Whenever countries compete with each other, things are going to get political,\" and Eurovision has always reflected the \"political zeitgeist\" in Europe, he said.\n\nWhile the last two years' competitions have seen an outpouring of support for Ukraine, this year \"we see Europe divided over the war in Gaza.\"", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType":

Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena.\n\nIsraeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits.\n\n\"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\"\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Norway and the Netherlands.\n\n(Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, Tom Little and Ilze Filks in Malmo and Johan Ahlander,

Organizers of the annual event admonished him, saying in a statement: \"We regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nSimilarly, Ireland's 2024 contestant, nonbinary \"ouija-pop\" star Bambie Thug, told reporters on May 7 that they had written \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine\" in an ancient Celtic writing known as Ogham on their face during dress rehearsals but were \"ordered\" to remove the writing for the semifinal performance.\n\nEurovision, officially known as the Eurovision Song Contest, has famously and historically claimed to be nonpolitical, as seen on the competition's official website:\n\nGiven that Eurovision is a contest won and lost along national lines, critics have called this claim into question over the decades since its inception in 1956. For example, one day after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Eurovision -- which is organized by the European Broadcasting Union -- banned Russia from competing, with the Eurovision chief citing \"ultimate values of democracy.\"\n\nIn spring 2024, calls for a boycott of the international event gained traction due to claims that Eurovision banned Palestinian flags and symbols from the event, which began on May 7, 2024, and was to continue through May 11, 2024. Calls for a boycott came as Israel entered its eighth month of a declared war on Hamas following the militant group's attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which it killed approximately 1,200 Israelis. As of this writing, Israel had killed more than 30,000 people and injured 72,889 in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to the United Nations.\n\nSo has Eurovision really banned Palestinian flags and symbols? The short answer is yes.\n\nTT, a Swedish news agency, reported that \"anyone who tries to bring a Palestinian flag or a sign with a political message will be stopped at the entrance by guards,\" according to The Associated Press. The EBU reserves the right \"to remove any other flags or symbols, clothing, items and banners being used for the likely purpose of instrumentalizing the TV shows,\" according to Michelle Roverelli, head of communications for the EBU. While this information is not available on either the Eurovision or the EBU website, the AP reported that Roverelli confirmed this via text message. In a New York Times story published May 2, 2024, a spokesperson for the EBU said that \"ticket buyers at this year's Eurovision Song Contest are allowed to bring and display only flags representing the 37 participating countries.\" We've reached out to the EBU via email to confirm this information.\n\nIsrael has been a longstanding participant in the event; it was the first country outside of Europe to be admitted as a contestant in 1973. Since then, Israel has hosted Eurovision three times (in 1979, 1999 and 2019) and won it on four occasions (in 1978, 1979, 1998 and 2018). Additionally, since 2020, Eurovision's \"presenting partner\" has been Israeli beauty company Moroccanoil.\n\nEurovision denied Israel's song submission for the 2024 competition, \"October Rain,\" for being too political, as it referenced Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Eden Golan, the Russian-Israeli representative of Israel for Eurovision 2024, planned to perform an altered version of the song, titled \"Hurricane,\" instead.\n\nTechnically, any state that is an active member of the European Broadcasting Union is eligible to compete. Palestine has never competed in Eurovision and was not a member of the EBU in 2024, although it was formerly an associate member.\n\nThe flag of Palestine -- recognized as a sovereign state by 142 of the 193 member states of the United Nations -- is not the only flag banned at Eurovision. Flags from any state not represented in the competition are not allowed, including the flag of the European Union. The only exception to this rule is the rainbow LGBTQ+ flag.\n\nAn internal document accidentally published online ahead of 2016's competition included examples of banned flags, according to CBC News.\n\nThat year, Eurovision threatened Armenia's contestant, singer Iveta Mukuchyan, with disqualification and threatened Armenia with sanctions for waving the flag of Nagorno-Karabakh (known by many as Artsakh) -- an ethnically Armenian region that Azerbaijan controls -- during a qualifying event.\n\nWhen Tel Aviv, Israel, hosted Eurovision in 2019, Icelandic representative band Hatari waved flags with the colors of the flag of Palestine at the end of their performance. Eurovision fined Icelandic broadcaster R\u00daV 5,000 euros, and the official Eurovision 2019 DVD censored the moment.\n\nIn the months leading up to Eurovision 2024, Palestinian pop singer Bashar Murad hoped to represent Iceland with a song he co-wrote with Einar St\u00e9fansson, one of Hatari's members. Murad made it through the semifinals, qualifying for the final, but ultimately he placed second to artist Hera Bj\u00f6rk, who represented Iceland at Eurovision 2024 and did not make it past the semifinal competition.\n\nAhead of Eurovision 2024, nine country's contestants - Bambie Thug of Ireland, G\u00e5te of Norway, Iolanda of Portugal, Megara of Spain, Nemo of Switzerland, Olly Alexander of the United Kingdom, Saba of Denmark, Silvester Belt of Lithuania and Windows95Man of Finland -- all signed a statement calling for an \"immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages.\"\n\nIn response to a question about people boycotting Eurovision in 2024 due to Israel's allowed participation, the contest's FAQ page states:\n\nWe've previously debunked a satirical claim that Palestine was granted permission to compete in Eurovision 2019.", "source": {"uri": "snopes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Snopes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHas Israel won Eurovision before?\n\nIsrael has won Eurovision four times, first in 1978 with Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta's \"A-Ba-Ni-Bi\", then again the following year with Milk and Honey singing \"Hallelujah\".\n\nIts next triumph was in 1998, in a historic moment where Dana International became the first transgender artist to win the Eurovision Song Contest with her song \"Diva\", turning her into a global icon.\n\nIsrael's most recent win was with Netta, who performed the eccentric pop song \"Toy\", in 2018.\n\nWho has been calling for a boycott?\n\nIn April, the collective Queers for Palestine circulated an open letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake, calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to withdraw from Eurovision 2024 in protest against Israel's participation.\n\nArtists and music organisations in Finland, Sweden, Ireland and Iceland have also protested against their countries' delegates taking part.\n\nMeanwhile, protests have taken place in Sweden as well as outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London, and in Barcelona, Amsterdam and Reykjavik.\n\nHow have Eurovision artists responded?\n\nAlexander and other Eurovision artists shared a statement in response to the Queers for Palestine letter, beginning by acknowledging the \"privilege of taking part in Eurovision\".\n\n\"In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent.\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages. We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and islamophobia.\"\n\nHis team continued with a message of optimism and a belief in the \"power of music\", adding: \"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.\n\n\"We feel it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"\n\nThe decision has led to online backlash with Queers For Palestine who organised the original letter, calling the statement \"condescending\" and accusing Alexander of a \"lack of concern, if not contempt for the Palestinian people of Gaza\".\n\nAlexander's response was branded \"disappointing\" by critics, with many on social media pointing to his history of activism and accusing him of hypocrisy.\n\nHowever, some Eurovision participants have continued to be vocal in their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, pushing back against the EBU's requests to keep the contest a \"non-political\" event.\n\nSwedish pop singer Eric Saade wore the Middle Eastern scarf around his wrist during a guest performance at the first semi-final of the contest in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, on Tuesday evening (7 May). The scarf has continually been used as a symbol of pro-Palestine support throughout Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nSaade's decision to wear the scarf was condemned by the EBU, who announced ahead of the competition that they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestine symbols at the show.\n\nIreland's Bambie Thug told a press conference in Malm\u00f6 that they were forced to change their body paint in Ogham script (an early Medieval alphabet), which translated to \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom\", a nod to the situation in Gaza and amid Israel's inclusion in the competition.\n\n\"It was very important for me because I'm pro justice and pro peace,\" Bambie said. \"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nWhat has the EBU said about the protests?\n\nIn April, the EBU issued its own statement condemning \"abuse or harassment\" directed at participants.\n\n\"The EBU recognises the strong emotions stirred by this year's Eurovision Song Contest and the intense debate sparked by the inclusion of an Israeli entry,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We would like to stress that any decisions regarding participation are the responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies, not the individual artists. We are firmly against any form of abuse or harassment directed at participants, online or offline, and are committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment.\n\n\"We advocate for constructive dialogue and support for the artists, underlining the Contest's mission to be United by Music.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

square before Eurovision protests", "body": "A heavy police presence has arrived at Malmo's main square ahead of protests against Israel's inclusion in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nOfficers in more than five vans arrived in Stortorget ahead of Eden Golan, representing Israel, taking to the stage on Thursday evening in Malmo Arena.\n\nThe Swedish Police Authority positioned themselves at various entrance points to the square as tourists walked around taking pictures of the fountain and the town hall.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place in the afternoon, which a spokesman for the force said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThe organisers of the march say the demonstration will take place at 3pm, with it ending at Molleplatsen park.\n\nOfficers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malmo Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid Israel facing calls to be excluded from the contest because of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, run by the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas, puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nJoost Klein of the Netherlands performs the song Europapa (Martin Meissner/AP)\n\nOrganisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), hit out in April against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt also told Irish finalist Bambie Thug to change their body paint, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nA man holds a Palestinian flag as he protests ahead of the first semi-final at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden (Martin Meissner/AP)\n\nIsrael, which performs towards the end of the night, has been a strong contender at Eurovision in recent years, last winning with Netta's Toy in 2018 and qualifying for the final 12 times since 2003.\n\nIt has won a total of four times, and will face tough competition this year from Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop music The Code has been seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday.\n\nThe rehearsals have already shown Golan back bending in a white dress before emerging in a circle flanked by dancers as well as being bathed with yellow light as the song reaches its crescendo.\n\nThere were shouts at the rehearsals on Wednesday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nNetherlands act Joost Klein, with the irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with folkish Ulveham are also seen as likely to progress to the final.\n\nFrance's Slimane with the soulful Mon Amour will also perform on Thursday, alongside Italy's Angelina Mango with La Noia and Spain's Nebulossa with Zorra, but is already through to the final as one of the big EBU donators alongside the UK with Olly Alexander and Germany with Isaak.\n\nThe 2024 hosts of Eurovision are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin Akerman.\n\nBBC One and BBC iPlayer begin the broadcast of the second semi-final from 8pm on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

There was a large police presence, with a hovering helicopter, and officers on rooftops with binoculars.\n\n\"It's important to be here,\" said Amani Eli-Ali, a Malmo resident of Palestinian heritage. \"It's not OK for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians, has brought a jarring juxtaposition to Eurovision week in Malmo. Music fans in colorful sequined outfits or draped in their national flags mixed in the streets with supporters of the Palestinian cause in keffiyeh scarves.\n\nPalestinian flags fly from windows and balconies along a pedestrianized thoroughfare that has been temporarily renamed \"Eurovision street.\"\n\nProtestors takes part in the Stop Israel demonstration between Stortorget and M\u00f6lleplatsen in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024. There have been calls for Israel to be excluded from the Eurovision Song contest because of its conduct in its war against Hamas. (Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency via AP)\n\nPro-Palestinian groups plan to march again on Saturday, the day of the Eurovision final.\n\nIsrael's government warned its citizens of a \"tangible concern\" Israelis could be targeted for attack in Malmo during the contest.\n\nContest organizers, who try to keep Eurovision a non-political event, have rejected calls to bar Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas.\n\nBut they told Israel to change the lyrics of its entry, originally titled \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and triggered the war. The song was renamed \"Hurricane\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nShe will compete in Thursday's semi-final. Some audience members attending a dress rehearsal on Wednesday could be heard to boo during Golan's performance.\n\nCritics of the decision to let Israel compete point out that Russia was kicked out of Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus was ejected a year earlier over its government's crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"We're supposed to be united by music but we're not united, because Israel is participating,\" said Malmo resident Anders Trolle-Schultz, who attended the protest.\n\n\"I think Malmo should have kept Eurovision, but we should have told Israel either 'Stay away,' or maybe even say, why don't we invite a Palestinian music group to participate?

She edited the lyrics and renamed the song, \"Hurricane.\"\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, the EBU defended the decision to allow Israel to participate, despite the ongoing conflict.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU.

Israel's military operation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nSixteen countries will compete in Thursday's semifinals, including Israel, with 10 moving on to the finals on Saturday.

Among those in the crowd was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nChanting \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" and \"Israel is a terror state,\" the demonstrators set off smoke flares in the Palestinian colours during a noisy, peaceful rally to criticize Israel and call for a ceasefire in Gaza. There was a large police presence, with a hovering helicopter, and officers on rooftops with binoculars.\n\n\"It's important to be here,\" said Amani Eli-Ali, a Malm\u00f6 resident of Palestinian heritage. \"It's not OK for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nProtester Saadallah Aoudi, a Swedish citizen with Palestinian roots, said \"this is the wrong time\" for Israel to take part in the competition: \"It's about songs, and songs are about love.... They should be here when there is peace.\"\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, has brought a jarring juxtaposition to Eurovision week in Malm\u00f6. Music fans in colourful sequined outfits or draped in their national flags mixed in the streets with supporters of the Palestinian cause in keffiyeh scarves. Palestinian flags are flying from windows and balconies along a pedestrianized thoroughfare that has been temporarily renamed \"Eurovision street.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel protest was also held Thursday in a central Malm\u00f6 square.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups plan to march again on Saturday, the day of the Eurovision final.\n\nIsrael's government warned its citizens of a \"tangible concern\" that Israelis could be targeted for attack in Malm\u00f6 during the contest.\n\nContest organizers, who try to keep Eurovision a non-political event, have rejected calls to bar Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas. But they told Israel to change the lyrics of its entry, originally titled October Rain in apparent reference to the Hamas-led cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.\n\nThe song was renamed Hurricane, with some of its lyrics changed, and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest. She will compete in Thursday's semifinal. Some audience members attending a dress rehearsal on Wednesday could be heard booing during Golan's performance.\n\nCritics of the decision to let Israel compete point out that Russia was kicked out of Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus was ejected a year earlier over its government's crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"We're supposed to be united by music, but we're not united, because Israel is participating,\" said Malm\u00f6 resident Anders Trolle-Schultz, who attended the protest. \"I think Malm\u00f6 should have kept Eurovision, but we should have told Israel, either 'Stay away,' or maybe even say, why don't we invite a Palestinian music group to participate? That would be fair.\"\n\nHistorian Dean Vuletic, author of Postwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest, said Eurovision has long been a focus of political controversies. Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus led to a Greek boycott the following year. Georgia pulled out of Eurovision in 2009, a year after it fought a brief war with Russia, when organizers rejected its proposed song, We Don't Wanna Put In -- an obvious reference to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Whenever countries compete with each other, things are going to get political,\" and Eurovision has always reflected the \"political zeitgeist\" in Europe, he said. While the last two years' competitions have seen an outpouring of support for Ukraine, this year \"we see Europe divided over the war in Gaza.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news",

Some called for Israel to be disqualified from the contest.\n\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, 21, was among the protesters.\n\nA pro-Israel demonstration is expected later.\n\nSwedish officers in more than five vans arrived in Stortorget ahead of Eden Golan, representing Israel, taking to the stage on Thursday evening in Malmo Arena.\n\nThe Swedish Police Authority positioned themselves at various entrance points to the square as tourists walked around taking pictures of the fountain and the town hall.\n\nOfficers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malmo Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid Israel facing calls to be excluded from the contest because of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, run by the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas, puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nOrganisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), hit out in April against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt also told Irish finalist Bambie Thug to change their body paint, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nIsrael, which performs towards the end of the night, has been a strong contender at Eurovision in recent years, last winning with Netta's Toy in 2018 and qualifying for the final 12 times since 2003.\n\nIt has won a total of four times, and will face tough competition this year from Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop music The Code has been seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday.\n\nThe rehearsals have already shown Golan back bending in a white dress before emerging in a circle flanked by dancers as well as being bathed with yellow light as the song reaches its crescendo.\n\nThere were shouts at the rehearsals on Wednesday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nNetherlands act Joost Klein, with the irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with folkish Ulveham are also seen as likely to progress to the final.\n\nFrance's Slimane with the soulful Mon Amour will also perform on Thursday, alongside Italy's Angelina Mango with La Noia and Spain's Nebulossa with Zorra, but is already through to the final as one of the big EBU donators alongside the UK with Olly Alexander and Germany with Isaak.\n\nThe 2024 hosts of Eurovision are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin Akerman.", "source": {"uri":

There was a large police presence, with a hovering helicopter, and officers on rooftops with binoculars.\n\n\"It\u00b4s important to be here,\" said Amani Eli-Ali, a Malmo resident of Palestinian heritage. \"It\u00b4s not OK for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians, has brought a jarring juxtaposition to Eurovision week in Malmo. Music fans in colorful sequined outfits or draped in their national flags mixed in the streets with supporters of the Palestinian cause in keffiyeh scarves.\n\nA protester shouts into a megaphone during a Pro-Palestinian demonstration for excluding Israel from Eurovision ahead of the second semi-final at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\n\nPalestinian flags fly from windows and balconies along a pedestrianized thoroughfare that has been temporarily renamed \"Eurovision street.\"\n\nPro-Palestinian groups plan to march again on Saturday, the day of the Eurovision final.\n\nIsrael\u00b4s government warned its citizens of a \"tangible concern\" Israelis could be targeted for attack in Malmo during the contest.\n\nContest organizers, who try to keep Eurovision a non-political event, have rejected calls to bar Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas.\n\nBut they told Israel to change the lyrics of its entry, originally titled \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas\u00b4 cross-border Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and triggered the war. The song was renamed \"Hurricane\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nShe will compete in Thursday\u00b4s semi-final. Some audience members attending a dress rehearsal on Wednesday could be heard to boo during Golan\u00b4s performance.\n\nCritics of the decision to let Israel compete point out that Russia was kicked out of Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus was ejected a year earlier over its government\u00b4s crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"We\u00b4re supposed to be united by music but we\u00b4re not united, because Israel is participating,\" said Malmo resident Anders Trolle-Schultz, who attended the protest.\n\n\"I think Malmo should have kept Eurovision, but we should have told Israel either 'Stay away,\u00b4 or maybe even say, why don\u00b4t we invite a Palestinian music group to participate? That would be fair.\"\n\nProtestors takes part in the Stop Israel demonstration between Stortorget and M\u00f6lleplatsen in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, Thursday, May 9, 2024.

Some 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for the annual kitsch-fest, which is taking place amid protests and boycotts over the Israeli military campaign in Gaza that was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nEurovision fans dressed in quirky outfits, sequins and their national colours arrived for the event, while around a hundred protesters chanted \"boycott Israel\" and \"shame on you\" outside the venue before being ushered away by police. Climate activist Greta Thunberg earlier in the day joined more than 10,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the centre of Malmo who object to Israel's participation in the musical contest.\n\nPolice said protests were largely calm. Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act. Protester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\" Swedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, which is hosting the competition, and snipers were visible on buildings in the arena. Israeli contestant Eden Golan, 20, will perform her song \"Hurricane\". In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation.\n\n\"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said. 'HYPOCRISY AND DOUBLE STANDARDS'\n\nProtester Amar, a Palestinian who declined to give his second name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\" \"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nA smaller pro-Israel demonstration was held later on Thursday, a few hundred metres from the pro-Palestinian protest, with attendants holding hands and dancing in a circle to old Israeli Eurovision hits. \"I'm here to defend Israel,\" said Rolf, 70, from the Swedish city of Lund, declining to give his second name.\n\n\"We are only a little group, but we want to be seen as well. I think it's a shame that this girl from Israel who is performing today has to stand against all this... She certainly feels the pressure.\" The EBU has resisted calls for Israel to be excluded but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help to unite people. \"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThursday's semi-final will also feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Norway and the Netherlands.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Among those in the crowd was the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\n\"It's important to be here,\" Amani Eli-Ali, a Malmo resident of Palestinian heritage, told AP. \"It's not OK for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nProtester Saadallah Aoudi, a Swedish citizen with Palestinian roots, added that \"this is the wrong time\" for Israel to take part in the competition.\n\n\"It's about songs, and songs are about love. ...

Eurovision protests | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "By Charlotte McLaughlin, PA Senior Entertainment Reporter in Malmo, Sweden\n\nA heavy police presence has arrived at Malmo's main square ahead of protests against Israel's inclusion in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nOfficers in more than five vans arrived in Stortorget ahead of Eden Golan, representing Israel, taking to the stage on Thursday evening in Malmo Arena.\n\nThe Swedish Police Authority positioned themselves at various entrance points to the square as tourists walked around taking pictures of the fountain and the town hall.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place in the afternoon, which a spokesman for the force said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThe organisers of the march say the demonstration will take place at 3pm, with it ending at Molleplatsen park.\n\nOfficers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malmo Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid Israel facing calls to be excluded from the contest because of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, run by the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas, puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nOrganisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), hit out in April against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt also told Irish finalist Bambie Thug to change their body paint, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nIsrael, which performs towards the end of the night, has been a strong contender at Eurovision in recent years, last winning with Netta's Toy in 2018 and qualifying for the final 12 times since 2003.\n\nIt has won a total of four times, and will face tough competition this year from Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop music The Code has been seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday.\n\nThe rehearsals have already shown Golan back bending in a white dress before emerging in a circle flanked by dancers as well as being bathed with yellow light as the song reaches its crescendo.\n\nThere were shouts at the rehearsals on Wednesday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nNetherlands act Joost Klein, with the irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with folkish Ulveham are also seen as likely to progress to the final.\n\nFrance's Slimane with the soulful Mon Amour will also perform on Thursday, alongside Italy's Angelina Mango with La Noia and Spain's Nebulossa with Zorra, but is already through to the final as one of the big EBU donators alongside the UK with Olly Alexander and Germany with Isaak.\n\nThe 2024 hosts of Eurovision are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin Akerman.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking

It's a huge amount of power and honour I have to be the voice of millions of people and show that we're here and be the voice of people who are not home right now and we need to bring home.\"\n\nThe Hamas-Israel conflict has led to over 34,000 Palestinians being killed since fighting began in October.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place on Thursday, which the Swedish Police Authority said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nHowever, Israel - which has been competing since joining the EBU in 1973 - is set to take part in the contest. The country has previously won in 1978, 1979, 1998 and 2018.\n\nAhead of the event at Malmo Arena, fans have been warned not to bring Palestinian flags, symbols or bags and have been told that there will be \"vigorous security checks\".\n\nThe terrorist threat level is on four points out of five, but the Swedish Police Authority has said that this is not related to the contest.\n\nFollowing the outbreak, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nFinnish, Swedish, Irish and Icelandic musical artists have also called for Israel to be prevented from competing and for their acts to not go along to the contest.\n\nOn April 25, protests were held outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London by the LGTBQ+ solidarity group Queers For Palestine. Similar demonstrations were also held in Barcelona, Amsterdam and Reykjavik.\n\nHowever, Eurovision host Rylan Clark has defended the Eurovision Song Contest ahead of further protests over Israel's participation.\n\nYears and Years singer Alexander, Irish entrant Bambie Thug along with Norway's Gate, Portugal's Iolanda, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo, Lithuanian singer Silvester Belt and Finland's Windows95Man/Teemu Keisteri have all rejected calls to boycott the contest.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement they did call for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages\" and said they \"stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia\".\n\nOn Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the EBU said if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\" as an apolitical member organisation.\n\nHe also said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\nThe EBU had come under fire for allowing Israel to compete at a time of war while also banning Russia from competing after it invaded Ukraine.Russia has not competed since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and nor has Belarus.\n\nThe Eurovision website states that \"Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place on Thursday ahead of the second semi-final, which the Swedish Police Authority said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nEurovision host Rylan Clark has defended the decision to include Israel in Eurovision 2024 saying people have \"the right\" to protest but the song contest is \"just about the music.\"\n\nClark, who is hosting the BBC's coverage of the competition alongside Graham Norton and Scott Mills, told ITV's Good Morning Britain: \"Malmo is doing an amazing job of hosting Eurovision.\n\n\"The climate in the world at the minute isn't great and you know we're not silly to not understand that there's a lot going on in the world, but I think in the Eurovision bubble it's a song contest, it's all about the music and that's what we're here for.\n\n\"The city has done an amazing job, there's a lot of demonstrations happening and people have got the right to do that and but it's just about the music.\"\n\nMills added: \"It does feel a little different but it's about the music and the joy that we have every single year at Eurovision.\"\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nThe

Eden Golan, the 20-year-old singer representing Israel with her song \"Hurricane,\" drew both cheers and boos during a dress rehearsal on Wednesday in advance of the second semifinal on Thursday. Bookmakers have ranked Israel in the top 10 likely victors, which would land Golan among 26 contestants in the final on Saturday.\n\nLocals in Malm\u00f6, which has a longstanding reputation for antisemitism and a record of attacks on Jews by both neo-Nazis and members of the substantial Muslim immigrant minority, unsuccessfully petitioned the city to bar Israel from competing. (The last time the city hosted the contest, in 2013, Jews and non-Jews held a rally after Israeli fans reported harassment.)\n\nNow, Malm\u00f6 is brimming with Swedish police, along with reinforcements from Denmark and Norway, ahead of demonstrations against Israel's participation, including a boat march that took place on Wednesday. Police expect over 20,000 protesters in the small city's streets, outnumbering about 15,000 people holding tickets to gather in the Malm\u00f6 Arena. Outside of Malm\u00f6, Eurovision is expected to draw more than 150 million people to TV screens worldwide.\n\nParticipants hold up banners during a demonstration outside the City Hall in Malm\u00f6, Sweden on April 10, 2024 in connection with the municipal board's consideration of a citizens' proposal to stop Israel's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. (Johan Nilsson/TT News Agency/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIsrael's inclusion in the contest sparked international backlash because of its deadly military campaign in Gaza. Over 160,000 people have signed a petition to ban Israel from Eurovision, while 20 artists dropped out from performing in events surrounding the contest. Some protest groups have organized alternative events in Malm\u00f6, such as \"FalastinVision,\" billed as a \"genocide-free song contest\" hosting 15 artists from eight countries -- including the Palestinian territories -- at a live show scheduled for the same time as Eurovision's final.\n\nAmong the artists performing at FalastinVision is Bashar Murad, a Palestinian singer who competed to represent Iceland in Eurovision this year and lost to Hera Bj\u00f6rk.\n\n\"Palestine is blocked from major events around the world -- including Eurovision -- so it's difficult for Palestinian artists to showcase our culture and art globally,\" Murad said in a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \"FalastinVision is a beautiful way to address that.\"\n\nBoycotters have accused Eurovision of a double standard for including Israel after excluding Russia from its contest in 2022, one day after Russian troops invaded Ukraine. Noel Curran, head of the EBU, has maintained that Russia was cut off for failing to meet broadcaster guidelines that Israel has met.\n\n\"Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make,\" Curran said in a statement. \"In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\"\n\nAs part of Eurovision's \"non-political\" guidelines, the contest bars flags and signs other than the national flags of participants and the rainbow pride flag -- which means that Palestinian flags are not allowed in the venue.\n\nOn Tuesday, opening act performer Eric Saade -- a former Swedish contestant of Palestinian origin -- wore a keffiyeh on his wrist, a scarf seen as symbolizing Palestinian solidarity. Saade was reprimanded by the EBU, which said in a statement, \"We regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nEden Golan performs an emotional rendition of Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing,\" surrounded by empty chairs representing the missing hostages, for her grand finale performance to represent Israel in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest. (Screenshot via Mako.co.il)\n\nThe EBU also cited politicization concerns as its reason for rejecting Golan's initial song entry, titled \"October Rain.\" The song appeared to reference Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, took more than 250 hostage and triggered Israel's military assault in Gaza. Golan tweaked the song and renamed it \"Hurricane,\" although its lyrics could still be interpreted as a reaction to Oct. 7.\n\nFor many Israelis, the country's participation and success in the contest is a point of pride and an antidote to concerns -- heightened this year amid the war -- that Israel is isolated on the world stage. Israel was accepted into the contest in 1957, its second year, causing Egypt and Syria to exit. It competed for the first time in 1973 and has since won four times, most recently for \"Toy\" by Netta in 2018.\n\nGolan is largely staying out of view during Eurovision week for fear of security threats, skipping most events other than the live shows and rehearsals. In lieu of the contest's opening \"turquoise carpet\" event on Sunday, she went to a local ceremony marking Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nFredrik Sieradzki, who heads the Jewish Learning Center in Malm\u00f6, said he welcomed Golan together with the Israeli delegation. Malm\u00f6 is home to a small Jewish community of about 1,000 people, including some parents who have complained of antisemitic incidents at their children's schools since Oct. 7, according to Sieradzki.\n\n\"Eden Golan lit one of the candles. We lit six candles and the seventh one, of course, for the latest victims,\" Sieradzki told JTA, referring to the people killed on Oct. 7. \"It was a very emotional get-together, we felt we were family. When Jews come here, we welcome them.\"\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Golan avoided criticizing the protests against her performance.\n\n\"It's up to the people what to do,\" she said. \"They have the right to speak their voice, but I'm focusing on my part which is giving the best performance, and on the good, on the good vibes, the good people.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType":

1:47 PM\n\nBy Charlotte McLaughlin, PA Senior Entertainment Reporter in Malmo, Sweden\n\nA heavy police presence has arrived at Malmo's main square ahead of protests against Israel's inclusion in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nOfficers in more than five vans arrived in Stortorget ahead of Eden Golan, representing Israel, taking to the stage on Thursday evening in Malmo Arena.\n\nThe Swedish Police Authority positioned themselves at various entrance points to the square as tourists walked around taking pictures of the fountain and the town hall.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place in the afternoon, which a spokesman for the force said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThe organisers of the march say the demonstration will take place at 3pm, with it ending at Molleplatsen park.\n\nOfficers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malmo Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid Israel facing calls to be excluded from the contest because of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, run by the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas, puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nOrganisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), hit out in April against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and

Thug to change their body paint, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nIsrael, which performs towards the end of the night, has been a strong contender at Eurovision in recent years, last winning with Netta's Toy in 2018 and qualifying for the final 12 times since 2003.\n\nIt has won a total of four times, and will face tough competition this year from Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop music The Code has been seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday.\n\nThe rehearsals have already shown Golan back bending in a white dress before emerging in a circle flanked by dancers as well as being bathed with yellow light as the song reaches its crescendo.\n\nThere were shouts at the rehearsals on Wednesday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nNetherlands act Joost Klein, with the irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with folkish Ulveham are also seen as likely to progress to the final.\n\nFrance's Slimane with the soulful Mon Amour will also perform on Thursday, alongside Italy's Angelina Mango with La Noia and Spain's Nebulossa with Zorra, but is already through to the final as one of the big EBU donators alongside the UK with Olly Alexander and Germany with Isaak.\n\nThe 2024 hosts of Eurovision are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin Akerman.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 9 May 2024, 1:16 PM Last updated: Thu

What Israel's Eurovision entry has said about Gaza conflict", "body": "Israel's Eurovision contestant was booed during a dress rehearsal on Wednesday ahead of her performance tonight in the second semi-final.\n\nEden Golan was performing her song \"Hurricane\" ahead of Thursday's semi-final in Malmo, Sweden. In response, she said she was \"proud to represent my country.\"\n\nIsrael has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, including more than 14,000 children since October 7. The country is currently invading Rafah, the southern part of Gaza the Israeli government once labelled as a \"safe zone.\" The United Nations humanitarian aid agency warned last Friday this would put hundreds of thousands of people would be \"at imminent risk of death.\"\n\nThe war on Gaza has sparked widespread protests around the world, with more than 54,000 people signing an online petition calling for Israel to be banned from the competition. The refusal of the EBU to ban Israel, has left many fans calling for a boycott of the competition.\n\nSpeaking about allowing Israel to compete in the competition, the deputy director general of the EBU, Jean Philip De Tender, said banning the country would be a \"political decision.\" However, critics have been quick to point out how Russia were banned from the competition after it launched it war on Ukraine.\n\nEurovision organisers are expecting political protests in Malmo on Thursday and for Saturday's final.\n\nWho is Eden Golan?\n\nEden Golan, is a singer of Russian-Israeli descent and kickstarted her career by participating in the Russian selection for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2015, followed by a stint on the Russian television show, The Voice Kids.\n\nLeading up to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2024, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation opted to collaborate with the Keshet 12 channel and the talent show Rising Star to select the country's contestant.\n\nGolan emerged victorious through all phases of the competition, captivating audiences with renditions of Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" and Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" during the final.\n\nNow, she's making waves as Israel's representative in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest with controversial song \"Hurricane\".\n\nIt comes after her initial selection, originally submitted a song called \"October Rain\", which was widely thought to reference the Hamas attacks of 7 October after they included the lines: \"There's no air left to breathe\" and \"They were all good children, each one of them.\"\n\nThe EBU, confirmed it was \"scrutinising\" Israel's chosen song due to its lyrical content, before Israeli president Isaac Herzog intervened and called for \"necessary adjustments\" to ensure the country could take part in the competition and they updated the song - called \"Hurricane\".\n\nThe organisers have now said they will allow Israel to compete following the lyrics change.\n\nWhat has she said about the Israel-Gaza conflict?\n\nSpeaking to Reuters, Eden Golan she said: \"I come here to show my voice, to share my love, my gift from God and to hopefully make people feel something and leave a mark in their souls and to unite by music.\"\n\nAsked how she feels about the possibility of protests in Malmo, Golan added:\n\n\"It's up to the people what to do. They have the right to speak their voice, but I'm focusing on my part which is giving the best performance, and on the good, on the good vibes, the good people.\"\n\nGolan will now take to the stage tonight at 8pm in the Eurovision 2024 second semi-final which will be broadcast on BBC One.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Here we go again. Eurovision wraps up in Sweden with pomp and protests.", "body": "Eden Golan of Israel performs the song \"Hurricane\" during the dress rehearsal for the second semi-final at the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, May 8, 2024.\n\nScores of musicians, hundreds of journalists, and thousands of music fans have gathered in the Swedish city of Malmo, where the Eurovision Song Contest is building towards an exuberant, glitter-drenched final on May 11.\n\nBut even Eurovision can't escape the world's divisions. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are also expected in the city for demonstrations urging a cease-fire in the Gaza war and criticizing Israel's participation in the contest.\n\nHere's a guide to what Eurovision means, how it works, and what to watch for:\n\nThe short answer: Eurovision is a music competition, in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music.\n\nThe longer answer is that Eurovision is an extravaganza that melds pop, partying, and politics - a cross between a music festival, an awards show, and a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. It's an event full of silly fun, a celebration of music's unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.\n\nThirty-seven countries are entered in the contest, which this year is taking place over several days in the Swedish port city of Malmo. The country is hosting after Swedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, England.\n\nThrough two semifinals, 37 acts are narrowed to the 26 who will compete in the May 11 finale in front of thousands of spectators in the Malmo Arena and a global television audience estimated at 180 million.\n\nNations can enter a solo act or a band. They can perform in any genre and language, but the rules state they must sing live and songs must be no more than three minutes long. Staging has grown ever more elaborate, incorporating flashy pyrotechnics and elaborate choreography. This year is particularly strong on topless male dancers.\n\nOnce all the acts have performed, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build. Ending up with \"nul points,\" or zero, ranks as a national humiliation.\n\nThe musical style of Eurovision has diversified dramatically since the contest was founded in 1956. The early years of crooners and ballads gave way to perky pop - epitomized by perhaps the greatest Eurovision song of all time, ABBA's \"Waterloo,\" which won the contest 50 years ago.\n\nNowadays, Euro-techno and power ballads remain popular, but viewers have also shown a taste for rock, folk-rap, and eccentric, unclassifiable songs.\n\nAccording to bookmakers, a leading contender is Swiss singer Nemo, who is performing a melodic, operatic song titled \"The Code.\" Nemo would be the first performer who identifies as nonbinary to win the contest, which has a huge LGBTQ+ following. The contest had its first transgender winner, Dana International, a quarter century ago.\n\nAnother nonbinary performer generating huge buzz is Ireland's Bambie Thug, whose song \"Doomsday Blue\" is Gothic, intense, over the top, and a real crowd-pleaser. They're the only contestant known to have brought a \"scream coach\" to Malmo. Ireland has won Eurovision seven times - a total equaled only by Sweden - but has fared poorly in recent years.\n\nOther acts tipped to do well include operatic Slovenian singer Raiven, Ukrainian rap-pop duo Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil, and Spain's Nebulosa, whose song \"Zorra\" caused a stir because its title can be translated as an anti-female slur.\n\nSo far, the act with the most momentum is Croatian singer Baby Lasagna. His song \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is quintessential Eurovision: exuberant, silly, a little emotional, and incredibly catchy. It's already a huge fan favorite.\n\nEurovision's motto is \"united by music,\" and its organizer, the European Broadcasting Union, strives to keep politics out of the contest. But it often intrudes.\n\nBelarus was expelled from Eurovision in 2021 over its government's clampdown on dissent, and Russia was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis year, there have been calls for Israel to be excluded because of its conduct in its war against Hamas.\n\nIsrael is competing, but was told to change the title of its song, originally called \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border attack. It's now called \"Hurricane\" and will be performed by singer Eden Golan at the May 9 semifinal.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups are planning large protests on May 9 and May 11, and Swedish police are mounting a major security operation, with officers from across the country bolstered by reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nPalestinian flags hang from some apartment balconies in Malmo but have been banned from the televised event, along with all flags apart from those of competing nations. At the first semifinal's opening act, one performer managed to sneak in a political statement, singing with a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf tied around his wrist.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, said it regretted Swedish singer Eric Saade's decision to \"compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news",

Simply magnificent!!!\n\nAnother said: \"#Israel bringing a song that could be the new hit from a Disney movie.\"\n\nEden cheered and thanked viewers as Israel were named as the fifth country on the night to make the grand final.\n\nSweden's third largest city was flooded with demonstrators waving Palestinian flags on Thursday to protest Israel's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest this week.\n\nGolan, 20, is due to perform at the second semi-final of the competition later this evening but has been ordered to stay in her hotel room by her country's national security agency Shin Bet.\n\nIt was reported earlier that Shin Bet had warned Golan not to step outside except for performances over fears for her own safety.\n\nMalmo had been anticipating the wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and it was feared the young Israeli-Russian singer could find herself at risk.\n\nAs many as 5,000 people have taken to Malmo's streets today, with smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag being set off and protesters carrying signs displaying images of Gaza victims.\n\nAmongst the large number protesting against Israel's inclusion in Eurovision, however, was climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThe young Swede was pictured wearing a keffiyeh - a black and white shawl commonly used to show support for Palestine - around her body in the centre of the crowd.\n\nSurrounded by a sea of Palestinian flags, she told Reuters news agency: \"Young people are leading the way and showing the world how we should react to this.\"\n\nShe refused to comment on why she had joined the protest, however, only saying it was \"good\" as the march took place.\n\nSome protesters had even brought along their dogs and young children to join in the march, while others held banners displaying anti-Eurovision messages.\n\nOne read \"welcome to Genocide song contest\", while \"stop using Eurovision to whitewash Israeli crimes\" was written on another.\n\nThere was even a banner done in the style of Eurovision with the word \"genocide\" on it, an accusation vigorously denied by Israel amid the country's war with Hamas following the terror group's October 7 attack.\n\nDuring the march, chants of \"Eurovision shame on you! Blood is on your hands too!\" rung out around downtown Malmo.\n\nWhile the sound of police helicopters circling overhead couldn't drown them out, officers on the ground managed to intervene and stop some of the protesters in their tracks.\n\nThere was a significant police presence in the square as Swedish authorities heighten security ahead of possible unrest.\n\nMalmo had already been taken over by approximately 100,000 visitors for the annual kitsch-fest before 5,000 protesters made themselves known.\n\nSecurity fears ahead of the remainder of Eurovision have only increased as a result, with the final taking place on Saturday.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, the host venue, where visitors must pass through metal detectors before entering.\n\nBags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses, with organisers concerned political demonstrations could take place in the crowd.\n\nGolan is expected to perform her song Hurricane in tonight's semi final, a piece reworked from an early track October Rain - thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas.\n\nDuring her rehearsals on Wednesday, however, she was booed and there were reported shouts of \"free Palestine\".\n\nGolan vowed that \"nothing will deter\" her after the performance was interrupted by protesters, vowing that she was \"proud to represent my country\".\n\nOthers in the large crowd did applaud her, though, and the young singer hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she said earlier this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nIsrael's involvement in the competition has been met with fierce criticism due to the country's ongoing war against Hamas inside the Gaza Strip.\n\nHowever, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, has dismissed calls for Israel to be excluded.\n\nThe competition bills itself as a non-political event and can disqualify countries who break that neutrality rules.\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 7pm (GMT) and will feature contestants from Malta, Albania, Greece, the Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType":

"body": "A heavy police presence has built up outside Eurovision's Malmo Arena after pro-Palestine protesters drowned out the rehearsal of Israel's entrant.\n\nEden Golan, 20, took to the stage on Wednesday for her dress rehearsal ahead of the second semi-final of the song contest.\n\nHer performance was met with booing from the crowd and videos posted to social media showed the vocal disapproval of the country's involvement in the contest amid the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nShe will take to the stage in front of the Eurovision crowd for the first time on Thursday evening, and more than five police vans have already gathered outside the Malmo Arena ahead of the event.\n\nIn a statement following the rehearsal of her song Hurricane, Golan said: \"I am proud to represent my country, particularly this year.\n\n\"I am receiving support and love and I am determined to give my best performance tomorrow in the semi-final and nothing will deter me from that goal!\"\n\nIt comes amid heightened tensions at the 68th Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, over Israel's involvement in the event.\n\nPolice officers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malmo Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid the threat of protests and disruption.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place on Thursday afternoon, which a spokesman for the force said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThe organisers of the march say the demonstration, which will end at Molleplatsen Park, will take place at 3pm.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nHer emotional track Hurricane was reworked from a previous song called October Rain, which was renamed after it was thought to reference the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThe contest has so far been plagued by rows over Israel's participation amid the country's ongoing military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month.\n\nAt the opening ceremony on Tuesday, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, expressed \"regret\" that a Swedish star had taken to the stage wearing a distinctive keffiyeh to show his support for Palestine.\n\nIn an Instagram story, pop star Eric Saade explained that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt has been made clear to attendees and contestants that Eurovision is a non-political event and therefore no political statements are permitted.\n\nIreland's non-binary entrant Bambie Thug revealed after their performance on Tuesday night that they had been barred from writing \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine\" on their body.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference after the first semi-final, they said: \"It was very important to me [to include those messages] because I'm pro-justice and pro-peace.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" they revealed, \"I had to change those messages today to just \"crown the witch\" in an order from the EBU.\"\n\nThe EBU also announced last week that they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags or pro-Palestine symbols at the show this week, which runs from Tuesday to Saturday.\n\nTicket holders are only allowed to bring and display flags representing countries that are taking part in the event, as well as the rainbow-coloured flag.\n\nIn April, the organisers hit out against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nIsrael, which performs towards the end of the night on Thursday, has been a

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIsrael will compete in this year's Eurovision Song Contest, despite calls for the country to be banned from participating due to its ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nEden Golan is representing Israel with the track \"Hurricane\", which was reworked from original entry \"October Rain\" after it was alleged to include references to the 7 October attacks by Hamas, therefore breaching the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) rules over political songs.\n\nThe Israel-born Golan, who grew up in Russia, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nShe is due to compete in the second semi-final on Thursday 9 May, where she will be up against favourites including Switzerland's Nemo with \"The Code\", and the Netherlands' Joost with \"Europapa\".\n\nProtests over Israel's participation are underway in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, which is hosting this year's contest following Swedish contestant Loreen's win with \"Tattoo\" in 2023.\n\nNon-European countries are still allowed to take part in Eurovision if they become a member of the EBU, the organiser behind the event.\n\nThis means that countries such as Israel, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Australia are allowed to compete.\n\nThe EBU has defended its decision to permit Israel to take part and rejected comparisons to Russia, which was banned from participating in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and a violation of \"public service media values\".\n\nSpeaking on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) which organises Eurovision, said it based its decision to include Kan on the competition rules in place.\n\n\"I fully agree it is a family event and the great thing about this music competition is that it's all about values,\" he said. \"It's about uniting onstage all of these young talents, these participants, and they do great. It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nIsrael has won Eurovision four times, first in 1978 with Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta's \"A-Ba-Ni-Bi\", then again the following year with Milk and Honey singing \"Hallelujah\".\n\nIts next triumph was in 1998, in a historic moment where Dana International became the first transgender artist to win the Eurovision Song Contest with her song \"Diva\", turning her into a global icon.\n\nIsrael's most recent win was with Netta, who performed the eccentric pop song \"Toy\", in 2018.\n\nIn April, the collective Queers for Palestine circulated an open letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake, calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to withdraw from Eurovision 2024 in protest against Israel's participation.\n\nArtists and music organisations in Finland, Sweden, Ireland and Iceland have also protested against their countries' delegates taking part.\n\nMeanwhile, protests have taken place in Sweden as well as outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London, and in Barcelona, Amsterdam and Reykjavik.\n\nAlexander and other Eurovision artists shared a statement in response to the Queers for Palestine letter, beginning by acknowledging the \"privilege of taking part in Eurovision\".\n\n\"In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent.\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages. We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and islamophobia.\"\n\nHis team continued with a message of optimism and a belief in the \"power of music\", adding: \"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.\n\n\"We feel it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"\n\nThe decision has led to online backlash with Queers For Palestine who organised the original letter, calling the statement \"condescending\" and accusing Alexander of a \"lack of concern, if not contempt for the Palestinian people of Gaza\".\n\nAlexander's response was branded \"disappointing\" by critics, with many on social media pointing to his history of activism and accusing him of hypocrisy.\n\nHowever, some Eurovision participants have continued to be vocal in their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, pushing back against the EBU's requests to keep the contest a \"non-political\" event.\n\nSwedish pop singer Eric Saade wore the Middle Eastern scarf around his wrist during a guest performance at the first semi-final of the contest in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, on Tuesday evening (7 May). The scarf has continually been used as a symbol of pro-Palestine support throughout Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nSaade's decision to wear the scarf was condemned by the EBU, who announced ahead of the competition that they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestine symbols at the show.\n\nIreland's Bambie Thug told a press conference in Malm\u00f6 that they were forced to change their body paint in Ogham script (an early Medieval alphabet), which translated to \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom\", a nod to the situation in Gaza and amid Israel's inclusion in the competition.\n\n\"It was very important for me because I'm pro justice and pro peace,\" Bambie said. \"Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said: \"The writing seen on Bambie Thug's body during dress rehearsals contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event.\n\n\"After discussions with the Irish delegation, they agreed to change the text for the live show.\"\n\nIn April, the EBU issued its own statement condemning \"abuse or harassment\" directed at participants.\n\n\"The EBU recognises the strong emotions stirred by this year's Eurovision Song Contest and the intense debate sparked by the inclusion of an Israeli entry,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We would like to stress that any decisions regarding participation are the responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies, not the individual artists. We are firmly against any form of abuse or harassment directed at participants, online or offline, and are committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment.\n\n\"We advocate for constructive dialogue and support for the artists, underlining the Contest's mission to be United by Music.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

She is not only an exceptional performer, but a symbol of strength and resilience. We \u2764\ufe0f you Eden and our entire country is cheering you on.\"\n\nLast month, the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the competition, released a statement condemning harassment and attacks against Golan on social media.\n\nThe popular European show drew in an audience of 216 million people last year, according to the European Broadcasting Union, almost twice as many as this year's Super Bowl.\n\nMORE: By the Numbers: Eurovision song contest\n\nThe EBU reportedly refused Israel's entry to the competition twice, saying the lyrics to songs it had chosen were too political, according to Euronews.\n\nA submission from Golan called \"October Rain\" was objected to by the EBU because the title and some of the songs were overtly political, according to The New York Times. She edited the lyrics and renamed the song, \"Hurricane.\"\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, the EBU defended the decision to allow Israel to participate, despite the ongoing conflict.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments,\" EBU Director General Noel Curran said in a Jan. 31 statement.\n\n\"As a member-led organization, our governing bodies -- the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board -- did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years,\" Curran said.\n\nMORE: Destruction in Gaza: Side-by-side aerial look at the Israel-Hamas war's devastating damage\n\nFacing backlash over the move in light of Russia being excluded in 2022 after the invasion of Ukraine, Curran said the relationship between Israeli broadcaster KAN and the Israeli government is \"fundamentally different to the relationship that exists between those Russian Members and the State.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the many voices calling to exclude Israel from this year's competition in the same way as we excluded the Russian broadcaster in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine,\" Curran said. \"Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make. In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\"\n\nIsrael launched an incursion into the Gaza Strip following an unprecedented terrorist attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government. Israel's military operation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nSixteen countries will compete in Thursday's semifinals, including Israel, with 10 moving on to the finals on Saturday. The winners are determined by a jury of music professionals and a public vote.\n\nIsrael has won the competition -- which started in 1956 -- four times, most recently in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronews", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euronews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XJl867zhxeeku5aoC.GAkg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04NjA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/42bf9383e3c02bbc815da81595d40a10", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-31", "textStart": 2192, "textEnd": 2199}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3576, "textEnd": 3582}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Malmo's main square before Eurovision protests", "body": "Officers in more than five vans arrived in Stortorget ahead of Eden Golan, representing Israel, taking to the stage on Thursday evening in Malmo Arena.\n\nThe Swedish Police Authority positioned themselves at various entrance points to the square as tourists walked around taking pictures of the fountain and the town hall.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place in the afternoon, which a spokesman for the force said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThe organisers of the march say the demonstration will take place at 3pm, with it ending at Molleplatsen park.\n\nOfficers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malmo Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid Israel facing calls to be excluded from the contest because of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, run by the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas, puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nOrganisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), hit out in April against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt also told Irish finalist Bambie Thug to change their body paint, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nIsrael, which performs towards the end of the night, has been a strong contender at Eurovision in recent years, last winning with Netta's Toy in 2018 and qualifying for the final 12 times since 2003.\n\nIt has won a total of four times, and will face tough competition this year from Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop music The Code has been seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday.\n\nThe rehearsals have already shown Golan back bending in a white dress before emerging in a circle flanked by dancers as well as being bathed with yellow light as the song reaches its crescendo.\n\nThere were shouts at the rehearsals on Wednesday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nNetherlands act Joost Klein, with the irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with folkish Ulveham are also seen as likely to progress to the final.\n\nFrance's Slimane with the soulful Mon Amour will also perform on Thursday, alongside Italy's Angelina Mango with La Noia and Spain's Nebulossa with Zorra, but is already through to the final as one of the big EBU donators alongside the UK with Olly Alexander and Germany with Isaak.\n\nThe 2024 hosts of Eurovision are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin Akerman.\n\nBBC One and BBC iPlayer begin the broadcast of the second semi-final from 8pm on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians",

canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag have been set off in Malm\u00f6's central square during a demonstration in Sweden against Israel's participation in tonight's second Eurovision Song Contest semi-final.\n\nProtesters are carrying signs displaying images of Gaza civilians who have been injured amid the Hamas-Israel conflict.\n\nA heavy police presence arrived at Malm\u00f6's main square earlier ahead of the protests.\n\nOfficers in more than five vans arrived in Stortorget ahead of Eden Golan, representing Israel, taking to the stage in Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nThe Swedish Police Authority positioned themselves at various entrance points to the square as tourists walked around taking pictures of the fountain and the town hall.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place in the afternoon, which a spokesman for the force said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThe organisers of the march say the demonstration will take place at 3pm, with it ending at Molleplatsen park.\n\nOfficers from Sweden, along with Norway and Denmark, have been regularly patrolling Malm\u00f6 Arena, the city centre and the Eurovision village amid Israel facing calls to be excluded from the contest because of the war in Gaza.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's song 'Hurricane' was reworked from a previous track called 'October Rain', which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nThere have been continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, and the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malm\u00f6 and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nOrganisers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union, hit out in April against the \"unacceptable and totally unfair\" abuse of competitors amid \"the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt also told Irish finalist Bambie Thug to change their Ogham message, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nThere were shouts at the Israeli rehearsals yesterday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nThe programme is live on RT\u00c9 television from 8pm.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [],

All your questions answered", "body": "The 68 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, the biggest and longest-running music competition in the world, will take place this May - and it promises to be as brilliantly bonkers, and as politically fraught, as ever. The Brits will watch with caution after a bruising result for UK entry Mae Muller last year.\n\nCan Olly Alexander restore our national pride? Will there be a boycott of Israel? And when can you watch? Here are all your burning 2024 Eurovision questions answered.\n\nEurovision will take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. The stadium is Sweden's second-largest indoor arena.\n\nThe 15,500 capacity building has previously held the contest back in 2013. The wider host city of Malm\u00f6 will also be running side events across the area in conjunction with the live shows.\n\nThe fun kicked off on May 7 with the first of two semi-finals. The second is on May 9, followed by the grand final on May 11.\n\nAll of the shows are broadcast live. We'll see 37 countries competing in 2024 - including Luxembourg, which last appeared in the contest back in 1993.\n\nIn the first semi-final, 15 countries competed for a place in the final. Ukraine, Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Finland, Croatia, Ireland and Luxembourg all made it through; Poland, Iceland, Moldova, Azerbaijan and Australia were eliminated.\n\nIn the second semi-final, the remaining 16 will fight for a final place: Albania, Armenia, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Switzerland, Belgium, Estonia, Georgia, Israel, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, and San Marino.\n\nThe so-called \"Big Five\" countries and host nation Sweden go through to the final automatically, but, for the first time this year, they will also perform in the semi-finals. Germany, Sweden and the UK perform in the first semi, and France, Italy and Spain in the second.\n\nWhile availability is limited, some tickets for the semi-finals, final and evening previews are still up for sale on Ticketmaster, with prices starting at 860 Swedish Krona.\n\nThis is equivalent to about \u00a363, ranging to 14890,00 Krona for VIP Packages, equivalent to about \u00a31,100.\n\nAfter Loreen triumphed in Liverpool with her song Tattoo, the 2024 edition of Eurovision comes from Sweden. Hollywood actress Malin \u00c5kerman joins comedian and Eurovision regular Petra Mede to host the semi-finals and final from Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nOh yes - this is the Scandi nation's seventh time as hosts, which is frankly showing off. They previously hosted the contest from Stockholm in 1975, 2000 and 2016, from Gothenburg in 1985, and from this year's choice Malm\u00f6 in 1992 and 2013.\n\nThat clutch of seven wins makes Sweden the most successful Eurovision nation ever - tied with Ireland. The UK isn't far behind, with five wins (although none, alas, in recent years).\n\nThere's a definite buzz ahead of Eurovision, although also some concern given the current political sensitivities (of which more below). Malm\u00f6 is organising a full programme of events to keep visitors, estimated at 100,000, entertained, from drag shows and club nights to yet more musical performances.\n\nFortuitously, Sweden can also celebrate the 50 anniversary of Abba's Eurovision win (in Liverpool, in 1974) with their 2024 contest. There's even a rumour that Abba themselves might make a rare appearance to say thank you for the music.\n\nAll of the finals will be broadcast live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer: the remaining semi-final on May 9, and the grand final on May 11.\n\nYears & Years lead singer Olly Alexander is Flying the flag for the UK this year.\n\nHe's a legitimate artist and a great performer. Alas, though, says the Telegraph's music critic Neil McCormick, his song Dizzy is just OK - an electro-dance-pop track somewhat in the vein of last year's winner Tattoo, but unlikely to be memorable in a competition where you have to go big (and then even bigger). This entry, Neil fears, is too formulaic to stand out.\n\nThis is the real talking point of the 2024 contest, despite organisers' frantic efforts to avoid political controversy at all costs.\n\nYou may remember that Russia was banned by Eurovision from participating in its 2022 contest following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Organisers the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) said the inclusion of Russia would \"bring the competition into disrepute\".\n\nBut what about Israel? Should the same rule apply? That's become a fiercely contested argument, not helped by Israel originally entering a provocative song. Several nations have seen protests and petitions about Israel's inclusion, and the Icelandic broadcaster R\u00daV seriously debated its participation in 2024 if Israel was involved, before ultimately deciding to stay in.\n\nA pro-Palestinian protestor invaded the stage during the first semi-final of Norway's Melodi Grand Prix (the country's Eurovision selection event), and audience members held up signs about the targeting of Palestinian children during Sweden's Melodifestivalen.\n\nProtest posters are already appearing in Malm\u00f6, and the Malm\u00f6 Live digital sign was spray-painted with \"Free Gaza\" in March. The Malm\u00f6 police have received requests for large-scale protests near the arena, both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel.\n\nMultiple Eurovision entrants, including the UK's Olly Alexander, signed a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages.\n\nEBU director general Noel Curran has said that Eurovision is taking the same stance as other major bodies like sports federations in keeping an inclusive stance towards Israel, and stated that Eurovision is \"a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\"\n\nSo, Israel first submitted a song called October Rain, written by Avi Ohayon, Keren Peles and Stav Beger, and sung by 20-year-old Eden Golan. \"October\" recalls the horrific Hamas massacre, and the song's lyrics were initially pretty pointed too. \"I'm still wet from the October rain\"; \"There's so air left to breathe\"; \"They were all good children, each one of them\".\n\nA panicked EBU asked Israel to submit another song - and were met with fury. Culture minister Miki Zohar said on X (formerly Twitter) that the \"moving\" song expresses \"the feelings of the people and the country these days, and is not political.\" He added that it would be \"scandalous\" to disqualify it.\n\nHowever, a compromise was reached: the song was rewritten and became the less problematic Hurricane, now Israel's official entry. But critics claim that the music video clearly references the October music festival massacre via its dancers in a field, and that Golan wearing a top with a large hole in it suggests a bullet wound.\n\nIt's not ideal, to put it mildly, for a contest whose slogan is \"united by music\". Expect a charged atmosphere any time the Israeli entry is on stage.\n\nYes. Following the announcement of their Eurovision ban in 2022, Russia's state broadcasters suspended their membership of the EBU, preventing them from taking part in future competitions too.\n\nAlmost certainly, given the above. Malm\u00f6's police area manager Petra Stenkulla told local radio that Sweden currently has a terror threat level of four out of five, adding: \"We can never guarantee safety but we will do our utmost to make people feel safe.\"\n\nThe EBU has recently put out a statement condemning abuse directed at participating artists over Israel's involvement in the contest. It acknowledges \"the depth of feeling\" that comes from a Eurovision \"set against the backdrop of a terrible war\", and supports freedom of speech, but opposes \"any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.\"\n\nThe statement finishes with a plea for constructive dialogue and support for the artists appearing \"on what is a music and entertainment show\", hoping to \"share their music with the world.\"\n\nPolitics aside (whew), Eurovision is best known for its reliably madcap performances. Think banana-loving wolves, filthy milkmaids, and that guy in the giant hamster wheel. Or last year's joyful eyesore of an entry from Finland. There's no such thing as too weird.\n\nThe 2024 Irish entry, non-binary artist Bambie Thug's \"electro-metal breakdown\" Doomsday Blue, certainly has a lot going on. The lyrics contain spells - including killing curse Avada Kedavra, which you might recognise from Harry Potter - and the music video morphs between an angry witch and a dream world featuring the colours of the transgender flag.\n\nSpain's entry has already caused a row. Its foxy song title Zorra means \"vixen\", but is more usually misogynistic slang for \"bitch\" or \"slut\". Husband-and-wife singers Nebulossa say they're reclaiming it, and Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez waded in to defend the track from feminist criticism. The performance features male backing dancers in corsets and thongs, so perhaps it's equal-opportunities objectification.\n\nI have high hopes of deranged melodrama from Belgium's Mustii, whose music video sees him semi-naked, oiled up and using at least 20 fog machines. Croatia's excellently named Baby Lasagna gives us a shouty number about economic emigration, and this year's stress migraine comes courtesy of Estonia's hip-hop-folk-mash-up We (sure) know nothing about (these) drugs.\n\nBut can anyone top No Rules! by Finland's Teemu Keisteri aka Windows95man for sheer twaddle? While sporting that (pixelated, per Eurovision rules) Microsoft Windows logo in his performance, he hatched from a denim egg and haphazardly sprayed fire from his jean shorts. Finland's jury vote placed him dead last, but the public vote put him through.\n\nIt's complicated. Until recently, voting comprised a mixture of tallies from the juries of individual countries with an element of public voting. However there was a big shake-up to the voting system last year after irregular voting patterns were discovered among the juries of six countries during a 2022 semi-final. Essentially Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino were all suspected of voting for each other.\n\nSo last year, for the first time, juries from individual countries were banned from deciding which nations progress from the semis to the Grand Final. Instead it's now determined solely by a public vote, and viewers from countries not taking part (so-called Rest of World countries) are able to vote for their favourite songs (paying \u20ac0.99 per vote for the privilege).\n\nHowever, the six countries with a bye to the final are only allowed to vote in one semi each. It's randomly allotted, and in 2024 British viewers can vote in the first semi-final only.\n\nBut that's just the semis. The rankings in the all-important Grand Final are decided by a combination of the points from countries' individual juries (\"douze points from Sarajevo\" etc.) and votes from viewers. Each person can vote up to 20 times but cannot select their own country's entry.\n\nUntil recently, votes in the final have been weighted 50-50 between juries and the public vote. But as of last year, votes from the Rest of World countries are combined to have the equivalent weight of one participating country. That alters the 50-50 ratio to give the general public a 50.6 per cent say in the winner, versus a 49.4 per cent say for the juries.\n\nKnotty, isn't it? And you thought it was just a cheesy singing competition.\n\nGeopolitics does still inevitably stray into the contest in the form of block voting. Watch out for the Slavic vote, the Nordic vote and the Francophone vote. Not forgetting Greece and Cyprus, which always award each other the maximum 12 points. Expect ironic cheers when they invariably do so.\n\nTheir 2024 entry isn't exactly a dead cert. Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil's warbly dance track is apparently inspired by Mother Teresa and the Virgin Mary, and features a pretty cringe solemn rap section. But voters may still want to show some love for Ukraine via Eurovision.\n\nYes, all lead vocals must be live. This includes any over-dubs by the singer that follow the song's melody. Performers can choose between pre-recorded backing vocals, live backing singers (either on or off stage) or a combination of live and recorded backing vocals. Songs must be original compositions and no longer than three minutes long. No more than six performers are allowed on stage during any one song.\n\nPre-recorded backing tracks were first allowed in 1973 so long as all the instruments that were pre-recorded were also seen being \"performed\" - or mimed - on stage. This rule was made redundant by the dawn of electronic music and scrapped in 1997, the year after Gina G's band had to cart massive computers onto the stage to perform Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit because those were the instruments on which the song was partially created.\n\nIt's an exercise in soft kitsch power, really. Although 160 million viewers around the world can't be bad for Europe's various tourist boards.\n\nThe host cities benefit too. Last year, around 100,000 extra people visited Liverpool, bringing in a net profit of \u00a354 million to the local economy.\n\nBoth countries were eliminated in the first semi-final, but the fact that they enter at all still baffles many. Australians have always loved Eurovision. Despite being 7,000-odd miles away from Europe, the country was invited to perform during the interval of the competition's semi-finals in 2014. The following year Australia was given a one-off chance to compete in the actual finals due to it being Eurovision's 50th anniversary. Singer Guy Sebastian came fifth and so impressed the Eurovision hierarchy that Australia was allowed to return annually as a full-time competitor. If Australia wins the contest then it doesn't mean that participants would jet off to Sydney for the following year's bash. A special rule means that a victorious Australia would have to pick a European co-host to lay on the competition on its behalf.\n\nAnd Azerbaijan? Well, the \"Euro\" in Eurovision isn't really geographical. Rather it stems from the fact that the contest is organised by the EBU, which comprises broadcasters from counties in Europe and beyond. According to the EBU's website, it has 112 member organisations from 56 countries with an additional 30 associate members in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Full-time members also include broadcasters from Jordan and Tunisia.\n\nAmericans have historically viewed Eurovision as a quaint and eccentric curio. Things started to change in 2016 when some 50 million US households were able to watch it for the first time thanks to a deal between the EBU and Viacom.\n\nThen in 2020 the contest got the Will Ferrell treatment in the comedy film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga in which it was, largely, portrayed as a quaint and eccentric curio (although the film did receive an Oscar nomination for best original song).\n\nIn 2022, broadcaster NBC launched its own US-only version. The American Song Contest pitted 56 performers against each other: one from each of the US's 50 states, one from the capital Washington DC, plus one from each of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, US Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Oklahoma won. The contest was not repeated in 2023. Still, at least Americans can vote in the actual Eurovision now - through the official app or by visiting here.\n\nIt can be. Abba (1974), Celine Dion (1988) and Olivia Newton-John (1974) went on to become global superstars after Eurovision. The contest has also helped sustain the careers of artists who've already made it, such as Michael Ball (1992), Cliff Richard (1968) and Lulu (1969). And it has given boosts to performers in the later stages of their careers (Katrina and the Waves, Engelbert Humperdinck and Bonnie Tyler).\n\nM\u00e5neskin, the Italian winners from 2021, are now huge mainstream stars: they played London's O2 and Glastonbury last year. Sam Ryder, the UK's 2022 runner-up, has done pretty well for himself too. But for every artist who makes it, dozens don't.

The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013.\n\nSweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000 and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985.\n\nThe concert venue is the Malmo Arena, which has a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nWHAT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE EXPECTED?\n\nSeveral protests are planned in central Malmo this week after organizer European Broadcasting Union (EBU) resisted calls to exclude Israel over its devastating military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nProtests against Israel's participation which are expected to draw tens of thousands of people are scheduled for 1300 GMT on Thursday and Saturday. Pro-Israel supporters have planned a protest for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nA vessel from Swedish NGO 'Ship to Gaza' is scheduled to arrive in Malmo harbour on Wednesday, with a call for solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nWHO IS ISRAEL'S EUROVISION CONTESTANT?\n\nEden Golan, 20, will represent Israel at this year's Eurovision with the song \"Hurricane\".\n\nIsrael was allowed to compete after agreeing to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught in Israel.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nIsrael has previously won Eurovision four times, in 1978, 1979, 1998 and 2018.\n\nWHAT SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN?\n\nSwedish police said security will be higher than in 2013 when Malmo last hosted the Eurovision. It has been reinforced by officers from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nAuthorities have said the threat level for terrorist or cyber attacks is high.\n\nVisitors will have to pass through metal detectors before entering Malmo arena, and will not be allowed to bring bags into the venue.\n\nOnly the national flags of the participating countries and the Pride flag are allowed inside the venue, while flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners likely to be to used promote other causes during the TV broadcast will be removed.\n\nHOW DOES VOTING WORK?\n\nThe results of the two semi-finals are decided by viewers, who can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or the Eurovision app.\n\nViewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 were eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nThose in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nIn the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act.\n\nEach country will award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country.\n\nNew to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior to each semi-final and the Grand Final.\n\nWHO SECURED A SPOT IN THE GRAND FINAL FOLLOWING THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL?\n\nCroatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nAustralia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, and Poland did not make it through to the final.\n\nWHO WILL COMPETE IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL ON THURSDAY?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nWHO COMPETES IN THE GRAND FINAL?\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final.\n\nLast year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries make the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nSince 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nHOW TO WATCH IT\n\nThe song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nWHO IS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN EUROVISION?\n\nBookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland, Italy, Ukraine and Ireland as the top five favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify also suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands or host nation Sweden.\n\nWHO ARE THE PRESENTERS?\n\nThe song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin Akerman.\n\nEUROVISION HISTORY\n\nThe Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia.\n\nOriginally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television, with only seven countries competing - the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets.\n\nWHICH COUNTRIES HAVE WON THE MOST EUROVISIONS?\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019.\n\nWHO WON LAST YEAR?\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.\n\n(Reporting by Isabelle Yr Carlsson, Louise Breusch Rasmussen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; editing by Sharon Singleton,

She is performing in the second semi-finals tonight with the bookies expecting her to qualify for the grand finals.\n\nLyrics in October Rain included: 'There's no air left to breathe / No place, no me from day to day.'\n\nThe song, which was mostly sung in English and was said to end with the last three lines in Hebrew, evoking the Hamas conflict, ends with: 'They were all good children each one of them.'\n\nIt had also been reported that Golan would have sung the word 'flowers' which, when understood in context, is said to refer to fallen IDF soldiers in battle, in her line: 'Who told you boys don't cry/ Hours and hours/ And flowers/ Life is not a game for the cowards.'\n\nThe entry had come under fire after these lyrics prompted accusations that they were 'spreading propaganda' and contained a political message with reference to the Hamas attacks.\n\nThe changes to October Rain were made after a request from the country's president, Isaac Herzog.\n\n'The president emphasized that at this time in particular, when those who hate us seek to push aside and boycott the state of Israel from every stage, Israel must sound its voice with pride and its head high and raise its flag in every world forum, especially this year,' Kan said, according to Reuters.\n\nIsrael's inclusion in the Eurovision Song Contest has sparked widespread backlash due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, with some even boycotting the annual event.\n\nThere have also been continued demonstrations in Sweden qnd the week of Eurovision has already seen small gatherings in Malmo and at the Eurovision village when Austrian 2014 winner Conchita Wurst was on stage.\n\nToday a heavy police presence descended on Malmo's main square ahead of a pro-Palestinian march, which a spokesperson for the force would cause 'disturbance to traffic.'\n\nEden, who was born in Israel and raised in Russia, was selected to perform after winning a TV talent show, on which she performed Aerosmith's I Don't Want To Miss A Thing.\n\nShe follows in the footsteps of last year's entry Noa Kirel, who finished the 2023 Song Contest in third place.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest previously told Metro.co.uk that it 'it is a competition for broadcasters - not governments - and the Israeli public broadcaster has participated in the Contest for 50 years.'\n\nThey added that Israeli public broadcaster Kan 'meets all the competition rules and can participate'.\n\n'We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war. A lot of the images from Israel and Gaza that audiences are watching every day are provided through the EBU News Exchange, which we run with our members,' it continued.\n\n'However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n'We are aware of the many voices calling to exclude Israel from this year's competition in the same way as we excluded the Russian broadcaster in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n'Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make. In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\n\n'The relationship between Kan and the Israeli Government is fundamentally different to the relationship that exists between those Russian Members and the State, with the Israeli Government in recent years threatening to close down the broadcaster.\n\n'The EBU is aligned with other international organizations, including sports unions and federations and other international bodies, that have similarly maintained their inclusive stance towards Israeli participants in major competitions at this time.\n\n'We remain committed to ensuring the Eurovision Song Contest remains a non-political event that continues to unite audiences worldwide through music.'\n\nThe next Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Finals will air on Thursday, May 9, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer. The Grand Final airs on Saturday, May 11, at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIsrael's Eurovision 2024 delegate Eden Golan will perform in the second semi-final of this year's song contest amid ongoing protests in Malmo, Sweden.\n\nThe 20-year-old singer is due to take to the stage this evening (Thursday 9 May), where she will perform \"Hurricane\", a track reworked from her country's original entry \"October Rain\".\n\nIsrael was asked by the contest's organisers the Eurovision Broadcasting Union (EBU) to change their song after \"October Rain\" was widely interpreted as a reference to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.\n\nGolan will compete against fellow delegates including Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba.\n\nThe EBU has resisted calls to ban Israel from competing amid the war in the Gaza Strip, where the Palestinian death toll is believed to have reached 34,000 people.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march is taking place today as part of continued demonstrations in Sweden over Israel's participation, which Swedish police said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nGolan told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nThere were reportedly shouts and boos during her rehearsal on Wednesday 8 May, including cries of \"free Palestine\".\n\nMeanwhile, the EBU doubled down on its stance over Israel this week, saying that to exclude Israeli broadcaster Kan from the competition would have been a \"political decision\".\n\nSpeaking on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) which organises Eurovision, said it based its decision to include Kan on the competition rules in place.\n\n\"I fully agree it is a family event and the great thing about this music competition is that it's all about values,\" he said. \"It's about uniting onstage all of these young talents, these participants, and they do great. It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nDiscussing the backlash, De Tender said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\"\n\nThe EBU announced ahead of the competition that they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestine symbols at the show.\n\nIt also said people are not allowed to wave banners with slogans relating to the war - ticketholders are only allowed to bring and display only flags representing the 37 participating countries in the arena.\n\nDespite this, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIrish delegate Bambie Thug also revealed that they were asked to change their body paint ahead of their performance at the first semi-final, which included wording in a medieval dialect that translated to \"peace\" and \"ceasefire\".\n\nThe EBU maintained that this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nIsrael has won the Eurovision Song contest a total of four times, most recently with Netta and her song \"Toy\" in 2018.\n\nHowever, Golan has tough competition from Switzerland's Nemo, who is widely considered one of the favourites to win at the grand final this Saturday, along with the Netherlands' Joost and Norway's Gate.\n\nThe second Eurovision semi-final will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 8pm tonight (Thursday 9 May).", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators protested in the Swedish port city Thursday against Israel's participation in the pan-continental pop competition. Protesters waving green, white and red Palestinian flags packed the historic Stortorget square near Malmo's 16th-century town hall before a planned march through the city for a rally in a park several miles from the Eurovision venue.\n\nChanting chanting and yelling slogans such as \"Israel is a terror state,\" the demonstrators set off smoke flares in the Palestinian colors during a noisy but peaceful rally to criticize Israel and call for a cease-fire in its war with Hamas.\n\nThe first of those slogans chanted by the protesters is a highly controversial reference to the creation of a Palestinian state, defined by the Anti-Defamation League as an \"antisemitic slogan commonly featured in anti-Israel campaigns and chanted at demonstrations.\"\n\nWhile many protesters reject the slogan being rooted in racism or calling for violence, the ADL says \"it is fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the State of Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state... It is an antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland.\"\n\nThere was a large police presence at the protest in Malmo on Thursday, with a helicopter hovering overhead and officers on rooftops with binoculars.\n\n\"It's important to be here,\" said Amani Eli-Ali, a Malmo resident of Palestinian heritage. \"It's not okay for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nOutrage over the ongoing Israel-Hamas brought a jarring juxtaposition to Eurovision week in Malmo. Music fans in colorful sequined outfits or draped in their national flags mixed in the streets with supporters of the Palestinian cause in traditional keffiyeh scarves.\n\nPalestinian flags fly from windows and balconies along a pedestrianized thoroughfare that has been temporarily renamed \"Eurovision street.\"\n\nPro-Palestinian groups plan to march again on Saturday, the day of the Eurovision final.\n\nIsrael's government warned its citizens of a \"tangible concern\" that Israelis could be targeted for attack in Malmo during the contest.\n\nOrganizers, who say they try to keep Eurovision a non-political event, with this year's them being unity through music, have rejected calls to bar Israel over the conduct of its war against Hamas.\n\nThey did tell Israel to change the lyrics of its entry, however, which was originally titled \"October Rain,\" in an apparent reference to Hamas' cross-border Oct. 7 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and triggered the war. The song was renamed \"Hurricane,\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nShe was to compete in a semi-final Thursday evening. Some audience members attending a Wednesday dress rehearsal could be heard to boo during Golan's performance.\n\nCritics of the decision to let Israel compete point out that Russia was kicked out of Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus was ejected a year earlier over its government's crackdown on dissent.\n\n\"We're supposed to be united by music but we're not united, because Israel is participating,\" said Malmo resident Anders Trolle-Schultz, who attended the protest.\n\n\"I think Malmo should have kept Eurovision, but we should have told Israel either 'Stay away,' or maybe even say, why don't we invite a Palestinian music group to participate? That would be fair.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slogan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_State_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the State of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/09/1a392d3a-67ef-43f9-8eeb-74370fc3ee78/thumbnail/1200x630/b1fb5dc1e4ca441941124041974c9e7d/eurovision-israel-protest-2151598209.jpg?v=218688c1357f974b9630d4fa8914721c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2786, "textEnd": 2792}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Choose to see the side who sees you. Who shares the same values as you.'\n\nGali Atari, who was part of group Milk and Honey when Israel won in 1979, believes Golan would have a chance of winning if it was any other year.\n\n'And all the noise in the background makes it much more difficult,' she told The Jerusalem Post.\n\n'All this year, with the boos, the violent protests - it's all very frightening, but Eden handles it very well.'\n\nYet the tensions at this year's event are palpable.\n\nHeavily-armed police officers carrying machine guns are patrolling outside hotels, and drone-mounted cameras will monitor the crowds as they bid to keep the peace during the world's biggest pop competition.\n\nMost alarming of all, there are reports that terrorists are planning to bomb the arena.\n\nGolan shared a New York Times article on her Instagram page in which she defiantly says she 'won't let anything break me'\n\nFootage showed members of the crowd booing and shouting during Golan's performance on Wednesday night\n\nGolan pictured performing her song Hurricane during rehearsal at the Malmo Arena on Wednesday\n\nWithout question, Golan is Eurovision's most controversial entry this year and is said to be under constant bodyguard watch having faced death threats.\n\nIf there were any questions remaining about what kind of reception she will receive, those were resoundingly answered last night.\n\nAs she took to the stage dressed in a stone-coloured maxi dress that resembled bandages, boos filled the arena.\n\nRead More Moment Israeli singer Eden Golan's Eurovision performance is nearly drowned out by boos and chants of 'Free Palestine' in chaotic scenes\n\nGolan was nearly drowned out by the demonstrators chanting 'Free Palestine' while she performed 'Hurricane' during the Eurovision Song Contest's Jury Show.\n\nYet despite the threats on her life and fears of a terror attack, she has refused to be cowed and has remained steadfast in her response.\n\n'I won't let anything break me,' the Russian-Israeli defiantly says.\n\nBefore she flew out for this year's competition the young singer showed a composure that belied her years.\n\n'I wouldn't say I'm worried. I'm prepared,' she insisted to MailOnline, after some deliberation.\n\nBut her entry has been mired in controversy from the start. Denmark, Finland, Norway and even host country Sweden have repeatedly called for Israel to be banned from the contest altogether. And in Belgium, two Ministers demanded that the Jewish state be treated the same as Russia, which has been barred since 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThat Eden's song has fallen foul of Eurovision rules stating that all entries must be strictly non-political, hasn't helped to ease the tension.\n\nSwedish protesters hold a placard calling for a boycott of Israel at a demonstration outside Malmo's City Hall against the country's participation in the Eurovision song contest\n\nA demonstrator displays a poster during a protest against Israel's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, ahead of the second semi-final, in Malmo, Sweden\n\nProtesters pull down a Eurovision flag during the 'Stop Israel' demonstration between Stortorget and Molleplatsen in Malmo\n\nThe original iteration of her piano-backed ballad Hurricane was called October Rain and was a barely disguised tribute to the victims of the Hamas terrorist attack last year. It included lyrics such as 'There's no air left to breathe' and 'They were all good children, each one of them'.\n\nRead More Israel's Eurovision contestant Eden Golan 'is told not to leave her room except for when she performs for her own safety' - as singer, 20, expresses her support for Israeli civilians held hostage by Hamas\n\n'I was going through a roller-coaster of emotions,' Golan says. 'The song itself has a powerful story.\n\n'When you're going through a lot within yourself and life in general...'\n\nWhile her family was not directly affected by the October 7 massacre, she has many friends who lost loved ones.\n\nOne friend's boyfriend was murdered at the Nova music festival, an event she finds too painful to discuss.\n\n'We can't disconnect from what's going on in our country,' she continues. 'The entire country is not going through an easy time. I feel like the horror of October 7 brought Jews closer, made us all united.'\n\nBut the original October Rain song was rejected by the contest's organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, on political grounds.\n\nAfter several revisions, October Rain was renamed as Hurricane and now tells the story of a woman emerging from a personal crisis.\n\nMusically, it's the same song but the lyrics are more generic, the references to the massacre replaced with phrases like 'every day, I'm losing my mind' and 'I'm still broken from this hurricane'.\n\nThe original iteration of Golan's piano-backed ballad Hurricane was called October Rain and was a barely disguised tribute to the victims of the Hamas terrorist attack last year\n\nGolan has become a lightning rod for hate since the invasion of Gaza in response to the Hamas atrocities of Ocober 7\n\nGolan has endured a barrage of death threats as Israel's entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nGolan is hoping the positive response to her music will outweigh any negativity.\n\n'People of all nationalities like the song,' she says confidently. 'They can disconnect from what they believe and just focus on the music.'\n\nBoth her parents hail from the former Soviet Union and while she was born in Kfar Saba, central Israel, they decided to move to Moscow when she was six.\n\nHer father Eddie, 56, is a businessman, while her mother, Olga, 50, is her manager - or 'momager'.\n\nWhile living in Moscow, she was educated at a British international school, where she got A-levels in maths, psychology and business.\n\nThe singer - who arrived in the city last week sporting a yellow pin, symbolising support for the release of hostages held by Hamas - insists that she is safe in Malmo despite the threats against her.\n\n'I'm getting a lot of love and support from my family and from the professional team that has become like a family.'\n\nShe added: 'Protests are of course not pleasant,but I can't wait to be there on stage and try to make people feel something in the three minutes that I have. I'm very focused in my mission.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She is not only an exceptional performer, but a symbol of strength and resilience. We \u2764\ufe0f you Eden and our entire country is cheering you on.\"\n\nLast month, the European Broadcasting Union, which organizes the competition, released a statement condemning harassment and attacks against Golan on social media.\n\nThe popular European show drew in an audience of 216 million people last year, according to the European Broadcasting Union, almost twice as many as this year's Super Bowl.\n\nThe EBU reportedly refused Israel's entry to the competition twice, saying the lyrics to songs it had chosen were too political, according to Euronews.\n\nA submission from Golan called \"October Rain\" was objected to by the EBU because the title and some of the songs were overtly political, according to The New York Times. She edited the lyrics and renamed the song, \"Hurricane.\"\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, the EBU defended the decision to allow Israel to participate, despite the ongoing conflict.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments,\" EBU Director General Noel Curran said in a Jan. 31 statement.\n\n\"As a member-led organization, our governing bodies -- the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board -- did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years,\" Curran said.\n\nFacing backlash over the move in light of Russia being excluded in 2022 after the invasion of Ukraine, Curran said the relationship between Israeli broadcaster KAN and the Israeli government is \"fundamentally different to the relationship that exists between those Russian Members and the State.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the many voices calling to exclude Israel from this year's competition in the same way as we excluded the Russian broadcaster in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine,\" Curran said. \"Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make. In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\"\n\nIsrael launched an incursion into the Gaza Strip following an unprecedented terrorist attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed about 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government. Israel's military operation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nSixteen countries will compete in Thursday's semifinals, including Israel, with 10 moving on to the finals on Saturday. The winners are determined by a jury of music professionals and a public vote.\n\nIsrael has won the competition -- which started in 1956 -- four times, most recently in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronews", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euronews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/857e2c1c-0cc6-4afb-9310-8048dbb1e5da/eden-golan-mo_1715266942504_hpMain_2_16x9t.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-31", "textStart": 2222, "textEnd": 2229}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3508, "textEnd": 3514}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

I think it's just wrong.\"\n\nMore than 10,000 people gathered on Thursday afternoon in Malmo's main square before marching through the city's central pedestrian shopping street, according to police estimates.\n\nAlongside signs that read: \"Liberate Palestine\", banners that said \"EUR legitimises genocide\" and \"colonialism cannot be washed in pink\" could be seen in the crowd.\n\nAbout 50 protesters made it to the front of the Malmo Arena, where the event is taking place, before being dispersed by a heavy police presence. Protesters also entered the Eurovision Village, where spectators can follow the concert on large screens.\n\nIn a different neighbourhood, about 100 counter-protesters gathered under police protection to express their support for Israel.\n\nThe war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas' unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took about 250 hostages. Israel estimates 128 of them remain in Gaza, including 36 who officials say are dead.\n\nIsrael in response vowed to crush Hamas and launched a military offensive that has killed at least 34,904 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\n- 'Nothing to celebrate' -\n\nIn 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?\" said protester Marwo Mustafa.\n\n\"The people are here for Eurovision trying to celebrate. There's nothing to celebrate. It's an ongoing war,\" added 29-year-old Mustafa Mustafa.\n\nIsrael's entry, \"Hurricane\" by singer Eden Golan, will compete in Thursday's semi-final. It has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday wished Golan good luck and said she had \"already won\" by enduring the protests that he called a \"horrible wave of anti-Semitism\".\n\nSince the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition.\n\nAt the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.\n\nProtester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: \"At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it.\"", "source":

Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000 and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985. The concert venue is the Malmo Arena, which has a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nWHAT DEMONSTRATIONS ARE EXPECTED? Several protests are planned in central Malmo this week after organizer European Broadcasting Union (EBU) resisted calls to exclude Israel over its devastating military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nProtests against Israel's participation which are expected to draw tens of thousands of people are scheduled for 1300 GMT on Thursday and Saturday. Pro-Israel supporters have planned a protest for Thursday at 1600 GMT. A vessel from Swedish NGO 'Ship to Gaza' is scheduled to arrive in Malmo harbour on Wednesday, with a call for solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nWHO IS ISRAEL'S EUROVISION CONTESTANT? Eden Golan, 20, will represent Israel at this year's Eurovision with the song \"Hurricane\".\n\nIsrael was allowed to compete after agreeing to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught in Israel. Golan says she hopes her performance will help unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\" Israel has previously won Eurovision four times, in 1978, 1979, 1998 and 2018.\n\nWHAT SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN? Swedish police said security will be higher than in 2013 when Malmo last hosted the Eurovision. It has been reinforced by officers from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nAuthorities have said the threat level for terrorist or cyber attacks is high. Visitors will have to pass through metal detectors before entering Malmo arena, and will not be allowed to bring bags into the venue.\n\nOnly the national flags of the participating countries and the Pride flag are allowed inside the venue, while flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners likely to be to used promote other causes during the TV broadcast will be removed. HOW DOES VOTING WORK?\n\nThe results of the two semi-finals are decided by viewers, who can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or the Eurovision app. Viewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 were eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nThose in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain. In the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act. Each country will award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country. New to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior to each semi-final and the Grand Final.\n\nWHO SECURED A SPOT IN THE GRAND FINAL FOLLOWING THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL? Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nAustralia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, and Poland did not make it through to the final. WHO WILL COMPETE IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL ON THURSDAY?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands. WHO COMPETES IN THE GRAND FINAL?\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final. Last year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThere will be 26 acts in total in the final. WHY THE 'BIG FIVE'?\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries make the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Since 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nHOW TO WATCH IT The song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nWHO IS THE FAVOURITE TO WIN EUROVISION? Bookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland, Italy, Ukraine and Ireland as the top five favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify also suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands or host nation Sweden.\n\nWHO ARE THE PRESENTERS? The song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin Akerman.\n\nEUROVISION HISTORY The Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia. Originally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television, with only seven countries competing - the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets. WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE WON THE MOST EUROVISIONS?\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019. WHO WON LAST YEAR?\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

There was a large police presence, with a hovering helicopter, and officers on rooftops with binoculars.\n\n\"It's important to be here,\" said Amani Eli-Ali, a Malmo resident of Palestinian heritage. \"It's not OK for Sweden to arrange this Eurovision and have Israel in the contest.\"\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which has killed almost 35,000 Palestinians, has brought a jarring juxtaposition to Eurovision week in Malmo.

The song was renamed \"Hurricane\" and Israeli singer Eden Golan was allowed to remain in the contest.\n\nShe will compete in Thursday's semi-final.

So never let it be said, that Eurovision is not political, because no matter what the politics are, it all comes down to \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3.'\n\n@ElisFeno blasted: 'Also remember: Moroccan Oil is the sponsor of Eurovision! If you wonder why EBU is so keen on keeping Israel in the competition, you must remember EBU values money more than human lives.'\n\n'wait so if eurovision got rid of moroccan oil as a sponsor , it's more likely that \u0456srael would be banned yeah?' @loveruusuvuori also wrote.\n\nThe comments come after Jean Philip De Tender, Deputy Director General of the EBU, said: 'The European Broadcasting Union acknowledges the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision Song Contest - set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East - has provoked.\n\n'We understand that people will want to engage in debate and express their deeply held views on this matter. We have all been affected by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those in Israel and in Gaza.\n\n'However, we wish to address the concerns and discussions surrounding this situation, especially the targeted social media campaigns against some of our participating artists.\n\n'The decision to include any broadcaster, including the Israeli' broadcaster Kan, in the Eurovision Song Contest is the sole responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies and not that of the individual artists. These artists come to Eurovision to share their music, culture, and the universal message of unity through the language of music.'\n\nThe statement stressed the EBU's previous explanations for the inclusion of Israeli broadcaster Kan, saying: 'Constructive debate is a positive consequence of such decisions.\n\n'However, while we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest. This is unacceptable and totally unfair, given the artists have no role in this decision.'\n\nThe statement ended: 'The EBU is dedicated to providing a safe and supportive environment for all participants, staff, and fans of the Eurovision Song Contest. We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to promote the values of respect, inclusivity, and understanding, both online and offline.\n\n'We urge everyone to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue and support the artists who are working tirelessly - on what is a music and entertainment show - to share their music with the world.'\n\nHowever, fans have claimed the statement has backfired and is 'making things worse', and have continued to call on the EBU to ban Israel from the competition.\n\nAnd they're not the only ones to boycott. G\u00edsli Marteinn Baldursson is a presenter for Iceland's channel R\u00daV, and has fronted Eurovision commentary for the country's broadcasts from 1995 to 2003, and then from 2016 to 2023.\n\nHowever, he's dropped out from this year's competition, boycotting the 2024 event over Israel's inclusion.\n\nBaldursson, 52, announced his plans to boycott on Instagram, saying [in translation]: 'To answer those who have asked: I will not cover Eurovision this year.\n\n'The reason is Israel's actions in Gaza and the competition's response to it, mainly the lack thereof.\n\n'For me, Eurovision is about atmosphere and joy, and I feel neither in this year's competition.'\n\nBaldursson, who has also hosted his own talk shows, held a short career in politics, as a city representative for the Independence Party in the Reykjavik City Council between 2006 and 2013, after which he returned to television.\n\nHe now fronts a Sunday Morning talk show and a Friday news programme, holding the roles of chief editor and host for both.\n\nIceland will be represented in the upcoming 68th Song Contest by Hera Bjork, with the song Scared of Heights.\n\nEurovision has sparked immense backlash over recent months over including Israel in the Song Contest, with more than 2,000 artists from Iceland, Finland, and the host country Sweden signing open letters asking for Israel to be banned.\n\nProtests in some of those countries have called for Israel to be suspended from the Song Contest after retaliation attacks in Gaza, following Israel's retaliation in Gaza after the Israel-Hamas conflict began on October 7.\n\nDame Helen Mirren, Boy George and Sharon Osbourne are among stars who have signed an open letter supporting the country's inclusion, after it was shared on non-profit body Creative Community For Peace, who campaign against cultural boycotts of Israel.\n\nThere was further controversy over Israel's entry Eden singing October Rain, which contained lyrics that described the situation around the Hamas attack which killed around 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage.\n\nIsrael's public broadcaster Kan later agreed to change the lyrics to the song, and said they had reached out to the songwriters to 'readjust the texts, with full artistic freedom' before being sent to the Eurovision Broadcasting Union for approval.\n\nTheir entry had come under fire after lyrics in the song prompted accusations that they are 'spreading propaganda' and that they contain a political message with reference to the Hamas attacks, with Golan having previously dedicated the track to the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, saying: 'We won't truly be OK until everyone returns home.'\n\nLyrics in October Rain originally included: 'There's no air left to breathe / No place, no me from day to day.'\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's entry Olly Alexander has responded after being called on to boycott.\n\nThe Years & Years frontman, 33, will represent the UK at the competition in Sweden in May with his song Dizzy.\n\nHowever last year the BBC was urged to drop him as the act after he reportedly endorsed a statement accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza in an open letter condemning the country as having an 'apartheid regime' that 'acts to ethnically cleanse the land.'\n\nAfter calls to boycott, he addressed the controversy in a letter of his own alongside other entrants from Ireland, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland, Denmark, Lithuania and Finland.\n\nThe statement read: 'We want to begin by acknowledging the privilege of taking part in Eurovision.\n\n'In light of the current situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and particularly in Gaza, and in Israel, we do not feel comfortable being silent. It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages.\n\n'We stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and islamophobia.'\n\nIt continued: 'We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.\n\n'We feel it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.'\n\nA spokesperson for Eurovision told Metro.co.uk: 'The full list of participating broadcasters in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest was approved by the governing bodies of the European Broadcasting Union and has no connection with, or impact on, any pre-existing partnerships. We do not publicly share commercially sensitive information regarding the sponsors of the event.'\n\nMetro.co.uk has approached Eurovision and Moroccan Oil for comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity

Blood is on your hands too!\" rung out around downtown Malmo.\n\nWhile the sound of police helicopters circling overhead couldn't drown them out, officers on the ground managed to intervene and stop some of the protesters in their tracks.\n\nThere was a significant police presence in the square as Swedish authorities heighten security ahead of possible unrest.\n\nMalmo had already been taken over by approximately 100,000 visitors for the annual kitsch-fest before 5,000 protesters made themselves known.\n\nSecurity fears ahead of the remainder of Eurovision have only increased as a result, with the final taking place on Saturday.\n\nMetal barricades and large concrete blocks have been put up around Malmo Arena, the host venue, where visitors must pass through metal detectors before entering.\n\nBags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses, with organisers concerned political demonstrations could take place in the crowd.\n\nGolan is expected to perform her song Hurricane in tonight's semi final, a piece reworked from an early track October Rain - thought to be a reference to the attack by Hamas.\n\nDuring her rehearsals on Wednesday, however, she was booed and there were reported shouts of \"free Palestine\".\n\nGolan vowed that \"nothing will deter\" her after the performance was interrupted by protesters, vowing that she was \"proud to represent my country\".\n\nOthers in the large crowd did applaud her, though, and the young singer hopes her performance will help to unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she said earlier this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nIsrael's involvement in the competition has been met with fierce criticism due to the country's ongoing war against Hamas inside the Gaza Strip.\n\nHowever, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, has dismissed calls for Israel to be excluded.\n\nThe competition bills itself as a non-political event and can disqualify countries who break that neutrality rules.\n\nThursday's semi-final is due to begin at 7pm (GMT) and will feature

I think it's just wrong.\"\n\nMore than 10,000 people gathered on Thursday afternoon in Malmo's main square before marching through the city's central pedestrian shopping street, according to police estimates.\n\nAlongside signs that read: \"Liberate Palestine\", banners that said \"EUR legitimises genocide\" and \"colonialism cannot be washed in pink\" could be seen in the crowd.\n\nAbout 50 protesters made it to the front of the Malmo Arena, where the event is taking place, before being dispersed by a heavy police presence. Protesters also entered the Eurovision Village, where spectators can follow the concert on large screens.\n\nIn a different neighbourhood, about 100 counter-protesters gathered under police protection to express their support for Israel.\n\nThe war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas' unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nMilitants also took about 250 hostages. Israel estimates 128 of them remain in Gaza, including 36 who officials say are dead.\n\nIsrael in response vowed to crush Hamas and launched a military offensive that has killed at least 34,904 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?\" said protester Marwo Mustafa.\n\n\"The people are here for Eurovision trying to celebrate. There's nothing to celebrate. It's an ongoing war,\" added 29-year-old Mustafa Mustafa.\n\nIsrael's entry, \"Hurricane\" by singer Eden Golan, will compete in Thursday's semi-final. It has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday wished Golan good luck and said she had \"already won\" by enduring the protests that he called a \"horrible wave of anti-Semitism\".\n\nAt the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.\n\nProtester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: \"At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greta Thunberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Turkish_offensive_into_north-eastern_Syria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4525299/war-gaza-looming-over-this-years-eurovision.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1425, "textEnd": 1434}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are also expected in the city for demonstrations urging a cease-fire in the Gaza war and criticizing Israel's participation in the contest.\n\nHere's a guide to what Eurovision means, how it works and what to watch for:\n\nWHAT IS EUROVISION?\n\nThe short answer: Eurovision is a music competition, in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music.\n\nThe longer answer is that Eurovision is an extravaganza that melds pop, partying and politics -- a cross between a music festival, an awards show and a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. It's an event full of silly fun, a celebration of music's unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nThirty-seven countries are entered in the contest, which this year is taking place over several days in the Swedish port city of Malmo. The country is hosting after Swedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, England.\n\nThrough two semifinals, 37 acts are narrowed to the 26 who will compete in Saturday's final in front of thousands of spectators in the Malmo Arena and a global television audience estimated at 180 million.\n\nNations can enter a solo act or a band. They can perform in any genre and language, but the rules state they must sing live and songs must be no more than three minutes long. Staging has grown ever more elaborate, incorporating flashy pyrotechnics and elaborate choreography. This year is particularly strong on topless male dancers.\n\nOnce all the acts have performed, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build. Ending up with \"nul points,\" or zero, ranks as a national humiliation.\n\nThe musical style of Eurovision has diversified dramatically since the contest was founded in 1956. The early years of crooners and ballads gave way to perky pop - epitomized by perhaps the greatest Eurovision song of all time, ABBA's \"Waterloo,\" which won the contest 50 years ago.\n\nNowadays, Euro-techno and power ballads remain popular, but viewers have also shown a taste for rock, folk-rap and eccentric, unclassifiable songs.\n\nWHO ARE THE FAVORITES?\n\nAccording to bookmakers, a leading contender is Swiss singer Nemo, who is performing a melodic, operatic song titled \"The Code.\" Nemo would be the first performer who identifies as nonbinary to win the contest, which has a huge LGBTQ+ following. The contest had its first transgender winner, Dana International, a quarter century ago.\n\nAnother nonbinary performer generating huge buzz is Ireland's Bambie Thug, whose song \"Doomsday Blue\" is Gothic, intense, over the top and a real crowd-pleaser. They're the only contestant known to have brought a \"scream coach\" to Malmo. Ireland has won Eurovision seven times - a total equaled only by Sweden - but has fared poorly in recent years.\n\nOther acts tipped to do well include operatic Slovenian singer Raiven, Ukrainian rap-pop duo Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil and Spain's Nebulosa, whose song \"Zorra\" caused a stir because its title can be translated as an anti-female slur.\n\nSo far, the act with the most momentum is Croatian singer Baby Lasagna. His song \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is quintessential Eurovision: exuberant, silly, a little emotional and incredibly catchy. It's already a huge fan favorite.\n\nWHY ARE SOME PEOPLE PROTESTING?\n\nEurovision's motto is \"united by music,\" and its organizer, the European Broadcasting Union, strives to keep politics out of the contest. But it often intrudes.\n\nBelarus was expelled from Eurovision in 2021 over its government's clampdown on dissent, and Russia was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis year, there have been calls for Israel to be excluded because of its conduct in its war against Hamas.\n\nIsrael is competing, but was told to change the title of its song, originally called \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border attack. It's now called \"Hurricane\" and will be performed by 20-year-old singer Eden Golan at Thursday's semifinal.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups are planning large protests on Thursday and Saturday, and Swedish police are mounting a major security operation, with officers from across the country bolstered by reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nPalestinian flags hang from some apartment balconies in Malmo but have been banned from the televised event, along with all flags apart from those of competing nations. At the first semifinal's opening act, one performer managed to sneak in a political statement, singing with a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf tied around his wrist.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, said it regretted Swedish singer Eric Saade's decision to \"compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Meet Malta Eurovision 2024 entry", "body": "They had a pretty lengthy hiatus from the contest between 1975 and 1991, but for the first couple of decades after they returned, they've been a lot more successful.\n\nIn fact, they hold the peculiar record of being the only non-winning country to get four top-three results: third place in 1992 and 1998, and second place in 2002 and 2005.\n\nSince then, the country has struggled to grasp Eurovision glory, but that could all change this year with Malta's 2024 entry.\n\nBut who exactly is Sarah Bonnici, and where might you know her from? Here's everything that you need to know.\n\nSarah Bonnici will be representing Malta at the 68th Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nArguably, no one knows Eurovision better than Sarah Bonnici. She has been mentored from a young age by 1996 Eurovision contestant Miriam Christine, and made her debut in the national selection of 2009's Malta Junior Eurovision Song Contest, where she finished in third place.\n\nThe following year, she was a back-up dancer for the Maltese entry for the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAnd now, she's graduated to the big leagues. She's also participated in the first season of X Factor Malta and has appeared in numerous music festivals across Europe.\n\n\"I don't know if there is a way how to prepare for it,\" Bonnici told Eurovoix. \"You know, I need to work hard to make sure I give the people the best possible opening to the Eurovision.\n\nRead More:\n\n\"It's a great responsibility, obviously, but I'm very honoured to be given that responsibility, I must say.\"\n\nMalta's Eurovision 2024 song is called Loop. Sarah wrote it with Linnea and Joy Deb, who previously wrote the winning song for Eurovision 2015.\n\nOther writers involved with the song include Leire Gotxi Angel, Sebastian Pritchard-James, Kevin Lee and Michael Joe Cini.\n\nMalta did not qualify for the Eurovision final last year. Performed by The Busker, Dance (Our Own Party) came 15th in the first semi-final.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.

Among those in the crowd was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nThe march took place at the same time as Israel's entrant - 20-year-old Eden Golan - was taking part in the final dress rehearsal for the second Eurovision semi-finals, in the Malmo arena.\n\nDuring the march - which included families with young children, and people with dogs and bicycles - smoke canisters in the colours of the Palestinian flag were set off, with some protesters carrying signs displaying images of Gaza civilians who have been injured amid the Hamas-Israel conflict.\n\nThere was also a banner done in the style of Eurovision with the word \"genocide\" on it - an accusation vigorously denied by Israel amid the war with Hamas.\n\nSecurity in Malmo is high, and extra police have been drafted in from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nDuring an earlier rehearsal on Tuesday, Golan was met with boos and cries of \"Free Palestine,\" and an audience member appeared to have a Palestinian flag removed from them in the auditorium.\n\nThe EBU has said only flags that represent countries taking part, and the rainbow flag, can be brought to the event.\n\nThey have said they will remove any other \"flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners being used for the likely purpose of instrumentalising the TV shows\".\n\nThe 20-year-old singer performed her song Hurricane while flanked by five backing dancers and centred around a large wheel-like prop in the centre of the stage.\n\nEarlier lyric changes\n\nThe song has been tweaked three times, after an initial version titled October Rain was ruled too political by the EBU who believed some lyrics referred to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nSome still believe that some lyrics in the current song - including \"Dancin' in the storm... I'm still broken from this hurricane,\" still refer to attacks which killed over 1,000 people and resulted in hundreds of hostages being taken.\n\nIn the run-up to the competition - which is the world's largest live music event - there have been calls for Israel to be banned over their ongoing ground offensive in Gaza.\n\nHowever, the EBU - which says it is an apolitical organisation - has ruled that Israel can take part as they say it has not broken any broadcasting rules.\n\nThe EBU has also condemned harassment and abuse of artists competing in the show and said they form no part of the decision-making process. As it stands no performer has withdrawn from the contest.\n\nMore than 34,000 people have been killed, and over 77,000 have been injured in Gaza since the conflict began, according to Gaza's Hamas-led health ministry.\n\nThe second-semi finals\n\nThe run-through came ahead of the second semi-final this evening, which will choose the final 10 acts to go into the Grand Final.\n\nOther acts taking part in the semi-final tonight include Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, - all of whom called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe UK's act, Olly Alexander, and Ireland's Bambie Thug were also part of the joint statement. Both performed in the first semi-final on Tuesday and will be performing in the final.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been performing since she was nine years old, left Israel when she was six to live in Russia with her family, but returned when she was 18.\n\nShe told ITV News she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\" earlier this week.\n\nThe Grand Final will see 26 countries battle it out on Saturday night.", "source":

Bags are being checked and visitors are only allowed to bring in small purses.\n\n\"I am a Eurovision fan and it breaks my heart but I'm boycotting. I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong,\" 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).\n\nIsrael's military offensive in Gaza has killed at least 34,904 people, mostly women and children, according to local health officials.\n\nThe war in Gaza came after Palestinian resistance group Hamas's surprise cross-border attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, according to an Israeli figures.\n\nIn 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?\" 29-year-old Margo Mustafa said.\n\n\"The people are here for Eurovision trying to celebrate. There's nothing to celebrate. It's an ongoing war,\" she added.\n\nMore than 5,000 people gathered on Thursday afternoon in Malmo's main square, according to a police estimate.\n\nAlongside signs that read: \"Liberate Palestine,\" banners that said \"EUR legitimises genocide\" and \"colonialism cannot be washed in pink\" could be read in the crowd.\n\nProtester Kasia Wiatrowska, from Malmo, wore a green T-shirt with the words \"Libre Palestine\" on the back.\n\n\"I do like Eurovision,\" Wiatrowska told Reuters. \"We all love music. But this year music is dividing people, and I don't like that,\" she added.\n\nIsrael's entry, \"Hurricane\" by singer Eden Golan, will compete in Thursday's semi-final. It has already been partially rewritten and given a new title after Eurovision organizers deemed the original version to be too political.\n\nAnother protester, Palestinian Amar, who only gave one name, said: \"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world.\"\n\n\"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews,\" he added.\n\n\"At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it,\" protester Cecilia Brudell told AFP.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition.\n\nAt

Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters are also expected in the city for demonstrations urging a cease-fire in the Gaza war and criticizing Israel's participation in the contest.\n\nHere's a guide to what Eurovision means, how it works and what to watch for:\n\nWHAT IS EUROVISION?\n\nThe short answer: Eurovision is a music competition, in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music.\n\nThe longer answer is that Eurovision is an extravaganza that melds pop, partying and politics -- a cross between a music festival, an awards show and a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. It's an event full of silly fun, a celebration of music's unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nThirty-seven countries are entered in the contest, which this year is taking place over several days in the Swedish port city of Malmo. The country is hosting after Swedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, England.\n\nThrough two semifinals, 37 acts are narrowed to the 26 who will compete in Saturday's final in front of thousands of spectators in the Malmo Arena and a global television audience estimated at 180 million.\n\nNations can enter a solo act or a band. They can perform in any genre and language, but the rules state they must sing live and songs must be no more than three minutes long. Staging has grown ever more elaborate, incorporating flashy pyrotechnics and elaborate choreography. This year is particularly strong on topless male dancers.\n\nOnce all the acts have performed, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build. Ending up with \"nul points,\" or zero, ranks as a national humiliation.\n\nThe musical style of Eurovision has diversified dramatically since the contest was founded in 1956. The early years of crooners and ballads gave way to perky pop - epitomized by perhaps the greatest Eurovision song of all time, ABBA's \"Waterloo,\" which won the contest 50 years ago.\n\nNowadays, Euro-techno and power ballads remain popular, but viewers have also shown a taste for rock, folk-rap and eccentric, unclassifiable songs.\n\nWHO ARE THE FAVORITES?\n\nAccording to bookmakers, a leading contender is Swiss singer Nemo, who is performing a melodic, operatic song titled \"The Code.\" Nemo would be the first performer who identifies as nonbinary to win the contest, which has a huge LGBTQ+ following. The contest had its first transgender winner, Dana International, a quarter century ago.\n\nAnother nonbinary performer generating huge buzz is Ireland's Bambie Thug, whose song \"Doomsday Blue\" is Gothic, intense, over the top and a real crowd-pleaser. They're the only contestant known to have brought a \"scream coach\" to Malmo. Ireland has won Eurovision seven times - a total equaled only by Sweden - but has fared poorly in recent years.\n\nOther acts tipped to do well include operatic Slovenian singer Raiven, Ukrainian rap-pop duo Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil and Spain's Nebulosa, whose song \"Zorra\" caused a stir because its title can be translated as an anti-female slur.\n\nSo far, the act with the most momentum is Croatian singer Baby Lasagna. His song \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is quintessential Eurovision: exuberant, silly, a little emotional and incredibly catchy. It's already a huge fan favorite.\n\nWHY ARE SOME PEOPLE PROTESTING?\n\nEurovision's motto is \"united by music,\" and its organizer, the European Broadcasting Union, strives to keep politics out of the contest. But it often intrudes.\n\nBelarus was expelled from Eurovision in 2021 over its government's clampdown on dissent, and Russia was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis year, there have been calls for Israel to be excluded because of its conduct in its war against Hamas.\n\nIsrael is competing, but was told to change the title of its song, originally called \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border attack. It's now called \"Hurricane\" and will be performed by 20-year-old singer Eden Golan at Thursday's semifinal.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups are planning large protests on Thursday and Saturday, and Swedish police are mounting a major security operation, with officers from across the country bolstered by reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nPalestinian flags hang from some apartment balconies in Malmo but have been banned from the televised event, along with all flags apart from those of competing nations. At the first semifinal's opening act, one performer managed to sneak in a political statement, singing with a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf tied around his wrist.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, said it regretted Swedish singer Eric Saade's decision to \"compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType":

Eden Golan, the 20-year-old singer representing Israel with her song \"Hurricane,\" drew both cheers and boos during a dress rehearsal on Wednesday in advance of the second semifinal on Thursday. Bookmakers have ranked Israel in the top 10 likely victors, which would land Golan among 26 contestants in the final on Saturday.\n\nLocals in Malm\u00f6, which has a longstanding reputation for antisemitism and a record of attacks on Jews by both neo-Nazis and members of the substantial Muslim immigrant minority, unsuccessfully petitioned the city to bar Israel from competing. (The last time the city hosted the contest, in 2013, Jews and non-Jews held a rally after Israeli fans reported harassment.)\n\nNow, Malm\u00f6 is brimming with Swedish police, along with reinforcements from Denmark and Norway, ahead of demonstrations against Israel's participation, including a boat march that took place on Wednesday. Police expect over 20,000 protesters in the small city's streets, outnumbering about 15,000 people holding tickets to gather in the Malm\u00f6 Arena. Outside of Malm\u00f6, Eurovision is expected to draw more than 150 million people to TV screens worldwide.\n\nIsrael's inclusion in the contest sparked international backlash because of its deadly military campaign in Gaza. Over 160,000 people have signed a petition to ban Israel from Eurovision, while 20 artists dropped out from performing in events surrounding the contest. Some protest groups have organized alternative events in Malm\u00f6, such as \"FalastinVision,\" billed as a \"genocide-free song contest\" hosting 15 artists from eight countries -- including the Palestinian territories -- at a live show scheduled for the same time as Eurovision's final.\n\nAmong the artists performing at FalastinVision is Bashar Murad, a Palestinian singer who competed to represent Iceland in Eurovision this year and lost to Hera Bj\u00f6rk.\n\n\"Palestine is blocked from major events around the world -- including Eurovision -- so it's difficult for Palestinian artists to showcase our culture and art globally,\" Murad said in a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \"FalastinVision is a beautiful way to address that.\"\n\nBoycotters have accused Eurovision of a double standard for including Israel after excluding Russia from its contest in 2022, one day after Russian troops invaded Ukraine. Noel Curran, head of the EBU, has maintained that Russia was cut off for failing to meet broadcaster guidelines that Israel has met.\n\n\"Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and, as a non-political media organization, not ours to make,\" Curran said in a statement. \"In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\"\n\nAs part of Eurovision's \"non-political\" guidelines, the contest bars flags and signs other than the national flags of participants and the rainbow pride flag -- which means that Palestinian flags are not allowed in the venue.\n\nOn Tuesday, opening act performer Eric Saade -- a former Swedish contestant of Palestinian origin -- wore a keffiyeh on his wrist, a scarf seen as symbolizing Palestinian solidarity. Saade was reprimanded by the EBU, which said in a statement, \"We regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"\n\nThe EBU also cited politicization concerns as its reason for rejecting Golan's initial song entry, titled \"October Rain.\" The song appeared to reference Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people, took more than 250 hostage and triggered Israel's military assault in Gaza. Golan tweaked the song and renamed it \"Hurricane,\" although its lyrics could still be interpreted as a reaction to Oct. 7.\n\nFor many Israelis, the country's participation and success in the contest is a point of pride and an antidote to concerns -- heightened this year amid the war -- that Israel is isolated on the world stage. Israel was accepted into the contest in 1957, its second year, causing Egypt and Syria to exit. It competed for the first time in 1973 and has since won four times, most recently for \"Toy\" by Netta in 2018.\n\nGolan is largely staying out of view during Eurovision week for fear of security threats, skipping most events other than the live shows and rehearsals. In lieu of the contest's opening \"turquoise carpet\" event on Sunday, she went to a local ceremony marking Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nFredrik Sieradzki, who heads the Jewish Learning Center in Malm\u00f6, said he welcomed Golan together with the Israeli delegation. Malm\u00f6 is home to a small Jewish community of about 1,000 people, including some parents who have complained of antisemitic incidents at their children's schools since Oct. 7, according to Sieradzki.\n\n\"Eden Golan lit one of the candles. We lit six candles and the seventh one, of course, for the latest victims,\" Sieradzki told JTA, referring to the people killed on Oct. 7. \"It was a very emotional get-together, we felt we were family. When Jews come here, we welcome them.\"\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Golan avoided criticizing the protests against her performance.\n\n\"It's up to the people what to do,\" she said. \"They have the right to speak their voice, but I'm focusing on my part which is giving the best performance, and on the good, on the good vibes, the good people.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType":

But though the annual party often carries an undertone of geopolitics -- and has included Israel for half a century -- the involvement of an Israeli contestant this year has sparked a fierce backlash amid the country's offensive in Gaza.\n\nThe Eurovision Village, which will serve the 100,000 fans expected to descend on Sweden's third-largest city of Malm\u00f6 for the event, features heavily armed police and pro-Palestinian protests alongside the typically loud music.\n\nAway from the streets, the tensions have also coloured the competition. Ireland's contestant, nonbinary \"goth gremlin\" Bambie Thug, was the latest artist to evoke the war ahead of Israel's participation in the second semi-final on Thursday.\n\nThe Irish musician, who has already qualified for the final, said on Instagram they had been asked to remove pro-Palestinian body paint from their costume. The writing in a medieval script had included the words \"Free Palestine\" and \"ceasefire\".\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union, which runs the event, has said it will bar flags and symbols apart from those of participating countries and the LGBT+ community.\n\nBambie Thug said on Thursday: \"My heart and prayers are with the people of Palestine\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I am anti-war, anti-occupation, anti-oppression and anti-killing of innocent civilians and children!!\"\n\nHundreds of artists in each of the five Nordic countries including Sweden signed separate petitions earlier this year urging Eurovision to ban Israel from the competition, while many of the 26 artists performing in Malm\u00f6 have faced social media abuse for taking part alongside the Israeli act.\n\nBritain's Eurovision artist Olly Alexander was among those who signed a letter in response to calls for a boycott, arguing instead for the \"unifying power of music\".\n\nIsrael's government itself has raised the alarm: the National Security Council urged Israelis not to travel to Malm\u00f6, calling it \"an anti-Israel protest hub\". Israeli media reported that the Shin Bet security service advised Eden Golan, its Eurovision contestant, not to leave her hotel room for anything other than her performances.\n\nShe has already changed the words of the song \"Hurricane\", initially called \"October Rain\", after it was seen to refer to the devastating October 7 attacks by Hamas last year that killed 1,200 people and sparked the war in Gaza. Almost 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory offensive.\n\nVideos posted on social media showed Golan being booed by some audience members at a Wednesday dress rehearsal, prompting her to say she was \"proud to represent my country, particularly this year\".\n\nEarlier in the contest, Swedish singer Eric Saade was reprimanded by organisers after he wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf around his wrist during a performance.\n\nJean Philip De Tender, deputy director-general of the EBU, said the organiser acknowledged \"the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision Song Contest -- set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East -- has provoked\".\n\nBut De Tender said online abuse and harassment of artists was \"unacceptable and totally unfair, given the artists have no role\" in deciding which broadcasters take part.\n\nThe EBU represents Europe's broadcasters, including Israeli's Kan, a member since 1957 that has taken part in the song contest since 1973.\n\nEurovision is the latest cultural event to face controversy over the inclusion of Israel, with similar calls for a boycott at the Venice Biennale late last year and clashes over other film and artistic events in Europe.\n\nThe singing competition, which is broadcast to more than 200mn people worldwide, maintains it is \"non-political\" but is no stranger to being used for political motives. Pacts between groups of similarly minded or geographically close nations often ensure that their acts progress, while rivals are handed \"nul points\".\n\nRussia, a former participant, was banned a day after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Ukraine won the contest the following year, an outcome seen as an outpouring of support for the war-torn nation rather than the quality of its musical offering. Another political flashpoint was the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 2009, Georgia tried to submit a song \"We Don't Wanna Put In\", widely interpreted as a criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Organisers rejected the song.\n\nAfter Israel was included in the 1970s, Arabic broadcasters refused to show Israeli artists and threatened not to show the contest at all in years when it was hosted by the Jewish state. Israel has won several times, including with transgender singer Dana International in 1998.\n\nLocal dynamics have compounded the pressure this year. Home to one of Sweden's largest immigrant populations, many of them Muslims, Malm\u00f6 has suffered from a reputation for antisemitic incidents. That culminated in videos of cars driving around the city celebrating Hamas's attack on Israel in October, as well as protesters burning an Israeli flag next to Malm\u00f6's synagogue in November.\n\nTensions have risen further since Swedish police allowed a couple -- one of them wrapped in an Israeli flag -- to burn a Koran at the weekend. Sweden's successful bid to join Nato was delayed for more than a year over multiple incidents involving Koran burning by anti-Islam activists.\n\nThe city of Malm\u00f6 apologised this week after cleaning away pro-Palestinian graffiti ahead of the competition, saying it was \"an unfortunate mistake\".\n\nThe contest's organisers have also sought to defuse the situation. EBU boss Noel Curran said it was a \"competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\"\n\nCurran said the EBU had been aware \"of the many voices calling to exclude Israel in the same way as we excluded the Russian broadcaster in 2022\".\n\nBut he added: \"Comparisons between wars and conflicts are complex and difficult and\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009not ours to make. In the case of Russia, the Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values.\"",

The singer said: 'She's a powerful songstress who isn't afraid to break barriers in pursuit of her dreams.'\n\nEden added that she also draws inspiration for her music from Beyonc\u00e9, Ariana Grande, Jessie J, RAYE, Whitney Houston, and Justin Timberlake.\n\nIsrael's Eurovision song for 2024 is called Hurricane.\n\nIt is a rewritten version of October Rain, which sparked controversy because of lyrics including 'There's no air left to breathe,' and 'They were all good children, each one of them,' which were seen as references to the victims of the Hamas attack.\n\nThe song also made reference to 'flowers', which according to the Israel Hayom newspaper is a military code for war fatalities.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs Eurovision, describes the contest as a non-political event, and can disqualify contestants who have breached that rule.\n\nAs a result, Israel's public broadcaster, Kan, agreed to amend the lyrics for their entry, at the request of the country's president Isaac Herzog.\n\nThe piano ballad now tells the story of a young woman experiencing a personal crisis, and is among the favourites with bookmakers to win the competition.\n\nThe team behind Israel's entry includes Stav Beger, who co-wrote and produced Toy - the song that led Israel to victory in 2018.\n\n'But on the other hand, I even more so want to represent the country this year, because of its meaning - it has a totally different significance.\n\n'And we can bring everything we're feeling, and everything the country is going through, in those three minutes. To speak through the song to the world.'\n\nWith the news that Eurovision host country Sweden is bracing for anti-Israel protests around the event, it has also been reported by celebrity website Walla Celebs that Eden Golan has faced death threats.\n\nIn a statement, the EBU said: 'While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.'\n\nFollowing the Jury Show, Israeli public broadcaster Kan said that it has issued a complaint to the EBU and to SVT, Sweden's public broadcaster, about the booing at the show as well as political incidents during the first semi-final on Tuesday night.\n\nThe broadcaster also said in a statement: 'Eden stood on the stage during the dress rehearsal with pride and gave an incredible performance. They did not silence her and they will not silence us. See you tomorrow.'\n\nMost bookmakers put Israel as the eighth favourite to win Eurovision 2024, giving Eden Golan odds of around 2%.\n\nEden will have to get through the semi-final first, however. But with Eurovision World placing her as fifth most-likely to qualify, her chances of getting to perform on Saturday night are looking good.\n\nCurrently, Croatia is the favourite to win Eurovision, followed by Switzerland's Nemo as well as Ukraine, Ireland, Italy, France and the Netherlands, which are all favoured over Israel's entry.\n\nAfter Eden Golan was booed during the Jury Show, she released a statement saying she is 'proud to represent' her country.\n\nShe added: 'I am receiving support and love and I am determined to give my best performance tomorrow in the semifinal and nothing will deter me from that goal!'\n\nPreviously speaking to Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom, Eden explained that she is happy just to be taking part in the contest.\n\n'I really want to succeed and believe that we will advance to the Grand Final, but our mere participation is an achievement.'\n\nShe added: 'This year, it takes on a different and greater meaning, standing on that stage and showing that we are here. We went through a hurricane to get to this.'\n\nOn the controversies surrounding Israel's entry, Eden said, 'Some Eurovision fans probably don't like us, and that's something that really surprised me...After I found out, I didn't think 'Why me and why does it fall on me,' but what can be done and how to fix it and make this Eurovision happen. There's no point in dwelling on the 'why,' because that's how it happened, and that's what we have.'\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk

We hope that many people will come from Denmark to participate,\" Per-Olof Karlsson, one of the organizers, told the broadcaster.\n\nAsked why he felt it was important to stage such a protest, he said: \"Because Israel should be excluded from Eurovision just like they did with Russia.\"\n\nIn solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and as part of a protest, an alternative music event, called Falastinvision, will be held on the final day of the Eurovision Song Contest on May 11 in Malmo.\n\nMany artists from Sweden and other parts of Europe will participate to show their support for Palestinians.\n\nAuthorities have adopted extra security measures including police with submachine guns and reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nMalmo, Sweden's third largest city, is home to around 360,000 people spanning 186 nationalities, including a large Palestinian and Muslim population.\n\nLast week, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) decided to prevent contestants, performers, and fans from displaying Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols during the song contest.\n\nThe EBU said those who try to enter Malmo Arena with a Palestinian flag or a banner containing a political message will be stopped and the flags or banners will be taken away, according to the Goteborgs-Posten newspaper.\n\nIn 2022, Russia was barred from the Eurovision held in Turin, Italy, after neighboring Finland threatened to pull their performer out unless Moscow was banned due to the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe EBU prevented the country from participating in future competitions.\n\nIceland was fined by the EBU after its Eurovision act Hatari raised Palestinian flags during their appearance on the show held in Israel in 2019.\n\nIn December, the board of the Icelandic Society of Authors and Composers (FTT) publicly called on Iceland's public broadcaster RUV not to take part in the song contest \"unless Israel is denied participation in the competition on the same grounds as Russia in the last competition,\" FTT's General Director Stefan Eiriksson said in a letter sent to RUV.\n\n\"We all have a duty to take a stand against war and the killing of civilians and innocent children,\" Eiriksson said.\n\nHe further emphasized that individuals and states \"always have the choice not to put our name to such things.\"\n\n\"We owe it to those nations that act with force through military might not to share the stage in an event that is always characterized by joy and optimism,\" added Eiriksson.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news",

I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong,\" 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told AFP.The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.Israel in response vowed to crush Hamas and launched a military offensive that has killed at least 34,904 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.Militants also took about 250 hostages. Israel estimates 128 of them remain in Gaza, including 36 who officials say are dead.In 2022, Russia's state broadcaster was excluded from the European Broadcasting Union, which oversees Eurovision, in the wake of the war in Ukraine.\"I feel like if they can remove Russia why can they not do it to Israel?\" 29-year-old Margo Mustafa said.\"The people are here for Eurovision trying to celebrate. There's nothing to celebrate. It's an ongoing war\", she added.More than 5,000 people gathered on Thursday afternoon in Malmo's main square, according to an AFP estimate.Alongside signs that read: \"Liberate Palestine\", banners that said \"EUR legitimises genocide\" and \"colonialism cannot be washed in pink\" could be read in the crowd.Israel's entry, \"Hurricane\" by singer Eden Golan, will compete in Thursday's semi-final. It has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.&nbsp;Protester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: \"At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it\".Since the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition.At the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.cbw/cab/nmc/gv", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greta Thunberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Turkish_offensive_into_north-eastern_Syria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/wales_online_892/26c77fe09e3e383d7b39f6cc89d04c08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 693, "textEnd": 702}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

It's about diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"But there are competition rules and you need to follow the competition rules and take decisions based on these competition rules.\n\n\"If you were to exclude Kan (the Israeli broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nOrganisers have long banned most flags and signs from the contest - the only exceptions are participants' national flags and the pride flag, meaning Palestinian flags won't be allowed into the venue.\n\nIn April meanwhile, it issued a statement condemning \"abuse or harassment\" directed at participants.\n\n\"The EBU recognises the strong emotions stirred by this year's Eurovision Song Contest and the intense debate sparked by the inclusion of an Israeli entry,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We would like to stress that any decisions regarding participation are the responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies, not the individual artists.\n\nREAD MORE: Boycotting Eurovision is a small but necessary act\n\n\"We are firmly against any form of abuse or harassment directed at participants, online or offline, and are committed to fostering a sae, respectful and inclusive environment.\n\n\"We advocate for constructive dialogue and support for the artists, underlining the Contest's mission to be united by music.\"\n\nHowever, Irish Eurovision finalist Bambie Thug said they were forced to alter a pro-Palestine message calling for a ceasefire.\n\nAnd, Eric Saade, who opened Tuesday night's semi-final, wore a traditional headdress in support of Palestine during his performance.\n\nThe EBU said it \"regrets\" that Saade chose to wear the material and \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nOlly Alexander (below) has been selected as this year's representative for the UK.\n\nThe organisation Queers for Palestine circulated a letter, signed thousands, calling for the performer to pull out the show.\n\nHe has described some of the comments he and other participants have faced as \"very extreme\".\n\nAlexander said: \"A lot of the contestants and myself have been having a lot of comments that are like 'You are complicit in a genocide by taking part in Eurovision' which is quite extreme.

The city also hosted Eurovision in 1992 and in 2013.\n\nSweden has hosted Eurovision seven times in total, counting 2024. Stockholm, the capital, hosted the competition in 1975, 2000 and 2016 and Gothenburg in 1985.\n\nThe concert venue is the Malmo Arena, which has a capacity of up to 15,500.\n\nSeveral protests are planned in central Malmo this week after organizer European Broadcasting Union (EBU) resisted calls to exclude Israel over its devastating military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nProtests against Israel's participation which are expected to draw tens of thousands of people are scheduled for 1300 GMT on Thursday and Saturday. Pro-Israel supporters have planned a protest for Thursday at 1600 GMT.\n\nA vessel from Swedish NGO 'Ship to Gaza' is scheduled to arrive in Malmo harbour on Wednesday, with a call for solidarity with the people of Gaza.\n\nEden Golan, 20, will represent Israel at this year's Eurovision with the song \"Hurricane\".\n\nIsrael was allowed to compete after agreeing to modify the lyrics of its original song \"October Rain\", which appeared to reference the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught in Israel.\n\nGolan says she hopes her performance will help unite people.\n\n\"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nIsrael has previously won Eurovision four times, in 1978, 1979, 1998 and 2018.\n\nSwedish police said security will be higher than in 2013 when Malmo last hosted the Eurovision. It has been reinforced by officers from neighbouring Denmark and Norway.\n\nAuthorities have said the threat level for terrorist or cyber attacks is high.\n\nVisitors will have to pass through metal detectors before entering Malmo arena, and will not be allowed to bring bags into the venue.\n\nOnly the national flags of the participating countries and the Pride flag are allowed inside the venue, while flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners likely to be to used promote other causes during the TV broadcast will be removed.\n\nThe results of the two semi-finals are decided by viewers, who can vote up to 20 times, either by phone, text message or the Eurovision app.\n\nViewers in the 15 countries taking part in Semi-Final 1 were eligible to vote alongside three of the countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nThose in the 16 countries taking part in Semi-Final 2 are eligible to vote alongside three of the other countries pre-qualified for the Grand Final - France, Italy and Spain.\n\nIn the final, audience votes will make up half of the result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country will make up the other half.\n\nThe juries will rank the songs based on composition and originality of the song, quality of the stage performance, the artists' vocal capacity, and their overall impression of the act.\n\nNon-participating countries around the world will also be able to vote, and will collectively have the weight of one additional voting country.\n\nNew to this year's Eurovision, viewers outside the participating countries can vote 24 hours prior to each semi-final and the Grand Final.\n\nWHO SECURED A SPOT IN THE GRAND FINAL FOLLOWING THE FIRST SEMI-FINAL?\n\nCroatia, Cyprus, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia and Ukraine.\n\nAustralia, Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, and Poland did not make it through to the final.\n\nWHO WILL COMPETE IN THE SECOND SEMI-FINAL ON THURSDAY?\n\nMalta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe top 10 from each semi-final will participate in the final.\n\nLast year's winner and host nation Sweden has automatic entry to the final as well as the \"Big Five\" countries: United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.\n\nThe \"Big Five\" countries make the biggest financial contribution to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nSince 2000, these countries have secured themselves an automatic spot in the Grand Final.\n\nThe song contest will be broadcast by all 37 participating countries. It will also be streamed on YouTube.\n\nBookmakers have Croatia, Switzerland, Italy, Ukraine and Ireland as the top five favourites to win, while streaming data from Spotify also suggests a strong chance for the Netherlands or host nation Sweden.\n\nThe song contest will be presented by Swedish comedian and actress Petra Mede and Swedish-American actress Malin Akerman.\n\nThe Eurovision song contest is one of the world's largest television events, and has been held annually since 1956.\n\nEurovision features live music performances from most European countries and beyond, including Israel and Australia.\n\nOriginally it started as a technical experiment for transnational broadcast television, with only seven countries competing - the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and Italy.\n\nThe show reached 162 million people in 2023 through public service markets.\n\nSweden and Ireland are leading with seven wins each. France, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have each won five times, with the Netherlands as the most recent of the four countries to win in 2019.\n\nSwedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool for the second time with her song \"Tattoo\". She is the only person after Ireland's Johnny Logan to win the contest twice.\n\n(Reporting by Isabelle Yr Carlsson, Louise Breusch Rasmussen and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; editing by Sharon Singleton,

Thousands of anti-Israel protesters are also expected in the city for demonstrations urging a cease-fire in the Gaza war and criticizing Israel's participation in the contest.\n\nHere's a guide to what Eurovision means, how it works and what to watch for:\n\nUKRAINIAN DUO HEADS TO THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST WITH A MESSAGE: WE'RE STILL HERE\n\nThe short answer: Eurovision is a music competition, in which performers from countries across Europe, and a few beyond it, compete under their national flags with the aim of being crowned continental champion. Think of it as the Olympics of pop music.\n\nThe longer answer is that Eurovision is an extravaganza that melds pop, partying and politics -- a cross between a music festival, an awards show and a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. It's an event full of silly fun, a celebration of music's unifying power, but also a place where politics and regional rivalries play out.\n\nThirty-seven countries are entered in the contest, which this year is taking place over several days in the Swedish port city of Malmo. The country is hosting after Swedish singer Loreen won last year's competition in Liverpool, England.\n\nThrough two semifinals, 37 acts are narrowed to the 26 who will compete in Saturday's final in front of thousands of spectators in the Malmo Arena and a global television audience estimated at 180 million.\n\nNations can enter a solo act or a band. They can perform in any genre and language, but the rules state they must sing live and songs must be no more than three minutes long. Staging has grown ever more elaborate, incorporating flashy pyrotechnics and elaborate choreography. This year is particularly strong on topless male dancers.\n\nOnce all the acts have performed, the winner is chosen by a famously complex mix of phone and online voters from around the world and rankings by music-industry juries in each of the Eurovision countries. As the results are announced, countries slide up and down the rankings and tensions build. Ending up with \"nul points,\" or zero, ranks as a national humiliation.\n\nThe musical style of Eurovision has diversified dramatically since the contest was founded in 1956. The early years of crooners and ballads gave way to perky pop - epitomized by perhaps the greatest Eurovision song of all time, ABBA's \"Waterloo,\" which won the contest 50 years ago.\n\nNowadays, Euro-techno and power ballads remain popular, but viewers have also shown a taste for rock, folk-rap and eccentric, unclassifiable songs.\n\nAccording to bookmakers, a leading contender is Swiss singer Nemo, who is performing a melodic, operatic song titled \"The Code.\" Nemo would be the first performer who identifies as nonbinary to win the contest, which has a huge LGBTQ+ following. The contest had its first transgender winner, Dana International, a quarter century ago.\n\nAnother nonbinary performer generating huge buzz is Ireland's Bambie Thug, whose song \"Doomsday Blue\" is Gothic, intense, over the top and a real crowd-pleaser. They're the only contestant known to have brought a \"scream coach\" to Malmo. Ireland has won Eurovision seven times - a total equaled only by Sweden - but has fared poorly in recent years.\n\nOther acts tipped to do well include operatic Slovenian singer Raiven, Ukrainian rap-pop duo Alyona Alyona and Jerry Heil and Spain's Nebulosa, whose song \"Zorra\" caused a stir because its title can be translated as an anti-female slur.\n\nSo far, the act with the most momentum is Croatian singer Baby Lasagna. His song \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" is quintessential Eurovision: exuberant, silly, a little emotional and incredibly catchy. It's already a huge fan favorite.\n\nEurovision's motto is \"united by music,\" and its organizer, the European Broadcasting Union, strives to keep politics out of the contest. But it often intrudes.\n\nBelarus was expelled from Eurovision in 2021 over its government's clampdown on dissent, and Russia was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis year, there have been calls for Israel to be excluded because of its conduct in its war against Hamas.\n\nIsrael is competing, but was told to change the title of its song, originally called \"October Rain\" in apparent reference to Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border attack. It's now called \"Hurricane\" and will be performed by 20-year-old singer Eden Golan at Thursday's semifinal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnti-Israel groups are planning large protests on Thursday and Saturday, and Swedish police are mounting a major security operation, with officers from across the country bolstered by reinforcements from Denmark and Norway.\n\nPalestinian flags hang from some apartment balconies in Malmo but have been banned from the televised event, along with all flags apart from those of competing nations. At the first semifinal's opening act, one performer managed to sneak in a political statement, singing with a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf tied around his wrist.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union, which organizes Eurovision, said it regretted Swedish singer Eric Saade's decision to \"compromise the non-political nature of the event.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Norway.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Malmo, Sweden's third largest city, is home to around 360,000 people spanning 186 nationalities, including a large Palestinian and Muslim population.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8Last week, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) decided to prevent contestants, performers, and fans from displaying Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols during the song

Some 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for the annual kitsch-fest, under heavy police presence as authorities brace for possible unrest.\n\nSwiss rapper and singer Nemo was among those who qualified from the second semi-final on Thursday with the song 'The Code', as was Joost Klein of the Netherlands with his song 'Europapa'. Eurovision organisers had resisted calls to exclude Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, arguing that the competition is a non-political event.\n\nIsraeli solo artist Eden Golan, 20, and her song 'Hurricane' qualified on Thursday alongside nine others for Saturday's grand show, which will feature performances from 26 countries. Some booing was heard from the crowd before, during and after Golan's performance but also applause and Israeli flags waving, according to a Reuters journalist in the auditorium.\n\nMore than 10,000 pro-Palestinian campaigners, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, staged a non-violent protest in the hours ahead of the semi-final, waiving Palestinian flags and shouting \"boycott Israel\". A smaller group of pro-Israeli supporters, including members of Malmo's Jewish community, also staged a peaceful demonstration in the city, defending Golan and her nation's right to take part in the contest.\n\nHundreds of artists in Sweden and elsewhere had urged that Israel should be blocked from taking part, as did two Belgian government ministers earlier this year. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises the event, requested earlier this year that Israel tweak its initial lyrics in order to participate, saying they had originally made reference to the Oct. 7 onslaught.\n\nIn a video statement earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation. \"You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism - and representing the State of Israel with enormous honour,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nGolan has said she hopes her performance will help unite people. \"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she told Reuters in an interview this week. \"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Eden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greta Thunberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycotts_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycotts of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/11_03_2020_13_23_01_9613234.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553088", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 115, "textEnd": 121, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

I'm still broken from this hurricane,\" still refer to attacks which killed over 1,000 people and resulted in hundreds of hostages being taken.\n\nIn the run-up to the competition - which is the world's largest live music event - there have been calls for Israel to be banned over their ongoing ground offensive in Gaza.\n\nHowever, the EBU - which says it is an apolitical organisation - has ruled that Israel can take part as they say it has not broken any broadcasting rules.\n\nThe EBU has also condemned harassment and abuse of artists competing in the show and said they form no part of the decision-making process. As it stands no performer has withdrawn from the contest.\n\nMore than 34,000 people have been killed, and over 77,000 have been injured in Gaza since the conflict began, according to Gaza's Hamas-led health ministry.\n\nThe second-semi finals\n\nThe run-through came ahead of the second semi-final this evening, which will choose the final 10 acts to go into the Grand Final.\n\nOther acts taking part in the semi-final tonight include Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, - all of whom called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe UK's act, Olly Alexander, and Ireland's Bambie Thug were also part of the joint statement. Both performed in the first semi-final on Tuesday and will be performing in the final.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been performing since she was nine years old, left Israel when she was six to live in Russia with her family, but returned when she was 18.\n\nShe told ITV News she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\" earlier this week.\n\nThe Grand Final will see 26 countries battle it out on Saturday night.", "source":

It has already been partially re-written and given a new title after Eurovision organisers deemed the original version to be too political.\n\nProtester Cecilia Brudell told AFP: \"At six and nine, my children are now at an age where they want to watch Eurovision but this year we are completely boycotting it\".\n\nSince the beginning of the year, several petitions have demanded Israel's exclusion from the 68th edition of the annual music competition.\n\nAt the end of March, contestants from nine countries, including Swiss favourite Nemo, called for a lasting ceasefire.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2024/5/9/41_2024-638508870716692583-669.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

participation in the Eurovision song contest.\n\nIt comes as the city prepares to host the competition's second semi-final on Thursday night, in which Israel's entrant Eden Golan is performing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms Golan was booed during a rehearsal of her song Hurricane.\n\nA smaller demonstration in support of Israel has also taken place.\n\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg, was among those attending the pro-Palestinian protest.\n\nShe told the BBC that there was a \"moral obligation to act\" and to speak out against Israel's military operation in Gaza.\n\n\"If we are tens of thousands of people flooding the streets of Malmo when Eurovision is taking place, saying we will not accept this to continue, then it's a very strong signal - and it does make a difference,\" Ms Thunberg said.\n\nAnother protester, Matilda Varatta, told the Reuters news agency that she would like to see Israel disqualified as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not true that the Eurovision is not political, it has always been political, and it will always be,\" she said.\n\nEarlier, Ms Golan said that she was \"proud to represent my country\" and that \"nothing will deter\" her.\n\n\"I'm focused on music, on the good energy, and there are so many people supporting me, and I feel like I have such an honour to represent my country, especially in these times\".\n\nAt the pro-Israel demonstration, people could be heard singing Hurricane in support of Ms Golan amid a significant police presence.\n\n\"I'm not that interested in Eurovision,\" one demonstrator, Yael Sages Wahlstr\u00f6m, told Sweden's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.\n\n\"But since there has been such a huge storm of hate against Israel, I wanted to support\".\n\nThe Israeli Broadcasting Corporation, which organises the country's contest entry, says it has asked the European Broadcasting Union to prevent a repeat of Wednesday's booing incident.\n\nThe Swedish authorities say they have heightened security in place and are prepared for potential unrest.\n\nIsrael is currently engaged in a military campaign in Gaza, which they launched as a response to Hamas' cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.\n\nMore than 34,900 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name": "https", "type":

Meet Belgium Eurovision 2024 entry", "body": "In total, the country has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 64 times - but they have only won once, in 1986.\n\nThere was a period of time when Belgium's performances in Eurovision felt fraught - in the 2000s, the country failed to reach the semi-finals for five consecutive years.\n\nBut since 2010, the country's fortunes seem to have turned around, placing in the top 10 five times, and finishing seventh in 2023.\n\nBut who is Mustii? Will he be the one to help bring glory back to Belgium? Here's what we know.\n\nThomas Michel 'Mustii' Mustin is a Belgian actor, singer and songwriter.\n\nAs part of his music career, he has released two albums, 21st Century Boy and It's Happening Now. Both of these albums peaked as top 10 hits, but Mustii hasn't just got a thriving music career - he is also known for being a judge on Drag Race Belgium.\n\n\"When they asked me to do Eurovision I accepted the challenge, but I knew I had to go with a strong message,\" he told Eurovision World.\n\n\"I thought that if I was really going there, it would be to unite people.\"\n\nBelgium's Eurovision song is Before the Party's Over.\n\nIn an interview, Mustii said of the song: \"It's a song from my own DNA. It took me some time to find resilience and to fight to be exactly whoever I wanted to be and that's the story of my song. It's sort of divided in a few parts.\n\n\"In a first moment, we acknowledge the struggle we're going through, but at one point we realise we need to look for our inner fire to fight it because we are running out of time.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.

It became eligible after becoming part of the European Broadcasting Union, which is behind the event.\n\nThe rule also allows countries like Azerbaijan, who hosted in 2012, and Georgia to compete.\n\nEBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete and the country being different from Russia who invaded Ukraine.\n\nOn the Eurovision website, it states \"Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values\".\n\nDefending the decision on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\" as an apolitical member organisation.\n\nHe also said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member-led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan ... met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\n- Has Israel won?\n\nThe Eurovision has previously provided Israel with some cultural touchstones following first winning with Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta's Abanibi in 1978.\n\nHallelujah became the country's unofficial national song after Milk and Honey won the contest for Israel in 1979, and Dana International became a national hero and global transgender icon when she won with Diva in 1998.\n\nNetta Barzilai's catchy pop anthem Toy won the 2018 Eurovision competition.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nFinnish, Swedish, Irish and Icelandic musical artists have also called for Israel to be prevented from competing and for their acts to not go along to the contest.\n\nOn April 25, protests were held outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London by the LGTBQ+ solidarity group Queers For Palestine. Similar demonstrations were also held in Barcelona, Amsterdam Reykjavik.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been calls for a boycott, in 2019 when the contest was held in Tel Aviv, artists including former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters, electronic music pioneer Brian Eno and movie directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh urged musicians not to attend.\n\nYears and Years singer Alexander, Irish entrant Bambie Thug along with Norway's Gate, Portugal's Iolanda, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo, Lithuanian singer Silvester Belt and Finland's Windows95Man/Teemu Keisteri have all rejected calls to boycott the contest.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement they did call for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages\" and said they \"stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia\".\n\nThug also told the PA news agency that they \"do not agree with the decision\" the EBU made by allowing Israel to take part.\n\n\"I am pro-Palestine through and through and without us there, there would be less voices that are pro,\" they also said.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news",

prepares to host the competition's second semi-final on Thursday night, in which Israel's entrant Eden Golan is performing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms Golan was booed during a rehearsal of her song Hurricane.\n\nA smaller demonstration in support of Israel has also taken place.\n\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg was among those attending the pro-Palestinian protest.\n\nShe told the BBC that there was a \"moral obligation to act\" and to speak out against Israel's military operation in Gaza.\n\n\"If we are tens of thousands of people flooding the streets of Malmo when Eurovision is taking place, saying we will not accept this to continue, then it's a very strong signal - and it does make a difference,\" Ms Thunberg said.\n\nAnother protester, Matilda Varatta, told Reuters news agency that she would like to see Israel disqualified as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"It's not true that the Eurovision is not political, it has always been political, and it will always be,\" she said.\n\nEarlier, Ms Golan said that she was \"proud to represent my country\" and that \"nothing will deter\" her.\n\n\"I'm focused on music, on the good energy, and there are so many people supporting me, and I feel like I have such an honour to represent my country, especially in these times\".\n\nAt the pro-Israel demonstration, people could be heard singing Hurricane in support of Ms Golan amid a significant police presence.\n\n\"I'm not that interested in Eurovision,\" one demonstrator, Yael Sages Wahlstr\u00f6m, told Sweden's Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.\n\n\"But since there has been such a huge storm of hate against Israel, I wanted to support\".\n\nThe Israeli Broadcasting Corporation, which organises the country's contest entry, says it has asked the European Broadcasting Union to prevent a repeat of Wednesday's booing incident.\n\nThe Swedish authorities say they have heightened security in place and are prepared for

I can't have fun knowing that Israel is there participating when all those kids are dying. I think it's just wrong,\" 30-year-old protester Hilda, who did not want to provide her surname, told AFP.\n\nThe war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael in response vowed to crush Hamas and launched a military offensive that has killed at least 34,904 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nMilitants also took about 250 hostages.

It became eligible after becoming part of the European Broadcasting Union, which is behind the event.\n\nThe rule also allows countries like Azerbaijan, who hosted in 2012, and Georgia to compete.\n\nEBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete and the country being different from Russia who invaded Ukraine.\n\nOn the Eurovision website, it states \"Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values\".\n\nDefending the decision on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\" as an apolitical member organisation.\n\nHe also said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member-led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan ... met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\n- Has Israel won?\n\nThe Eurovision has previously provided Israel with some cultural touchstones following first winning with Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta's Abanibi in 1978.\n\nHallelujah became the country's unofficial national song after Milk and Honey won the contest for Israel in 1979, and Dana International became a national hero and global transgender icon when she won with Diva in 1998.\n\nNetta Barzilai's catchy pop anthem Toy won the 2018 Eurovision competition.\n\n- Who wants a boycott?\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nFinnish, Swedish, Irish and Icelandic musical artists have also called for Israel to be prevented from competing and for their acts to not go along to the contest.\n\nOn April 25, protests were held outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London by the LGTBQ+ solidarity group Queers For Palestine. Similar demonstrations were also held in Barcelona, Amsterdam Reykjavik.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been calls for a boycott, in 2019 when the contest was held in Tel Aviv, artists including former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters, electronic music pioneer Brian Eno and movie directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh urged musicians not to attend.\n\nThey were criticised by Stephen Fry, Sharon Osbourne, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who signed an open letter from the non-profit organisation Creative Community for Peace.\n\n- What have acts said?\n\nYears and Years singer Alexander, Irish entrant Bambie Thug along with Norway's Gate, Portugal's Iolanda, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo, Lithuanian singer Silvester Belt and Finland's Windows95Man/Teemu Keisteri have all rejected calls to boycott the contest.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement they did call for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages\" and said they \"stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia\".\n\nThug also told the PA news agency that they \"do not agree with the decision\" the EBU made by allowing Israel to take part.\n\n\"I am pro-Palestine through and through and without us there, there would be less voices that are pro,\" they also said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Israel launched the assault after Palestinian group Hamas led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,139 people, mostly civilians, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics.\n\nEurovision has resisted calls to eject Israel but asked the country to modify the lyrics of its original song, October Rain, which appeared to reference the Hamas attack.\n\nCritics have pointed out that Russia was expelled in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus was excluded the previous year following a crackdown on protesters.\n\nProtesters congregated in the city's town hall before a planned march to a park close to the contest venue.\n\nThe Israeli government warned that there was \"tangible concern\" that Israelis could be attacked, and Lotta Svensson, a police incident commander, told the news outlet Reuters over the weekend that law enforcement was \"keeping a bit of an extra eye on Israel\" because of high tensions over the war in Gaza.\n\nBut police said on Thursday that the protest has been mostly calm. A pro-Israel demonstration was also scheduled for later in the day.\n\n\"I'm here today because I see the hypocrisy and double standards around the world,\" a Palestinian protester named Amar told Reuters. \"We are against what's happening in Gaza right now. But I also want people to understand that we don't hate Jews.\"\n\nThe song was renamed Hurricane and Israel's participating singer, Eden Golan, was allowed to remain in the competition. Golan was booed during her rehearsal for her performance.\n\n\"We're supposed to be united by music but we're not united, because Israel is participating,\" Malmo resident Anders Trolle-Schultz, who attended the protest, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"I think Malmo should have kept Eurovision, but we should have told Israel either 'Stay away,' or maybe even say, why don't we invite a Palestinian music group to participate?

There is not the same sense of joy, there has been discord.\"\n\nOn Wednesday evening the Israeli representative Eden Golan performed at the dress rehearsal of the semi-final. She was booed when she took to the stage.\n\nEurovision fan Josslpin Pioffet was in the arena that evening, and at yesterday's demonstration.\n\n\"There was some boo-ing, and some cheering and some people protested silently: they turned their backs, covered their ears and bowed their heads during Israel's song,\" he said.\n\nSara Robeh, who is of Palestinian heritage and living in Malmo, said it was meaningful to see thousands of people showing up in the city in an act of solidarity for the Palestinian city.\n\n\"It means a lot that so many people support Palestine. We are against people killing people, we are against people killing kids for no reason and that's why we are here. The genocide has to stop.\"\n\nKlaus Goldschmitt had travelled from Copenhagen and was part of the group Jews for Just Peace.\n\nHe said a cultural boycott was important as it would show Israel how much the world objected to its actions.\n\nLater in the day in another area of town, a pro-Israeli demonstration was held.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli director of delegation told some press gathered in the media centre: \"It is a mission for us to be here and to hear our voices. The song is so accurate. 'I am still broken from this hurricane' - we've been through awful things this year.\"\n\nIreland's Bambie Thug has been criticised by campaigners for declining to boycott the event. However, during rehearsal this week, they were asked to remove Ogham writing from their body which read 'ceasefire' and 'freedom', in a nod to their solidarity with the Palestinian people.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the semi-final on Thursday, Ireland's head of delegation, Michael Kealy, said RT\u00c9 would never consider boycotting the song contest, despite calls to do so.\n\n\"We are a public service broadcaster and we don't take political stands on issues when it comes to things like this. The BBC don't, French television don't, STV don't, no public service broadcaster in Europe would,\" he said.\n\n\"Because if we withdraw, that's the end of the Olympics, that's the end of the Euros, that's the end of the World Cup. All the fun in our lives would be taken away.\"\n\nHe also spoke about Ireland making it through to the Grand Final.\n\n\"I think our act is so different and unique and it is clearly not everyone's cup of tea just judging by what people say online but you can't ignore it. You cannot ignore it. It is a piece of art, it is a piece of theatre. Bambie is a true artist and I think they are going to be a global star no matter what happens here on Saturday.\"\n\nWhile Bambie was not at the arena last night, there was Irish representation on stage as songwriter Liam Geddes has written the Latvian entry Hollow.\n\nOne of the most energetic performances of the night was Netherland's act Joost with his song Europapa.\n\nThe pulsating techno track saw the artist wearing giant blue shoulderpads and dancing about the stage.\n\nDespite the comedic staging, the song has a surprisingly poignant underlying message.\n\nPerformer Joost's father died of cancer when he was 12 and shortly afterwards his mother died of cardiac arrest.\n\nThe song is about an orphan traveling around Europe and trying to discover who they are.\n\n\"When I was younger I promised my parents one day I would go to Eurovision but unfortunately they passed away when I was around 12 so it's an ode to my dad and mum.\"\n\nThe non binary Swiss act Nemo was another bookmakers favourite, their song the Code was about self exploration and contained rap. It has been dubbed an 'operatic dance track with rap' or 'Popera'.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Because of the inclusion, there have been a number of calls to boycott the competition from various countries.\n\nOver 1,000 Swedish artists, for instance, called for Israel to be banned this year, including Robyn, Fever Ray, and First Aid Kit. Similarly, over 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals signed a petition to ban the country from taking part in the contest as well.\n\nIsrael also stirred controversy with their entry song. Originally titled 'October Rain', the track appeared to contain references to the victims of Hamas' October 7 attacks and was barred from performance due to breaking rules on political neutrality. Though Israel originally threatened to withdraw from the competition if any changes were to be made, a call from Israeli president Isaac Herzog for \"necessary adjustments\" to ensure Israel's participation has prompted their public broadcaster KAN to agree to amend the song.\n\nOn March 9, Israel was confirmed to compete after changes were made to the lyrics and the song's title was changed to 'Hurricane'.\n\nMore recently, Eurovision organisers confirmed that they reserve the right to remove Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols during this year's final, and have again defended their decision not to boycott Israel.\n\nFollowing footage of the crowd booing her performance in last night's semi-final rehearsal, shown above, Golan shared a statement reading (via EuroNews): \"I am proud to represent my country, particularly this year. I am receiving support and love and I am determined to give my best performance tomorrow in the semifinal and nothing will deter me from that goal!\"\n\nThe 20-year-old singer also went on to say that she wouldn't be letting the uproar affect her as Israel's presence on the Eurovision stage \"has such huge significance and meaning, because of what we're going through.\"\n\n\"I won't let anything break me, or move me off track,\" she said (via New York Times) \"I am here to show the voice of an entire nation. To show that we're here, that we are strong, but emotional and broken.\"\n\n\"What's under my control is to give the best performance ever, to touch people's souls, to make them feel something,\" Golan added. \"I know I'm not in this alone. Maybe I'm the one standing on stage performing and singing, but I have our entire country behind me and with me and I'm going to represent us.\"\n\nThe grand finale of Eurovision 2024 is set for May 11 and will be held in Malm\u00f6, Sweden - the country of last year's winner, Loreen.\n\nAll contestants have been barred by regulations from making any political statements on stage, and fans in the audience are banned from displaying any flag outside of the countries competing in the competition.\n\nIn the first half of the semi-finals (May 7), opening act Palestinian-Swedish singer Eric Saade -- who had previously criticised the decision to ban Palestinian flags - wore a Palestinian keffiyeh around his wrist as a form of protest. This was later condemned by the EBU (via Times Of Israel).\n\nThe outlet also reported that Australian musician Fred Leone wore body paint on stage resembling a watermelon, as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nYesterday (May 8), it was confirmed that Ireland's Eurovision entry Bambie Thug was forced to change their pro-Palestine message by the competition's organisers. This came after they performed at the first wave of semi-finals wearing an outfit that showed body paint in Ogham script - an early Mediaeval alphabet - which translated to ceasefire and freedom.\n\nSpeaking of the change, the singer said: \"It was very important for me because I'm pro-justice and pro-peace. Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\"\n\nThere has been pressure on contestants, including Bambie Thug and UK representative Olly Alexander to boycott the event in solidarity with Palestine. However, in a collective statement, the two reaffirmed their pro-Palestine stance whilst announcing they would not boycott.\n\nIsrael is still set to compete, and the second half of semi-final shows will be held tonight, ahead of the weekend's finale.

It became eligible after becoming part of the European Broadcasting Union, which is behind the event.\n\nThe rule also allows countries like Azerbaijan, who hosted in 2012, and Georgia to compete.\n\nEBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete and the country being different from Russia who invaded Ukraine.\n\nOn the Eurovision website, it states \"Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values\".\n\nDefending the decision on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\" as an apolitical member organisation.\n\nHe also said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member-led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan ... met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nThe Eurovision has previously provided Israel with some cultural touchstones following first winning with Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta's Abanibi in 1978.\n\nHallelujah became the country's unofficial national song after Milk and Honey won the contest for Israel in 1979, and Dana International became a national hero and global transgender icon when she won with Diva in 1998.\n\nNetta Barzilai's catchy pop anthem Toy won the 2018 Eurovision competition.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nFinnish, Swedish, Irish and Icelandic musical artists have also called for Israel to be prevented from competing and for their acts to not go along to the contest.\n\nOn April 25th, protests were held outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London by the LGTBQ+ solidarity group Queers For Palestine. Similar demonstrations were also held in Barcelona, Amsterdam Reykjavik.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been calls for a boycott, in 2019 when the contest was held in Tel Aviv, artists including former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters, electronic music pioneer Brian Eno and movie directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh urged musicians not to attend.\n\nThey were criticised by Stephen Fry, Sharon Osbourne, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who signed an open letter from the non-profit organisation Creative Community for Peace.\n\nYears and Years singer Alexander, Irish entrant Bambie Thug along with Norway's Gate, Portugal's Iolanda, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo, Lithuanian singer Silvester Belt and Finland's Windows95Man/Teemu Keisteri have all rejected calls to boycott the contest.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement they did call for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages\" and said they \"stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia\".\n\nThug also told the PA news agency that they \"do not agree with the decision\" the EBU made by allowing Israel to take part.\n\n\"I am pro-Palestine through and through and without us there, there would be less voices that are pro,\" they also said.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors":

RSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 9 May 2024, 6:42 AM Last updated: Thu 9 May 2024, 7:08 AM\n\nBy Charlotte McLaughlin, PA Senior Entertainment Reporter\n\nThe Israel entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest will perform amid several campaigns to block the country from taking part this year following an outbreak of war in the Middle East.\n\nBefore even taking part, Eden Golan being in the contest on Thursday at Malmo Arena has drawn a backlash following Israel being attacked and the fallout of conflict in the Gaza Strip seeing more than 33,000 Palestinians killed since October.\n\nThe Israel-born singer, who grew up in Russia, saw her original track, October Rain, cause controversy as the lyrics were thought to reference militant group Hamas kidnapping and killing Israelis on October 7th and has since been changed.\n\nIn March, Israel unveiled Hurricane, a soulful and heartfelt track that was then approved by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\n\nHere is a round-up of questions about Israel taking part:\n\nA post shared by EDEN GOLAN (@golaneden)\n\nWhy is Israel in the contest?\n\nNon-European countries are far more common than one might expect.\n\nIsrael made its Eurovision debut in 1973. It became eligible after becoming part of the European Broadcasting Union, which is behind the event.\n\nThe rule also allows countries like Azerbaijan, who hosted in 2012, and Georgia to compete.\n\nEBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete and the country being different from Russia who invaded Ukraine.\n\nOn the Eurovision website, it states \"Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values\".\n\nDefending the decision on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\" as an apolitical member organisation.\n\nHe also said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member-led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan ... met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nHas Israel won?\n\nThe Eurovision has previously provided Israel with some cultural touchstones following first winning with Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta's Abanibi in 1978.\n\nHallelujah became the country's unofficial national song after Milk and Honey won the contest for Israel in 1979, and Dana International became a national hero and global transgender icon when she won with Diva in 1998.\n\nNetta Barzilai's catchy pop anthem Toy won the 2018 Eurovision competition.\n\nWho wants a boycott?\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\nFinnish, Swedish, Irish and Icelandic musical artists have also called for Israel to be prevented from competing and for their acts to not go along to the contest.\n\nOn April 25th, protests were held outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London by the LGTBQ+ solidarity group Queers For Palestine. Similar demonstrations were also held in Barcelona, Amsterdam Reykjavik.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been calls for a boycott, in 2019 when the contest was held in Tel Aviv, artists including former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters, electronic music pioneer Brian Eno and movie directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh urged musicians not to attend.\n\nThey were criticised by Stephen Fry, Sharon Osbourne, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who signed an open letter from the non-profit organisation Creative Community for Peace.\n\nWhat have acts said?\n\nYears and Years singer Alexander, Irish entrant Bambie Thug along with Norway's Gate, Portugal's Iolanda, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo, Lithuanian singer Silvester Belt and Finland's Windows95Man/Teemu Keisteri have all rejected calls to boycott the contest.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement they did call for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages\" and said they \"stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia\".\n\nThug also told the PA news agency that they \"do not agree with the decision\" the EBU made by allowing Israel to take part.\n\n\"I am pro-Palestine through and through and without us there, there would be less voices that are pro,\" they also said.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 9 May 2024, 6:42 AM Last

But now with the semi-final just hours away, a question that seems to be on everyone's lips is why the country was allowed to take part in the European competition in the first place.\n\nEden has been at the centre of huge backlash ahead of tonight's semi-final after Israel had been attacked which prompted a tragic conflict in the Gaza Strip that saw more than 33,000 Palestinians killed since October last year. The Israel-born singer, who grew up in Russia, was forced to change her original track October Rain as many thought the lyrics referenced the militant group Hamas kidnapping and killing Israelis on October 7.\n\nAnd so the song was changed to Hurricane in March, which was deemed more heartfelt and was then approved by the European Broadcasting Union. The controversial country had first competed in the competition back in 1973. It's eligibility came on the back of being part of the EBU, which is behind the running of the event.\n\nIsrael contestant Eden Golan prepares to perform at this year's Eurovision Song Contest semi-final amid backlash over war in Middle East\n\nUnlike Russia, who had their EBU membership suspended two years ago, Israel is still able to compete. Defending its decision making process, the Eurovision website issued a statement that read: \"Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values.\"\n\nAnd in a widely watched interview with Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, who is the Deputy Director General of the EBU said that if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war. The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\"\n\nHe then added: \"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member-led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan ... met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\nEden is one of 16 acts who will sing in tonight's semi-final and whether she goes through to the final on Saturday will be down to a public vote from every other country except her own. The most popular acts will then go through to the final, which will be shown on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucretia_munro@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lucretia Munro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC iPlayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32773227.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Why-is-Israel-competing-at-Eurovision.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1017, "textEnd": 1026}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

However, some just stopped by before moving on to the big arena in suburban Hyllie, where the ticketed show takes place.\n\nEurovision fans and drag queens Aresty and Coco del Mar stood outside the entrance, where they flashed their traditional festive dresses from the Netherlands. Both are ready to cheer for their Dutch home country at the live show tonight at in Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\n\"We are very excited. It is such a big party. And our expectations are sky high that Holland can win this year,\" they said.\n\nBoth were in Malm\u00f6 11 years ago in 2013, when the city hosted and Swedish artist Loreen had won with her smash hit \"Euphoria\" a year prior. Loreen secured another victory for Sweden in 2023 with the song \"Tattoo.\"\n\nThe Dutch delegation noted, however, that the party mood seemed a bit more muted now.\n\nFrida Hansson, one of the roughly 500 locals who signed up as volunteers in the Eurovision week, said it is not surprising that the celebrative vibe is somewhat more low-key this year.\n\n\"Security is up, and we have seen a lot of protests. People have probably been a bit worried, but it has nonetheless been very calm and respectful with police officers and guards creating a very safe environment,\" she said.\n\nHansson referred to the ongoing pro-Palestinian protests on the situation in Gaza.\n\nDemonstrations over the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza were expected to culminate Thursday ahead of Israeli singer Eden Golan's performance of the entry \"Hurricane\" in the second semifinals. The protests grew in Malm\u00f6's big central square (Stortoget), where thousands of people from especially Sweden and Denmark gathered to demand a boycott of Israel in the Eurovision and an end to the casualties and attacks in Gaza.\n\nWhile smoke in the Palestinian flag's red, green, black and white colors spread over the crowd, someone shouted from the stage that \"either Israel leaves the Eurovision, or the Eurovision leaves Malm\u00f6.\"\n\n\"I came to help open the eyes of world -- both Sweden and the U.S.,\" said Jenny Oberg, a Swede who came all the way from Stockholm on a bus for \"Palestinian friends\" to join the pre-Eurovision demonstrations.\n\n\"It is not OK for Israel to participate in a contest, when they have killed over 40,000 people, many of them children,\" Oberg said. When pressed on whether a cultural and musical competition should include all countries regardless of any ongoing conflicts or political clashes, she answered: \"Russia was banned. And Israel has killed more people.\"\n\nMalm\u00f6 has prepared for the Eurovision and arrival of 100,000 visitors for weeks, bringing in extra security and police staff from all over Sweden. They are visible almost everywhere on the streets, and there are no bags or belongings allowed in the Eurovision Village.\n\nLarge police vans surrounded the protests, though no violent clashes or known security issues have occurred despite the fact that protesters have come very close to the Eurovision party zone flanked by the slogan \"United by music.\"\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of Israel held a small counter-demonstration in central Malm\u00f6 on Thursday, where they reportedly waved Israeli flags and played quiet music.\n\n\"Malm\u00f6 has tried to balance protests and celebrations, so that everyone can speak their voice, while avoiding tension between groups,\" Hansson, the volunteer, said.\n\nAfter Thursday's semifinal, 26 contestants move on to the finals Saturday evening.",

Israel's Edan Golan was one of the 16 competing acts performing to win one of 10 places in the grand final. But Israel's entry has caused controversy as some believe they should not have been allowed into the contest due to the conflict in Gaza. For that reason many Eurovision fans are staging a boycott of the contest this year.\n\nDespite the controversy Israel has been voted through to the final on Saturday night by the public. The UK did not vote, as they had the semi-final vote on Tuesday night.\n\nIsrael's Edan Golan took to the stage to perform her song Hurricane in the second semi-final. She needs the public vote to go through to the final.\n\nIt was reported that a small number of people walked out of the room when Golan began her performance. Among them were former Ireland Eurovision act Jedward. A video on social media showed a man waving a Palestinian flag being removed from the venue during Israel's performance.\n\nDuring the ballad the crowd was certainly not as vocal as during the other performances of the night.\n\nSome viewers observed there seemed to be an 'awkward' silence during the performance, while others claimed they could hear booing. Others alleged the broadcast was using fake crowd noises as \"anti-booing technology\" to drown out the true reaction from the audience.\n\nOne wrote on social media platform X: \"I could hear booing even over the fake crowd noise #Eurovision.\" Another commented: \"I'm not surprised Israel is getting booed #eurovision.\" Another claimed: \"some serious anti-booing technology at work here #eurovision.\" And another observed: \"Anti-booing technology worked overtime tonight lol #Eurovision.\" Another asked: \"Are they just nerfing the audio? You can still hear the booing tbh #Eurovision.\"\n\nThere was support online for Edan Golan by viewers who felt she put on a good effort in difficult circumstances.\n\nOne posted: \"Easily the most emotional moment of this year's eurovision hurricane is such a beautiful song and eden golan performs it flawlessly, israel is standing strong and proud and it's here to stay no matter the hate! [sic]\" Another said: \"seeing israel performing at eurovision 7 months after the terrorist attacks and the antisemitism that's burst out since then is beautiful eden golan is a symbol of the resilience and strength of all israeli people.\" And another shared: \"14. Israel Politics aside (as it should be in this comp!), a brilliant song and performance. #Eurovision #ISR #YSR\"\n\nBut others voiced their displeasure.\n\nOne wrote: \"#Eurovision Israel's participation is a SHAME.\" Another posted: \"Not really watched or been interested in #EUROVISION this year so far tbh but watching the semi final. The Israel song is prob the best I've heard tonight and the singer has a great voice . However I would never in a million years vote for them, not even if they paid me.\" And another said: \"Even if Israel had been best song, it's not getting public vote, is it? #Eurovision\"\n\nIsrael launched its offensive on Palestinian enclave Gaza in response to a surprise attack by Hamas on 7 October 2023, which saw 1,400 Israelis killed.\n\nRussia was scheduled to participate in the Eurovision 2022 in Italy. But the country was suspended from the contest in February 2022 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That suspension remains in place and Russia may not participate in or broadcast the song contest.\n\nAlso going through with Israel from the second semi-final are Latvia, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Greece, Estonia, Switzerland, Georgia, Estonia and Armenia.\n\nMalta, Albania, Czechia, Denmark, San Marino, Belgium, Australia, Iceland, Poland, Azerbaijan and Moldova are all now out of the competition.\n\nAlready through to the final are Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland's Windows 95 Man, Cyprus, Luxembourg Croatia's Baby Lasagna and Ireland's Bambie Thug. They will join the 'big five' nations of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK in the competition on Saturday night, as well as hosts Sweden.\n\nCroatia's Baby Lasagna is the bookmakers favourite to win this year with his catchy rock tune Rim Tim Tagi Dim. He has overtaken previous favourite, Switzerland's Nemo Mettler, with song The Code.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It became eligible after becoming part of the European Broadcasting Union, which is behind the event.\n\nThe rule also allows countries like Azerbaijan, who hosted in 2012, and Georgia to compete.\n\nEBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete and the country being different from Russia who invaded Ukraine.\n\nOn the Eurovision website, it states \"Russian public service broadcasters had their EBU membership suspended in 2022 due to consistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service media values\".\n\nDefending the decision on Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\" as an apolitical member organisation.\n\nHe also said: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\n\n\"The Eurovision Song Contest is a music event which is organised and co-produced by 37 public broadcasters, so it's not a competition between nations or governments.\n\n\"We do understand that there was some concern around Israel participating, but when our governing bodies, because we're a member-led organisation, reviewed the participation list of this year, they concluded that Kan ... met all of the obligations compared to the competing rules.\"\n\n- Has Israel ever won before?\n\nThe Eurovision has previously provided Israel with some cultural touchstones following first winning with Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta's Abanibi in 1978.\n\n'Hallelujah' became the country's unofficial national song after Milk and Honey won the contest for Israel in 1979, and Dana International became a national hero and global transgender icon when she won with 'Diva' in 1998.\n\nNetta Barzilai's catchy pop anthem 'Toy' won the 2018 Eurovision competition.\n\n- Who wants a boycott?\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, Queers for Palestine circulated a letter signed by actors Indya Moore, Brigette Lundy-Paine and Maxine Peake calling for UK entrant Olly Alexander to stop participating.\n\n400 Irish artists signed a letter demanding Bambie Thug boycott Eurovision.\n\nFinnish, Swedish, Irish and Icelandic musical artists have also called for Israel to be prevented from competing and for their acts to not go along to the contest.\n\nOn April 25, protests were held outside the BBC's Broadcasting House in London by the LGTBQ+ solidarity group Queers For Palestine. Similar demonstrations were also held in Barcelona, Amsterdam Reykjavik.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been calls for a boycott, in 2019 when the contest was held in Tel Aviv, artists including former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters, electronic music pioneer Brian Eno and movie directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh urged musicians not to attend.\n\nThey were criticised by Stephen Fry, Sharon Osbourne, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons, who signed an open letter from the non-profit organisation Creative Community for Peace.\n\n- What have acts said?\n\nYears and Years singer Alexander, Irish entrant Bambie Thug along with Norway's Gate, Portugal's Iolanda, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo, Lithuanian singer Silvester Belt and Finland's Windows95Man/Teemu Keisteri have all rejected calls to boycott the contest.\n\nHowever, in a joint statement they did call for \"an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages\" and said they \"stand united against all forms of hate, including antisemitism and Islamophobia\".\n\nThug also told the PA news agency that they \"do not agree with the decision\" the EBU made by allowing Israel to take part.\n\n\"I am pro-Palestine through and through and without us there, there would be less voices that are pro,\" they also said.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Meet Iceland Eurovision 2024 entry", "body": "Back then, she came in 19th place, and unfortunately did not qualify for the final this time around.\n\nSpeaking of the result, she wrote on Instagram: \"So grateful for this amazing journey! Although we did not make the finals this time, the love, support and energy we felt are unforgettable.\n\n\"Connecting with all of you has been a dream come true. Thank you to my amazing team for creating something special that touch[ed] hearts and lifted us up and I am endlessly thankful for all the support.\"\n\nSo, while Iceland will not go further in the competition, here is everything you need to know about the Eurovision 2024 entry Hera Bj\u00f6rk, who will no doubt be cheering on the remaining acts.\n\nHera Bj\u00f6rk rose to fame after representing Iceland back in 2010 with her song Je Ne Sais Quoi, and she has continued to stay strong in the music game ever since.\n\nOver the years, Bj\u00f6rk has released four albums and multiple singles, with her Eurovision song being her first release since 2018.\n\nBj\u00f6rk's Eurovision single is called Scared of Heights, which was written by \u00c1sd\u00eds Mar\u00eda Vi\u00f0arsd\u00f3ttir, Ferras Alqaisi, Jaro Omar and Michael Burek.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelyn_mensah@radiotimes.com", "name": "Katelyn Mensah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera_Bj\u00f6rk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hera Bj\u00f6rk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/hera-bjork-eurovision-iceland-2023-2-2159dc8.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The alert which was put out this afternoon highlighted 'large scale' protestswhich are set to hit Malm\u00f6.\n\nOfficials said clashes where possible with multiple events potentially happening at the same time. The Foreign Office said: \"Demonstrations in Sweden are usually peaceful. There are likely to be an increased number of protests in Malm\u00f6 during Eurovision week especially on 9 May when large scale protests are expected for the centre of the city.\n\n\"Where more than one protest happens at the same time, on opposing issues, clashes can occur. Protests can block access routes. Avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities. For more details, see the Swedish Police website.\"\n\nOfficials have previously said there is a chance UK travellers could be targeted by attackers in the current international climate. The Foreign Office said: \"The Eurovision song contest will take place in Malm\u00f6 from 4 May to 11 May. There will be a greater number of people in Malm\u00f6 during this time. Travel around the city may be affected by travel control systems, or protests. See safety and security information if you plan to be in Malm\u00f6, or attending the event.\n\n\"Terrorist attacks in Denmark cannot be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. The authorities in Denmark have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks and made a number of arrests.\"\n\nIn direct relation to the Eurovision, the FO said it was offering text alerts for people to get up to date. It said: \"Eurovision will take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden from 4 May to 11 May 2024. If you are travelling via or staying in Copenhagen to attend:\n\ncheck the official Eurovision song contest website to stay informed check information from the Swedish authorities on the kriseinformation website sign up to get emails alerts on the travel advice for Sweden\"\n\nEurovision Song Contest organisers have said they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols at the show next week in Sweden. The announcement came amid heightened tensions surrounding Israel's participation in the annual music competition over its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups are expected to stage large protests in Malmo to raise awareness of their cause. Michelle Roverelli, the head of communications for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) that runs the show each year, said ticket buyers are only allowed to bring and display flags that represent countries that take part in the event, as well as the rainbow-coloured flag.\n\nThe Geneva-based EBU reserves the right \"to remove any other flags or symbols, clothing, items and banners being used for the likely purpose of instrumentalising the TV shows\", she said. She was responding after Swedish newspaper Goteborgs-Posten reported on Thursday that contest organisers had banned Palestinian flags and political banners at the event.\n\nNational flags are a common sight during the contest as fans cheer on their country's acts and those they support. The glitzy gala, which draws hundreds of millions of viewers each year, is hosting the event from May 7-11 in Malmo in southern Sweden, following last year's victory by Loreen for its performance of Tattoo last year.", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_hurst@bristolpost.co.uk", "name": "Ben Hurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo_(Loreen_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo (Loreen song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00f6teborgs-Posten", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G\u00f6teborgs-Posten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9269951.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Eurovision-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "dateEnd": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1082}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "dateEnd": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 3332, "textEnd": 3340}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 514}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1735, "textEnd": 1740}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Defending the inclusion of Israel, the EBU's director general Noel Curran said, \"The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organization, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nCiting the 2022 exclusion of Russia, Curran said, \"The Russian broadcasters themselves were suspended from the EBU due to their persistent breaches of membership obligations and the violation of public service values. The relationship between KAN and the Israeli Government is fundamentally different to the relationship that exists between those Russian Members and the State, with the Israeli Government in recent years threatening to close down the broadcaster.\" Credit: @Priyant1987 via Storyful", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Lottery_300", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Lottery 300"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.storyful.com/960ba1a09c135f52d0ccfcd70b9f9d46", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 213, "textEnd": 218}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

But the chaotic scenes in Malmo, Sweden, as thousands of pro-Palestine protesters took to the streets ahead of today's May 9th semi-final wasn't exactly sparkling PR for an event trying to unify the continent through music.\n\n\"Young people are leading the way, showing the world how we should react to this,\" Swedish activist Greta Thunberg told reporters at the protest, which saw red and green smoke from flares billowing across the crowd.\n\nThunberg was draped in a keffiyeh (a checkered scarf currently associated with the pro-Palestine movement) -- the same garment the EBU apologized for when it was worn on stage by Swedish singer Eric Saade at the Tuesday semi-final despite a ban on political gestures in performances.\n\nFor years, the EBU has vowed that Eurovision is a \"non-political\" entertainment event, but as Eurovision scholar Mari Pajala jokes, \"Everyone agrees Eurovision is political except the EBU organizers.\" In 2022, the org swiftly suspended Russia from the competition after it invaded Ukraine. Its refusal to ban Israel despite the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the present military action in the city of Rafah seems only to have spurred on protesters at this year's event.\n\nFounded in 1956 and organized annually by the European Broadcasting Union, the contest sees the EBU's member countries select artists to represent their nation in a massive live event (the 2022 show cost the U.K. a reported \u00a324 million, or $30 million) broadcast to an estimated 160 million viewers. Each country delivers a single song, and while there are plenty of inoffensive pop ballads, the rule of thumb, for some, tends to be \"more is more.\" The country with the winning song hosts the next year's competition.\n\nIn 1979, Germany performed a rollicking ode to Genghis Khan. A year later, Luxembourg delivered \"Papa Pingouin\" with a chilling human penguin frolicking on stage. In 2006, Finnish heavy metal band Lordi gave Gwar a run for its money with the winning \"Hard Rock Hallelujah.\" In 2012, ethno-pop band Buranovskiye Babushki, comprised of elderly ladies from the Russian republic of Udmurtia, danced around a bread oven. You get the idea.\n\nStill, things are far less lighthearted this year: When 20-year-old Israeli contestant Eden Golan takes the stage at today's semifinal, she likely will be booed. Golan's original song was called \"October Rain,\" a reference to the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel, but it was deemed too political for the competition and ultimately rewritten as \"Hurricane.\" At the dress rehearsal yesterday, she was greeted with jeers and shouts of \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nSo, to recap, it's a politically fraught, expensive, logistical nightmare -- and it very, very rarely produces a global superstar. (ABBA and Celine Dion are the most notable exceptions.) Simply put, if the Eurovision Song Contest didn't already exist, no one would ever greenlight it today.\n\nHow then, in today's content market, does a show of this scale survive? And how will it weather this year's terrible PR storm?", "source": {"uri": "theankler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theankler.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manori_ravindran@theankler.com", "name":

They came anyway  --  to heal from Oct. 7", "body": "MALM\u00d6, Sweden -- \"It's only a keffiyeh,\" said Nir Cohen Lahav, 43, one of the fewer than 100 Israeli fans attending Eurovision this year.\n\nThe Swedish singer Eric Saade, whose father is Palestinian, made headlines Tuesday night when he wore a keffiyeh, a traditional Arab scarf that has become a symbol of Palestinian resistance, around his wrist during a performance opening this year's Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nEurovision's organizers criticized Saade for acting against the \"non-political nature of the event.\" But to Cohen Lahav, 43, who is attending his 14th Eurovision this year, the gesture wasn't a big deal.\n\n\"The keffiyeh cannot touch me, cannot kill me, cannot hurt me,\" he said.\n\nAnd the idea of Eurovision as a realm untouched by real-world conflicts is just that -- an idea, he said: \"Who says it's non-political?\"\n\n\"Cyprus and Greece vote for each other every year,\" he said. \"The Scandinavian countries do the same.\" Ukraine's Jamala won the contest in 2016 with a song, \"1944,\" that was widely understood to be a criticism of Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\n\"We live in a political era,\" he said, \"we cannot run from it.\"\n\nCohen Lahav, who works in import and export logistics, and his husband, Oz, who does knowledge management, chose to attend Eurovision this year, despite their government's warnings that the contest might be unsafe amid widespread protests against Israel's participation. To the fans who did come, the outside hubbub over the contest has little to do with the kaleidoscopic music extravaganza they know and love -- and the warnings seem, while serious, a little overblown.\n\nTo Cohen Lahav, it's unlikely that a visit to Malm\u00f6 might involve a greater terrorism risk than daily life in Israel. After all, \"on Oct. 7, they came to our house.\"\n\nAnd if the warnings aren't an overreaction?\n\nCohen Lahav, keeping an eye on the fans greeting Lithuanian competitor Silvester Belt behind me as he sat down to dinner in a mall food court adjacent to Malm\u00f6 Arena, shrugged. \"If something needs to happen, it will happen,\" he said.\n\nPeople who are grieving turn to what they love for comfort.\n\nThat is what brought Israeli fans to Malm\u00f6 this year. For many of them, deciding to attend this year's competition was not a choice between caution and risk, but between staying mired in the trauma of Oct. 7, and finding a way back into life. Everyone is telling Cohen Lahav \"be safe, be safe, be safe,\" he said. \"You need to tell me: Have fun.\"\n\nFor Eurovision's truest fans, the culture that has sprung up around the competition is a kind of lifeblood. Cohen Lahav and Oz got married while attending Eurovision in Lisbon in 2018, with a crowd at City Hall made up of their Eurovision friends of all nationalities; the party they threw in Israel, later that summer, was Eurovision themed. The contest's music is \"the soundtrack to my life,\" said Miki Israeli, 46, who even planned to have a Eurovision song play as she gave birth to her daughter, who is now 13. (She ended up having a Cesarean section, but the Eurovision DVDs she watched while she labored still calmed her.)\n\nI met with Israeli before Tuesday's semifinal, in a space near Malm\u00f6 Arena where chicly arrayed priests from the Church of Sweden were setting up for a karaoke party. (The priests, who wore the subtlest clerical collars I've ever seen -- the next day, I caught one of them in a silver suit -- gave us Diet Pepsi and pushed us to sing.) Israeli was covered in sparkles: Sequined jacket, spangled rainbow knee-high socks, pink glitter eyeshadow, fingernails painted an iridescent beetle green.\n\nThis is her seventh time attending Eurovision. She bought tickets for this year's contest long before Oct. 7. Sweden, which is hosting the contest for the seventh time, is something of a Eurovision mothership -- it was here, exactly 50 years ago, that ABBA strutted gloriously onto the world stage -- but she had missed competitions in Malm\u00f6 in 2013 and Stockholm in 2016. (Some fans held a pro-Israel demonstration in Malm\u00f6 in 2013, after three fans from Israel were threatened by a group of young men who allegedly said \"Where are the Israelis staying, we want to bomb the place.\")\n\nIsraeli, who works for Israel's Ministry of Education and regularly performs with the Israeli lip sync Eurovision tribute band EuroFalsh in Tel Aviv, was determined to finally experience a Swedish Eurovision: \"It's like the queen of Eurovision,\" she said, \"I have to come.\" But deciding to follow through on the plan came with costs. \"My mother's not talking to me right now,\" she said.\n\nShe's concerned for her safety, as is every fan from Israel I've spoken to this week. But she's not worried that violence will come from within the Eurovision community. \"I trust the Eurovision fans to, you know, connect with me because of the music,\" she said. The only reason she really considered not attending, she said, was that \"Israel is still grieving.\"\n\nIn the end, that made her case for coming even stronger. Oct. 7 was an attack on the Israeli spirit, she said. Well, Eurovision \"is my spirit, and you won't take my spirit. This is my victory.\"\n\nOn Oct. 7, Nir Harel, who leads OGAE Israel, the Israeli outpost of the official Eurovision fan club, had a one-of-a-kind problem: How was he going to ensure the safety of Andrew Lambrou of Cyprus and Samira Efendi of Azerbaijan, two Eurovision stars who had performed a concert for fans in Tel Aviv on Oct. 5 and were still in Israel?\n\nIt wasn't until both were safely out of the country, said Harel, 46, that he really began to process the personal traumas of the day. (Lambrou was able to leave quickly; Efendi stayed in Israel for two more days after the attack, with Harel visiting frequently to make sure she was safe and well.)\n\nHarel, now a banker, spent a decade in the Israeli air force. His military career ended after he was injured by a suicide bomber in 2001, during the second Intifada. He's made many friends at Eurovision over the years, he said, but he rarely tells those not from Israel of this history. (His first Eurovision was in Malm\u00f6 in 2013; he told his own wife it was a one-time thing.) \"In the bubble, it doesn't matter,\" he said.\n\nThe idea of a Eurovision bubble means something different to everyone. To Israeli, it's a reassurance, a way of staying centered. \"I'm never alone,\" she said, \"because of Eurovision.\" To Cohen Lahav, it's an international network that's supportive regardless of politics: \"After Oct. 7, most of our friends from the Eurovision bubble call us and ask if we're ok.\"\n\nTo Harel, it's a place where \"you're supposed to forget everything. Just relax, just party with your friends.\"\n\nFor some fans from Israel, the lure of that idyll wasn't enough to overcome safety concerns. Harel said 20 Israeli fans canceled their planned trips to Malm\u00f6 in the weeks before Eurovision, with the last deciding not to come only days before the competition began.\n\n\"We're not supposed to speak Hebrew outside,\" Harel said. He would normally drape himself in an Israeli flag while heading to the performances; not this year. He's avoiding Ubers, and when he has to take them, he won't talk to the drivers, because he doesn't want them to ask where he's from. Harel runs the WhatsApp group for Israeli fans, who are here for a good time -- Harel told me his plan for the week was to go to bed at 5 a.m., and wake up at noon -- but in the group, \"I wrote to the friends that they must be adults.\"\n\nFor Harel, it's particularly important that Eden Golan, Israel's 20-year-old Eurovision contestant, knows fans from her home country are with her when she performs. Thursday night, as she competes for a spot in Saturday night's final, he will be in the audience, waving an Israeli flag.\n\n\"I know I can trust her\" to represent Israel well, he said. And in return, it's crucial, too, that \"she knows that we are here,\"\n\nCohen Lahav and Oz were dressed nearly identically, in ripped jeans, silver chain necklaces, and T-shirts, which Oz designed, emblazoned with the couple's favorite lyric from Golan's song, \"Hurricane\": \"Baby, promise me you'll hold me again/I'm still broken from this hurricane.\"\n\nI asked if they thought of a particular person when they heard that line -- who is the \"baby\" they hope to re-encounter?\n\nCohen Lahav began to cry. Oz put his head on his husband's shoulder. \"The dead ones,\" Cohen Lahav said. \"The people that went, and will never come back.\"\n\nCohen Lahav lost friends and family to the Oct. 7 attack. Oz was called up as a reservist, and served three months as a tank medic at the start of the war, leaving Cohen Lahav home alone with their two dogs. Oz plunged right back into his routine as soon as he was discharged; it's easier to not get stuck in trauma, he said, if you go back to work immediately.\n\nFor both of them -- grieving their lost loved ones, and recovering from the brutality of live combat -- the embattled state of being of which Golan sings is still very present. \"This is the hurricane,\" Cohen Lahav said.", "source":

PA Senior Entertainment Reporter in Malmo, Sweden\n\nIsrael singer Eden Golan has made the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo, Sweden, following a public vote.\n\nThe 20-year-old singer, whose emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel, performed at the semi-finals on Thursday evening.\n\nEarlier in the day, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters walked across the streets of Malmo from Stortorget to Molleplatsen to show their support for Gaza and condemn Israel taking part in Eurovision amid the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nGolan opened with a back bend, before launching into her song and received claps and cheers from the audience while dressed in a flowing sand-coloured dress.\n\nThe event's organisers had said they will not \"censor\" the audience after Golan was booed during rehearsals on Wednesday and there were reportedly shouts of \"free Palestine\".\n\nSwitzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop song The Code is seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday, made the final along with Netherlands act Joost Klein, with his irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with the folkish Ulveham.\n\nAlso making the final was Latvia's Dons, Austria's Kaleen, Greece's Marina Satti, Estonia's 5Miinust x Puuluup, Georgia's Nutsa Buzaladze and Armenia's Ladaniva.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

There are also many posters linking Eurovision to genocide, along with Palestinian flags.\n\nWhile no specific danger has been articulated, police spokesperson Jimmy Modin says nothing can be ruled out.\n\nThe police have already been working on their operation to keep the peace during Eurovision for six months, Modin tells Belgian outlet VRT NWS.\n\nHe emphasises that the police will be present on the street during the singing competition, and that pro-Palestinian protests have already been announced.\n\nPolitical debate\n\nBefore the opening ceremony of Eurovision, a political debate took place on the Swedish TV-channel SVT, where several different opinions clashed, according to Berlingske.\n\nNooshi Dadgostar, party leader of the Swedish V\u00e4nsterpartiet, feels that Israel shouldn't participate in the Eurovision.\n\n\"It should be a folk festival. Now its only safety and fear,\" she said.\n\nSweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson cautioned that people \"should be aware that there are forces that want it to become chaotic and turbulent.\"\n\nHe added that he considers the police well-equipped.\n\nLiberal party leader Johan Pehrson told TT that he understands the peaceful demonstrations, but doesn't agree with the violence.\n\nParty leader of the Swedish democrats, Jimmy \u00c5kesson, doesn't want to say that hosting the contest in Malm\u00f6 was a mistake, but highlighted the risk in a TV interview.\n\n\"The situation is in general serious in Malm\u00f6, with widespread antisemitism and Islamism,\" he said.\n\nConflict\n\nThe Israeli entry, Eden Golan, didn't walk on the turquoise carpet at the opening ceremony for safety reasons.\n\nHer song Hurricane had to be changed from the Eurovision Board since it contained too many political references. As did the title October Rain which was interpreted as sailing too close to referencing Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023.\n\nPalestinian flags are not allowed inside the Malm\u00f6 Arena, where the competition takes place, since the board don't approve flags from non-participating countries.\n\nDanish entry Saba already told DR that she gets a lot of criticism about competing in Eurovision. Yet, she feels her absence wouldn't make a difference to the conflict, and so decided to participate.\n\n\"At this moment I think it's hard to concentrate on the Eurovision, since the debate took much of it. To be honest, I don't like it to take off like this,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she doesn't regret her decision to take part.\n\nSaba still stands behind her statement on the matter from when she won the Danish Grand Prix final and qualified for Eurovision: it would be appropriate if Israel would withdraw from the competition, out of respect for the community. But she doesn't want to take a position in the conflict itself, she told DR.\n\nDanish resistance\n\nAt the opening ceremony this Sunday, Saba wore a white blazer with a dove of peace motif on the back, and told Ritzau that she had picked it with care.\n\nIn February, she also appeared in white during the Danish Melodi Grand Prix.\n\n\"It's unconscious consciousness. It became logical given the circumstances,\" Saba explains.\n\nIn February, over 400 Danish musicians signed an open letter to DR, calling for Israel to be excluded from the music festival, and for DR to take an active position against EBU, European Broadcasting Union, who organizes the event.\n\nThe initiative was based on a similar action in Norway and Sweden, where over 1,000 artists signed an open letter.", "source": {"uri": "cphpost.dk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lena_hunter@cphpost.dk", "name": "Lena Hunter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

The alert which was put out this afternoon highlighted 'large-scale' protests which are set to hit Malm\u00f6.\n\nOfficials said clashes were possible with multiple events potentially happening at the same time. The Foreign Office said: \"Demonstrations in Sweden are usually peaceful. There are likely to be an increased number of protests in Malm\u00f6 during Eurovision week especially on 9 May when large-scale protests are expected for the centre of the city.\n\n\"Where more than one protest happens at the same time, on opposing issues, clashes can occur. Protests can block access routes. Avoid demonstrations wherever possible and follow the advice of the local authorities. For more details, see the Swedish Police website.\"\n\nOfficials have previously said there is a chance UK travellers could be targeted by attackers in the current international climate. The Foreign Office said: \"The Eurovision Song Contest will take place in Malm\u00f6 from 4 May to 11 May. There will be a greater number of people in Malm\u00f6 during this time. Travel around the city may be affected by travel control systems, or protests. See safety and security information if you plan to be in Malm\u00f6, or attending the event.\n\n\"Terrorist attacks in Denmark cannot be ruled out. Attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreigners. The authorities in Denmark have successfully disrupted a number of planned attacks and made a number of arrests.\"\n\nIn direct relation to the Eurovision, the FO said it was offering text alerts for people to get up to date. It said: \"Eurovision will take place in Malm\u00f6, Sweden from 4 May to 11 May 2024. If you are travelling via or staying in Copenhagen to attend:\n\nEurovision Song Contest organisers have said they reserve the right to remove any Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols at the show next week in Sweden. The announcement came amid heightened tensions surrounding Israel's participation in the annual music competition over its military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, now in its seventh month.\n\nPro-Palestinian groups are expected to stage large protests in Malmo to raise awareness of their cause. Michelle Roverelli, the head of communications for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) that runs the show each year, said ticket buyers are only allowed to bring and display flags that represent countries that take part in the event, as well as the rainbow-coloured flag.\n\nThe Geneva-based EBU reserves the right \"to remove any other flags or symbols, clothing, items and banners being used for the likely purpose of instrumentalising the TV shows\", she said. She was responding after Swedish newspaper Goteborgs-Posten reported on Thursday that contest organisers had banned Palestinian flags and political banners at the event.\n\nNational flags are a common sight during the contest as fans cheer on their country's acts and those they support. The glitzy gala, which draws hundreds of millions of viewers each year, is hosting the event from May 7-11 in Malmo in southern Sweden, following last year's victory by Loreen for its performance of Tattoo last year.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_hurst@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Ben Hurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Police_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swedish Police Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo_(Loreen_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo (Loreen song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00f6teborgs-Posten", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G\u00f6teborgs-Posten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Six_Flags", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Six Flags", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/wales_online_892/1e032cc9fcdc7679429c002761d306d5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "dateEnd": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1082}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "dateEnd": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 3122, "textEnd": 3130}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 514}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1735, "textEnd": 1740}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Meet Denmark Eurovision 2024 entry", "body": "According to Saba, music \"has always been a huge part of [her] life, so it was kind of natural and not planned\".\n\n\"But I love to perform and to be on stage, maybe because I am a Leo,\" she joked. \"I think it was just a matter of time.\"\n\nBut will this Leo roar? We won't find out until she performs onstage, but here's everything we know about Saba.\n\nAnna Saba Lykke Oehlenschl\u00e6ger is the first Black solo artist to represent Denmark, and the second Black person ever to represent the country.\n\n\"I have always wanted to represent Denmark as a brown person. It's very important to me to be the face of someone I would have wanted to see myself, when I grew up and watched Eurovision,\" she said.\n\nWatching Eurovision, Saba added, is a family tradition. \"I've watched it since I was a little child, and it has always been a dream of mine to be on such a massive stage,\" she told Eurovision World.\n\n\"I work with a lot of different projects, so I wouldn't say I've worked towards this exact moment,\" she added. \"It was only when I heard Sand that I knew it was time.\"\n\nSaba is 26 years old. She was born on the 11th August 1997.\n\nSaba was born in Ethiopia, and at eight months old, her and her twin sister were adopted by a Danish couple and brought to Denmark.\n\nPerforming at Eurovision this year will be a full-circle moment for Saba. \"I remember I was at a hotel's lobby in Denmark watching last year's Eurovision and it just hit me that my turn could be coming, and I felt like I wanted to do it,\" she said.\n\nWhile polls and bookmakers predicted that Saba would be the one representing Denmark, the artist couldn't quite believe it herself. \"It wasn't easy coping with the expectations,\" she added. \"I love being the underdog.\"\n\nRead More:\n\nSaba's Eurovision 2024 song is called Sand. It was written by singer-songwriter Pil, and two Eurovision \"experts\" -- Jonas Thander and Melanie Wehbe\n\n\"When I heard it the first time, I was smiling,\" Saba said. \"I knew it was a good option, and I knew my voice would fit in it. I remember thinking it was nice, different and I just had a good feeling about it.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Denmark, they never made it as far as the final last year. Breaking My Heart by Reiley only got as far as the semi-final, where they finished in 14th place.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_colombo@radiotimes.com", "name": "Charlotte Colombo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saba_(island)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saba (island)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/04/Untitled-design-136be43.png?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1997-08-11", "textStart": 1105, "textEnd": 1121}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

main square before Eurovision protests", "body": "A heavy police presence has arrived at Malmo's main square ahead of protests against Israel's inclusion in the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nOfficers in more than five vans arrived in Stortorget ahead of Eden Golan, representing Israel, taking to the stage on Thursday evening in Malmo Arena.\n\nThe Swedish Police Authority positioned themselves at various entrance points to the square as tourists walked around taking pictures of the fountain and the town hall.\n\nA pro-Palestinian march will take place in the afternoon, which a spokesman for the force said would cause \"disturbance to traffic\".\n\nThe organisers of the march say the demonstration will take place at 3pm, with it ending at Molleplatsen park.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, run by the proscribed terrorist organisation Hamas, puts the Palestinian death toll at more than 34,000 people.\n\nGolan's emotional Hurricane was reworked from a previous track called October Rain, which was thought to reference the Hamas attacks on Israel.\n\nGolan, 20, will compete against Norway's Gate, San Marino's band Megara, Switzerland's Nemo and Danish entrant Saba, who called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the \"safe return\" of Israeli hostages in a joint statement in March.\n\nThe artists rejected calls from Palestinian groups to boycott the music contest, saying that they \"firmly believe in the unifying power of music\".\n\nGolan, who has been singing and dancing on stage since she was a child, told ITV News this week that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\".\n\nThe group, whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.\n\nThe EBU said that he \"chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event\" and it \"regrets\" the broadcast.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Saade said that the material was a \"way of showing a part of my origin\" and was a gift as a child from his father, who is of Palestinian origin.\n\nHe also said: \"I just wanted to be inclusive and wear something that is authentic to me - but the EBU seems to think my ethnicity is controversial.\n\n\"It says nothing about me, but everything about them.\"\n\nIt also told Irish finalist Bambie Thug to change their body paint, which referenced the artist's call for a ceasefire, before going on stage as the EBU maintains this could have broken the rules that are \"designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nIt has won a total of four times, and will face tough competition this year from Switzerland's Nemo, whose operatic-pop music The Code has been seen as one of the favourites to win on Saturday.\n\nThe rehearsals have already shown Golan back bending in a white dress before emerging in a circle flanked by dancers as well as being bathed with yellow light as the song reaches its crescendo.\n\nThere were shouts at the rehearsals on Wednesday, which reportedly included boos and people saying \"free Palestine\".\n\nNetherlands act Joost Klein, with the irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with folkish Ulveham are also seen as likely to progress to the final.\n\nFrance's Slimane with the soulful Mon Amour will also perform on Thursday, alongside Italy's Angelina Mango with La Noia and Spain's Nebulossa with Zorra, but is already through to the final as one of the big EBU donators alongside the UK with Olly Alexander and Germany with Isaak.\n\nThe 2024 hosts of Eurovision are Swedish comedian Petra Mede and Hollywood actress Malin Akerman.\n\nBBC One and BBC iPlayer begin the broadcast of the second semi-final from 8pm on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@jerseyeveningpost.com", "name": "Press

Only time will tell.\n\nBut in the meantime, here's everything you need to know about Isaak.\n\nIsaak Guderian, professionally known as Isaak, is a singer who began his musical career as a street busker.\n\nHe has previously taken part in the German version of The X Factor as well as Show Your Talent, in which he won and saw his star rise to prominence.\n\nSince 2020, Isaak has released 12 singles, including his Eurovision song Always on the Run.\n\n\"Eurovision is a very crazy and artsy world where everyone can just be themselves,\" Isaak told EurovisionWorld.\n\n\"I've always been a fan of thinking outside of the box, and that's what I love about it. In reality, I never thought about competing in it because it seemed so unreachable.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelyn_mensah@radiotimes.com", "name": "Katelyn Mensah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The X Factor (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_performance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Street performance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Strongman", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Strongman", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/isaak-eurovision-germany-2024-86dc056.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Eurovision Party London had been a \"beloved partner...for many years\", it would not host the event while Israel remains in the competition.\n\nThe venue added: \"We will continue to organise fundraising events for the charities we support, including Doctors Without Borders and Medical Aid for Palestine.\"\n\nConfirming the cancellation of the event, Eurovision Party London said the

Her manager later said she thought Eurovision would hinder Rita's chances of becoming a successful solo artist.\n\nRita, 33, has since performed at Eurovision, playing her hits during the semi-finals of the contest in Liverpool last year.\n\nAfter finding fame with Hear'Say on Popstars: The Rivals, Kym left the band in 2002 and tried to carve out a solo career, releasing the album Standing Tall which hit number nine in the charts as well as enjoying two top ten singles.\n\nShe entered Making Your Mind Up - a TV show to find the UK's 2006 entry for the Eurovision Song Contest - with her track Whisper to Me.\n\nBut she only managed fourth place in the competition which was won by Daz Sampson.\n\nBut her disappointment was short-lived as she landed the part of Corrie's Michelle Connor later that year, which she played until 2019.\n\nHer TV career has gone from strength to strength and Kym, 47, is now a regular presenter on BBC Morning Live, starred in the 2022 series of Strictly Come Dancing and plays Nicky Walters in Waterloo Road.\n\nModel Katie hoped that Eurovision would boost her bid to become a pop star when she joined the competition to become the UK's entry in 2005.\n\nWearing a hot pink latex catsuit whilst seven months pregnant with son Harvey, Katie's performance of her song Not Just Anybody was panned by critics.\n\nJavine Hylton was the winner and went on to represent the UK in Kyiv, coming 22nd with the song Touch My Fire.\n\nKatie, now 45, is the first to admit her performance was lacking, saying: \"I was offered a record deal to do Eurovision. I can't sing that song now and I couldn't even sing it then. It's the cringiest thing.\"\n\nMichelle had already proven herself as a woman of many talents when she launched a bid for Eurovision stardom in 2008.\n\nShe had played Hattie Tavernier in Eastenders from 1990 to 1993, before launching a successful pop and R&B career with seven top 40 UK singles, and then took to the West End stage as Belle in Beauty and the Beast.\n\nMichelle's song for Eurovision was Your Decision was Woo (U Make Me) which she also co-wrote, but she came second to X Factor runner-up Andy Abraham. Unfortunately, Andy came last in the actual contest, scoring just 14 points with his song Even If.\n\nMichelle, now 53, has continued with her TV and stage career, as well as becoming a novelist.\n\nThe former Page Three model auditioned for Eurovision with her band Sox in 1995.\n\nSam, 58, had already enjoyed chart success, having released four studio albums and had a number one hit across the world with single Touch Me (I Want Your Body). She had also been nominated for Best British Female Artist in 1988 at the Brits.\n\nBut her Eurovision bid, with Go for the Heart, failed when her band came fourth in the Song For Europe competition.\n\nThe Blue singer represented the UK at Eurovision with his bandmates in 2011, coming a respectable 11th place.\n\nBut this wasn't Anthony's first foray into Eurovision. Back in 2006 he competed to represent the nation as a solo artist with his song It's A Beautiful Thing.\n\nLike Kym Marsh, he too lost out to Daz Sampson, who went on to place 19th in Eurovision with 25 points.\n\nThe longest-serving member of Atomic Kitten looked a credible choice for the UK's Eurovision entry in 2007.\n\nAfter all Liz, now 43, had enjoyed three UK number one singles with the girl band.\n\nBut her song (Don't it Make You) Happy failed to impress the public, and they opted for pop band Scooch as the UK's entry. They eventually came 19th in Europe with their song Flying the Flag (For You).\n\nThe 2007 race for Eurovision was a star-studded affair with the East 17 frontman also competing to be the UK's entry.\n\nThe former boyband star was trying to resurrect his career with the single I Can.\n\nAnd while some viewed Eurovision as a career low-point, Harvey's manager Simon Harrison conceded he had nothing to lose.\n\nHe said: \"To be honest, he hasn't got a career. There are times when an artist wouldn't do this and wouldn't need to.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't give him the boost he needed as he was eliminated after the first round of voting.\n\nShe knows a thing or two about judging, after helping out her ex-boyfriend Simon Cowell on the X-Factor.\n\nBut back in 1984 she was an unknown when she auditioned in a Song For Europe, coming fourth with song

Blood is on your hands too!\" and marched through the streets during the run-up to the semifinals of the contest, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIsrael's entrant into the contest is singer Eden Golan, who will perform the song \"Hurricane\" at 3 p.m. EDT Thursday during the contest's semifinals. During a dress rehearsal, protesters shouted \"Free Palestine!\" at Golan and booed.\n\nSweden has been preparing for the protests, according to Metro, and the outlet included a statement from the European Broadcasting Union, which runs Eurovision, that reads, \"While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.\"\n\nSeveral entrants have supported boycotting the event, and some performers have been disciplined for attempting to express political sentiments during what the EBU considers a nonpolitical event, according to the BBC.\n\nIrish contestant Bambie Thug was forced to remove the messages \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine\" from her face and leg, both written in the ancient Irish language Ogham, while outrage was caused by opening performer Eric Saade wrapping a kaffiyeh around his wrist, according to the outlet. Saade had not worn the kaffiyeh during rehearsals.\n\nThe song Golan will be performing, \"Hurricane,\" was originally called \"October Rain,\" but the name was changed to avoid inferences to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed over 1,200 Israelis and led to at least 250 hostages being taken by the terrorist group.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Golan is Israeli, having been born in Kfar Saba, her father is Ukrainian, and until the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago, she had been a rising pop star in Russia, originally as lead singer of the girl group Cosmos Girls. The outlet further reported that she won the spot as Israel's representative in Eurovision by performing on a TV show, Rising Star, in February.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I feel really sorry for Eden Golan,\" Danish fan Louise Jensby told the outlet. \"She's just a 20-year-old.

Her manager later said she thought Eurovision would hinder Rita's chances of becoming a successful solo artist.\n\nRita, 33, has since performed at Eurovision, playing her hits during the semi-finals of the contest in Liverpool last year.\n\nAfter finding fame with Hear'Say on Popstars: The Rivals, Kym left the band in 2002 and tried to carve out a solo career, releasing the album Standing Tall which hit number nine in the charts as well as enjoying two top ten singles.\n\nShe entered Making Your Mind Up - a TV show to find the UK's 2006 entry for the Eurovision Song Contest - with her track Whisper to Me.\n\nBut she only managed fourth place in the competition which was won by Daz Sampson.\n\nBut her disappointment was short-lived as she landed the part of Corrie's Michelle Connor later that year, which she played until 2019.\n\nHer TV career has gone from strength to strength and Kym, 47, is now a regular presenter on BBC Morning Live, starred in the 2022 series of Strictly Come Dancing and plays Nicky Walters in Waterloo Road.\n\nModel Katie hoped that Eurovision would boost her bid to become a pop star when she joined the competition to become the UK's entry in 2005.\n\nWearing a hot pink latex catsuit whilst seven months pregnant with son Harvey, Katie's performance of her song Not Just Anybody was panned by critics.\n\nJavine Hylton was the winner and went on to represent the UK in Kyiv, coming 22nd with the song Touch My Fire.\n\nKatie, now 45, is the first to admit her performance was lacking, saying: \"I was offered a record deal to do Eurovision. I can't sing that song now and I couldn't even sing it then. It's the cringiest thing.\"\n\nMichelle had already proven herself as a woman of many talents when she launched a bid for Eurovision stardom in 2008.\n\nShe had played Hattie Tavernier in Eastenders from 1990 to 1993, before launching a successful pop and R&B career with seven top 40 UK singles, and then took to the West End stage as Belle in Beauty and the Beast.\n\nMichelle's song for Eurovision was Your Decision was Woo (U Make Me) which she also co-wrote, but she came second to X Factor runner-up Andy Abraham. Unfortunately, Andy came last in the actual contest, scoring just 14 points with his song Even If.\n\nMichelle, now 53, has continued with her TV and stage career, as well as becoming a novelist.\n\nThe former Page Three model auditioned for Eurovision with her band Sox in 1995.\n\nSam, 58, had already enjoyed chart success, having released four studio albums and had a number one hit across the world with single Touch Me (I Want Your Body). She had also been nominated for Best British Female Artist in 1988 at the Brits.\n\nBut her Eurovision bid, with Go for the Heart, failed when her band came fourth in the Song For Europe competition.\n\nThe Blue singer represented the UK at Eurovision with his bandmates in 2011, coming a respectable 11th place.\n\nBut this wasn't Anthony's first foray into Eurovision. Back in 2006 he competed to represent the nation as a solo artist with his song It's A Beautiful Thing.\n\nLike Kym Marsh, he too lost out to Daz Sampson, who went on to place 19th in Eurovision with 25 points.\n\nThe longest-serving member of Atomic Kitten looked a credible choice for the UK's Eurovision entry in 2007.\n\nAfter all Liz, now 43, had enjoyed three UK number one singles with the girl band.\n\nBut her song (Don't it Make You) Happy failed to impress the public, and they opted for pop band Scooch as the UK's entry. They eventually came 19th in Europe with their song Flying the Flag (For You).\n\nThe 2007 race for Eurovision was a star-studded affair with the East 17 frontman also competing to be the UK's entry.\n\nThe former boyband star was trying to resurrect his career with the single I Can.\n\nAnd while some viewed Eurovision as a career low-point, Harvey's manager Simon Harrison conceded he had nothing to lose.\n\nHe said: \"To be honest, he hasn't got a career. There are times when an artist wouldn't do this and wouldn't need to.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it didn't give him the boost he needed as he was eliminated after the first round of voting.\n\nBut back in 1984 she was an unknown when she auditioned in a Song For Europe, coming fourth with song Imagination.\n\nDespite missing out on Eurovision stardom, Sinitta, 60, went on to enjoy chart success with her hits So Macho and Toy Boy.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest",

Blood is on your hands too!\" and marched through the streets during the run-up to the semifinals of the contest, according to the Washington Post.\n\nIsrael's entrant into the contest is singer Eden Golan, who will perform the song \"Hurricane\" at 3 p.m. EDT Thursday during the contest's semifinals. During a dress rehearsal, protesters shouted \"Free Palestine!\" at Golan and booed.\n\nSweden has been preparing for the protests, according to Metro, and the outlet included a statement from the European Broadcasting Union, which runs Eurovision, that reads, \"While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest.\"\n\nSeveral entrants have supported boycotting the event, and some performers have been disciplined for attempting to express political sentiments during what the EBU considers a nonpolitical event, according to the BBC.\n\nIrish contestant Bambie Thug was forced to remove the messages \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine\" from her face and leg, both written in the ancient Irish language Ogham, while outrage was caused by opening performer Eric Saade wrapping a kaffiyeh around his wrist, according to the outlet. Saade had not worn the kaffiyeh during rehearsals.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe song Golan will be performing, \"Hurricane,\" was originally called \"October Rain,\" but the name was changed to avoid inferences to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack that killed over 1,200 Israelis and led to at least 250 hostages being taken by the terrorist group.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Golan is Israeli, having been born in Kfar Saba, her father is Ukrainian, and until the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years ago, she had been a rising pop star in Russia, originally as lead singer of the girl group Cosmos Girls. The outlet further reported that she won the spot as Israel's representative in Eurovision by performing on a TV show, Rising Star, in February.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I feel really sorry for Eden Golan,\" Danish fan Louise Jensby told the outlet. \"She's just a 20-year-old. She isn't responsible for what's going on.\"\n\nProtesters have also organized what they call \"FalastinVision, the Genocide-Free Song Contest,\" for Saturday.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

I get it.\n\n\"We show Eurovision every year because it's unifying, joyful and daft. It's not going to have that vibe this year, so we'll find something else to do instead.\n\n\"Here's hoping we'll be able to enjoy it, collectively, next year\".\n\nUsers quickly flocked to the comments to praise Dreadnought Pub and agreed with their decision.\n\nOne person said: \"Good decision & courage to be upfront & open about it. That's why you are the respected & loved bar that you are.\"\n\nAnother added: \"I think this is the right call. I hope other places follow suit\".\n\nSomeone else wrote: \"Well done for acting on principle\".\n\nWhile a fourth chimed in: \"You have the courage of your convictions in spite of the commercial pressure this can bring, that's why I love the Dreadnought Leith\".\n\nViewers of Eurovision across Europe have participated in protests calling for Israel to be withdrawn from the competition.\n\nCampaign group Palestine Solidarity UK previously called for people to boycott the show's final, which takes place in Sweden on Saturday.\n\nThe group wrote a post on social media which read: \"Palestinians have called for a boycott of this year's Eurovision Song Contest because of the refusal of its organisers to expel genocidal and apartheid Israel from the competition.\n\n\"Participation in Eurovision provides Israel a platform to artwash its ongoing genocide.\"\n\nOn Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, Jean Philip De Tender, the deputy director general of the EBU defended the inclusion of Israel.\n\nHe explained that if you \"exclude Kan (Israeli public broadcaster) outside of these competition rules, that would have been a political decision, as such, which we cannot take\".\n\nHe added: \"We do understand the concerns and the deeply held views that many people have around the war in the Middle East and I think nobody can remain untouched by the profound suffering of everybody involved in that war.\"", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I'm still broken from this hurricane,\" still refer to attacks seven months ago which killed more than 1,000 people and resulted in hundreds of hostages being taken.\n\nDuring an earlier rehearsal on Tuesday, Golan was met with boos and cries of \"Free Palestine,\" and an audience member appeared to have a Palestinian flag removed from them in the auditorium.\n\nThe EBU has said only flags that represent countries taking part, and the rainbow flag, can be brought to the event.\n\nThey have said other \"flags, symbols, clothing, items and banners being used for the likely purpose of instrumentalising the TV shows\" will be removed.\n\nGolan performed her song Hurricane dressed in white and flanked by five backing dancers.

The betting houses suggest that Israel will qualify for the final, and currently give it 8th place among the 32 countries competing (there were 37, but 5 were eliminated in the first semifinal).\n\nIn the general rehearsal on Wednesday, designed for the jury and which included an audience that had paid admission, as is usual every year at this stage of the contest, Eden Golan received boos but also applause. The 20-year-old performer always continued her performance, singing her song Hurricane among the dancers. A spectator raised a Palestinian flag, which was removed by the security service, as there is an express prohibition on displaying Palestinian symbols. In principle, only official flags of the competing countries are allowed to be flown at the galas in addition to the rainbow flag of the LGBTI community.\n\nAlready on Wednesday night, KAN issued a statement: \"Eden proudly took the stage during the dress rehearsal and gave an incredible performance. They did not silence her and they will not silence us. See you tomorrow\". Eden Golan also issued a statement Wednesday evening, The Times of Israel reported. \"I am proud to represent my country, especially this year. \"I am receiving support and love and I am determined to give my best performance tomorrow in the semi-final and nothing will deter me from achieving that goal!\" For security reasons, Eden Golan has spent these days practically confined in her Malm\u00f6 hotel with the Israeli delegation, leaving only for rehearsals and official appointments, and has not gone to promotion parties.\n\nThis Thursday's semifinal begins at 9 p.m. (TVE's 1 broadcasts it live) and 15 countries compete to enter the final on Saturday (10 must remain): Malta, Albania, Greece, Israel, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.\n\nAlso performing this Thursday, as an exhibition, are three countries that have guaranteed access to the final: Spain, France and Italy. The other three countries with direct access to the final (Germany, the United Kingdom and hosts Sweden) also acted as exhibitions in the first semi-final on Tuesday. None of them are put to a vote in the semi-finals: Sweden as the host and the other five as the Big Five, the five countries that make the most financial contribution to the EBU's coffers.\n\nPrecisely this Thursday, the day of the second semifinal with a performance by the Israeli Eden Golan, a pro-Palestinian march brought together thousands of people in the streets of Malm\u00f6. There were between 10,000 and 12,000 protesters, according to estimates by the Swedish police. Some were Danes who had come by bus from nearby Copenhagen, and there was also the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. The protesters chanted slogans such as From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free or Israel is a terrorist state, and also demanded the exclusion of Israel from the Eurovision Song Contest. In the afternoon there was also a smaller pro-Israel demonstration in Malm\u00f6.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [],

Rylan has not confirmed this himself.\n\nGolan was forced to change the lyrics to her song, originally titled October Rain, for breaking European Broadcasting Rules by referring to the October 7 Hamas attack.\n\nNow, the song is called Hurricane - but that did little to quell outrage at Israel being allowed to perform despite the death toll rising in Gaza at the country's hands.\n\nNews broke days ago that a ceasefire could be possible, leading many in Gaza to celebrate on the streets - but not long after Israel launched a major assault on Rafah, which is a vital gateway to Egypt for humanitarian aid and those in Gaza trying to flee war.\n\nMore than 35,000 people - most of whom are civilians - have died in the Palestinian territory since Israel launched military operations in response to Hamas's October 7 massacre, which killed more than 1,000 in Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) put out a message expressing 'regret' that the opening act made a political statement over the war.\n\nThose attending last night's Jury show posted videos on social media which saw Israel's contestant met with boos and protest as she took to the stage.\n\nOne X user called the atmosphere in the venue 'horrible' and said you could 'feel the tension,' while others simply shared videos of the loudly booing crowd.\n\nAnother user claimed a security guard threatened to kick them out for chanting and vocalising their protest during Golan's performance.\n\nThis is despite it clearly stating on Eurovision's website that peaceful protest is allowed at the event.\n\nThe site reads: 'The EBU is a firm advocate for freedom of speech and the right for people to express their deeply held views and opinions. We understand that people may wish to make their voices heard and support the right of those who wish to demonstrate peacefully.'\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch

I want people to know Greeks better, and I cannot find a better way to do so than to show what we have to offer in music.\"\n\nGreece finished in 13th place in the second semi-final at Eurovision 2023 with 14 points. They were represented by Victor Vernicos with the song What They Say.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelyn_mensah@radiotimes.com", "name": "Katelyn Mensah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Satti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marina Satti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Theatre_of_Epidaurus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Concert_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens Concert Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeon_of_Herodes_Atticus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odeon of Herodes Atticus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_cappella", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A cappella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greeks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/marina-satti-eurovision-greece-2024-9ec7f3e.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Following him is Rosa Linn from Armenia, whose 2022 song \"Snap\" did not win Eurovision but still garnered a substantial 990 million streams, demonstrating the impact of Eurovision songs.\n\nItalian rock band M\u00e5neskin, with their 2021 winner \"Zitti E Buoni,\" has made an impact in global interest in rock music, with 461 million streams. Meanwhile, Loreen from Sweden, who won in 2012 with \"Euphoria,\" continues to enjoy popularity with 110 million streams; her 2023 track \"Tattoo\" further proves her ongoing appeal with 483 million streams. These artists demonstrate how Eurovision continues to influence music trends and artist popularity well beyond the competition itself.\n\nThe impressive streaming numbers for songs like Duncan Laurence's \"Arcade\" and others can largely be credited to their popularity on TikTok. This platform has become a major player in the music industry, quickly making songs popular worldwide.\n\nTikTok users create and share videos using these songs, often with dances or challenges, which helps the music connect with a wide audience. This trend not only spreads the songs beyond the usual Eurovision fans but also brings older tracks back into the spotlight and introduces them to new listeners, increasing their streams and cultural influence.\n\nEurovision Legends and Their Global Impact\n\nABBA's victory in the 1974 Eurovision with \"Waterloo\" really kicked off their global music career. The song was a big hit worldwide and set the stage for ABBA to become pop music legends. Their music, known for its catchy tunes and unique sound, still influences musicians today and remains popular with fans of all ages.\n\nJohnny Logan is a standout figure in Eurovision history, nicknamed \"Mr. Eurovision\" because he won the contest twice for Ireland, first in 1980 and again in 1987. His songs are still loved by many, and his performances have set high standards for those who followed.\n\nC\u00e9line Dion's win in the 1988 Eurovision with \"Ne partez pas sans moi\" for Switzerland made her a star beyond the French-speaking world. This boost helped her get a big record deal and paved the way for a hugely successful global career, including hits like \"My Heart Will Go On.\"\n\nConchita Wurst won Eurovision in 2014 with \"Rise Like a Phoenix,\" making a powerful statement against discrimination and celebrating diversity. This win was more than just about music; it was a cultural moment that pushed for tolerance and acceptance, earning Conchita fans worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsbank.net", "dataType":

You have the feeling that you are not welcome in your own city,\" Daniel Janouch, chairman of the Jewish Youth Association, told the German newspaper. \"I know several Jews who want to leave Malm\u00f6 during the ESC.\"\n\nDie Welt noted that Jews throughout Sweden are increasingly afraid of appearing visibly Jewish as the rising population of Muslim migrants in the country has corresponded to skyrocketing rates of antisemitic activity.\n\n\"In a survey by the Central Council of Jews in Sweden, three out of four respondents said they were afraid of openly bearing Jewish symbols,\" Die Welt reported. \"One in two thinks about leaving the country.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is an annual event in which participants - this year, 37 countries, including Israel - send an artist to perform an original song. The best performance, as chosen by a mix of popular vote throughout the participating nations and a panel of elite judges, wins, and that country hosts the next year's tournament. Sweden is the winningest country in the half-century-old tournament, along with Ireland, both of which have won seven times.\n\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of Sweden's 1974 victory in the contest, with the international hit \"Waterloo\" by Abba.\n\nIsrael's participation has for years been controversial given rising antisemitism in Europe generally. This year, the anti-Israel movement, galvanized by the atrocities of Hamas's October 7 terrorist siege of the country, has made anger at the country's presence in the song contest even louder. Hamas terrorists slaughtering 1,200 people, including children as young as infants, on October 7 prompted international leftists and jihadist groups to condemn Israel for attempts to neutralize the Iran-backed jihadists and prevent a repeat of the massacre.\n\nIn April, the Israeli television network Channel 12 sent journalists to Malm\u00f6 to gauge public sentiment prior to Eurovision. The journalists, Ohad Hemo and Elad Simchayoff, discovered widespread support for Hamas, including denials of the atrocities committed on October 7, and faced physical and verbal abuse at the hands of locals identifying them as Israeli.\n\n\"Monkey and pigs have more respect than they do. Pigs are much better than Jews. If it were up to me, there would be no Jews left on this earth,\" one local told the network.\n\n\"I hope they kill you all,\" another local shouted as a group of members of the Muslim community of Malm\u00f6 spat at and threatened the journalists.\n\nSwedish officials have admitted to increased rates of jihadist activity, antisemitism, and other problems stemming from the creation of \"parallel societies\" in the country led by radical imams and other Islamist figures. As a result, the Jewish population has declined. Die Welt noted that the Jewish population of Malm\u00f6 today is about half of what it was in the 1970s, a mere 1,500 people. Malm\u00f6 has seen massive anti-Israel protests all week, which authorities expect to grow larger on Thursday, when Israel takes the stage for the semifinals of the contest, and potentially on Saturday if Israel makes it to the Grand Final.\n\nThe Swedish government has rejected pressure to choose another location for the contest. The organizers of Eurovision, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), have also refused pressure to oust Israel from the contest - though they did demand Israel's performer, Eden Golan, change the lyrics of her song to be less \"political.\" The song, initially called \"October Rain,\" paid homage to the victims of Hamas. The song is now called \"Hurricane\" and contains many of the original lyrics, but not those honoring the children slain by the jihadists: \"they were all good children, each one of them.\"\n\nThe EBU also issued a message reminding participants that the display of the Palestinian flag was not allowed, as it does not represent a country participating in the event. The only non-country flags allowed at Eurovision are the LGBTQIAP2S+ flags.\n\n\"The ESC is a non-political event,\" the official contest rules read. \"All Participating Broadcasters, including the Host Broadcaster, shall be responsible ... to make sure that the ESC shall in no case be politicized and/or instrumentalized and/or otherwise brought into disrepute in any way.\"\n\nIsrael has also refused to back out of the tournament, though Israeli security officials have urged their citizens to avoid Malm\u00f6 during the tournament.\n\nGolan herself has reportedly been forced largely into confinement in her hotel room out of fear of attacks against her person. The Times of Israel reported on Tuesday that the head of Shin Bet, Israel's top security agency, visited Malm\u00f6 a week before the tournament to help arrange security for the Israeli delegation to Eurovision.\n\nGolan is expected to take the stage and perform \"Hurricane\" on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frances_martel@breitbart.com", "name": "Frances Martel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Welt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Die Welt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Waterloo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parallel society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/05/Malmo-Sweden-anti-Israel-protesters-Eurovision.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1939, "textEnd": 1948, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Fans at home felt that Israel should have been temporarily banned from the competition, just like contestants Russia, who have been excluded from competing since launching an invasion on Ukraine in 2022.\n\nHowever, while many viewers condemned the war and felt Israel should be banned, several also felt that Eurovision should extend beyond politics with an open door policy to allow all competitors to band together and compete in a show of unity. With such polarised opinions and such an emotionally charged topic at stake, prior to Eden's performance fans at home were anxious that the 20 year old singer may be interrupted on stage, as had previously happened during the rehearsals for her performance.\n\nIn a dress-rehearsal just hours before taking to the stage, Eden was booed as members of the audience chanted \"Free Palestine.\" However, the singer's live semi-final performance did manage to go off without a hitch as the crowds applauded and cheered her on.\n\nLater in the show, following a public vote, it was soon revealed that Israel had managed to qualify for Saturday's grand final, leading many viewers to race to social media to share their thoughts about the result.\n\nOne fan wrote: \"I'm sorry, what? Israel? Are you f*****g insane?\"\n\nA second fan then added: \"Honestly did not expect Israel to qualify\"\n\nMeanwhile a third fan commented: \"Everyone is going to be absolutely livid that Israel got through to the final\"\n\nWhile a fourth viewer said: \"Is Israel using bots to vote? They hardly go through on public vote\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was so unhappy, with several fans also praising Eden for her performance.\n\nOne fan wrote: \"Congratulations #Israel through to the #Eurovision2024 finals.\"\n\nA second then added: \"Well done Eden! Brilliant song.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of her performance earlier this week, Eden responded to her critics as she revealed that she hoped her performance would help to unite rather than divide viewers. \"It's a super important moment for us, especially this year,\" she said earlier this week.\n\n\"I feel honoured to have the opportunity to be the voice of my country.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Grand Final airs Saturday May 11 at 8pm on BBC One and BBC iPlayer", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phoebe_tonks@ok.co.uk", "name": "Phoebe Tonks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC iPlayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32776017.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-05-09-at-212423.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 2542, "textEnd": 2548}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

They're best known for their unique blend of traditional Norwegian folk music and rock.\n\nIn an interview with Eurovision World, Magnus said that band has \"matured\" a lot over the years, and that \"the timing was just right\".\n\nRead More:\n\nHe added: \"We were invited by the Norwegian broadcaster to join the competition probably given the fact that we've always used historic and original folk elements from our culture in our music.\n\n\"In Eurovision, it's a good thing to represent your country with something unique, original and with a historical touch.\"\n\nUlveham, which is Norweigian for \"wolf pelt,\" is a modern interpretation of a Norwegian medieval ballad.\n\nThe song also features a \"kulokk\" - a traditional Scandinavian herding call - from an archive recording featuring Marit Jensen Lillebuen.\n\nBut once it emerged that the song used 1,000-year-old lyrics, the band faced accusations of plagiarism, and decided to rewrite portions of the song (although the original song was eventually approved).\n\n\"We got a lot of publicity due to that, but it was quite obvious we weren't doing any sort of plagiarism. Not only were we one of the most original acts in the competition, but those lyrics have been written down in so many different dialects and forms over time,\" Magnus added.\n\n\"We showed a sincere effort and decided to do it. Also to calm down the storm here in the country, because we truly received so much attention from the Norwegian press. I am convinced that we also won [the Melodi Grand Prix] because of the controversy.\"\n\nLast year, Norway had their highest ranking since 2013, as they finished in fifth place with 268 points. The country was represented by Alessandra, who sung Queen of Kings.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_colombo@radiotimes.com", "name": "Charlotte Colombo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e5te", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e5te"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Norway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music of Norway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winter Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodi_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melodi Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dialect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scandinavia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/Gate-at-the-London-Eurovison-Party-bef8c14.png?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-13", "textStart": 59, "textEnd": 71}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

We condemn the human rights violations of the Israeli state. Israel is also destroying the freedom of the press. That's why we temporarily interrupt the transmission. #CeaseFireNow #StopGenocideNow\".\n\nThe broadcaster explained its decision to transmit the message nationally, saying: \"We have been watching events in the Middle East with horror for months. We are convinced that the State of Israel is committing genocide and it is therefore scandalous that there is an Israeli candidate in the Eurovision Song Contest.\"\n\nIt continued: \"Doing nothing, just watching, is no longer an option. The EBU (European Broadcasting Union) unfortunately made Israeli participation possible and we therefore decided to interrupt the broadcast. We hope to send a signal to the Israeli government to stop the fighting and killings, allow international observers and the press to enter (Gaza) and sit down for a negotiated solution.\"\n\nSocial media reaction to Israel's participation in Thursday's semi-final was largely negative, with users accusing the EBU of blocking out boos from the crowd. One user wrote: \"Reminder that the Eurovision have anti-booing technology, turned off the audience mics for Israel's performance (and) have fake cheering audio for Israels performance.\"\n\nThe user claims that this video was real footage taken of Eden Golan's performance of Hurricane in the Malmo Arena:\n\nAnother user wrote: \"If you hear cheers for israel during the broadcast it's cause of the EBU is using anti-booing technique trying to cover up boos with fake cheers for tv.\"\n\nEurovision organisers said earlier today that they would not \"censor\" the audience following the boos heard ringing around the arena during Israel's dress rehearsal.\n\nOrganisers, along with Swedish broadcaster SVT, said in a statement: \"Just like in all major TV productions with an audience, SVT work on the broadcast sound to even out the levels for TV viewers.\"\n\nThey continued: \"This is solely to achieve as balanced a sound mix as possible for the audience; and SVT do not censor sound from the arena audience. The same principle applies to all competing performances and opening and interval acts.\n\n\"The EBU (European Broadcasting Union) and SVT encourage all audiences to attend in the spirit of the contest, embracing its values of inclusivity, celebrating diversity and being United By Music.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

It was written by Anderz Wrethov, Jimmy 'Joker' Th\u00f6rnfeldt, Julie Aagaard and Thomas Stengaard.\n\nSpeaking to Eurovision, Kaleen said of the song is about \"needing a place of refuge when your heart is broken, and finding it in music\".\n\nShe added: \"The rave is where the outsiders and wounded souls go to heal and dissolve their problems through music. It's the sea of rhythm that washes the pain away and gives us salvation.\"\n\nAustria came 15th place at the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool.

Here's everything you need to know.\n\nNutsa Buzaladze is a singer-songwriter who will be representing Georgia in the second semi-final. She has been singing all her life, having been part of a singing group at just five years old.\n\nHer solo career kicked off after taking part in Georgia's Got Talent in 2011. Since then, she has taken part in The Voice of Turkey and the Georgian versions of Dancing with the Stars and Your Face Sounds Familiar.\n\nBuzaladze was previously very close to taking part in Eurovision in 2017!

Since then, she has lived in Los Angeles and Dubai, with the latter being where she currently resides.\n\nBuzaladze has thanked all those who have tuned into her Eurovision song, Firefighter.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, the singer wrote: \"I want to say big fat thanks to EVERYONE who showed me so much love yesterday!

Will he do it? Here's what we know.\n\nJoost Klein is a rapper, singer and former YouTuber who posted under the name EenhoornJoost (which translates into UnicornJoost).\n\nAn accomplished musician, Joost has released a total of eight studio albums. Other notable achievements include sold-out concerts in the Netherlands and Belgium, along with over 100 million global streams of his song Friesenjung.\n\nHe is known for blending wacky comedy and imagery with more sombre themes in his music, which has pop punk and hip-hop influences.\n\nJoost Klein is 26 years old. He was born on 10th November 1997.\n\nJoost has ambitious plans for his act. \"The Eurovision performance will be a full-circle experience, turning sorrow into elation,\" he said.\n\nRead More:\n\n\"When people see my act, their first response should be, 'What's going on here?' but then only to find themselves moved. An invitation to dive deeper. At first glance it seems a very happy act, but beyond that lie blood, sweat and tears.\"\n\nThe Netherlands' Eurovision song is called Europapa. Written partly by Joost himself, the song is a tribute to the artist's deceased father.\n\n\"Europapa is about an orphan who travels throughout Europe (and beyond) to find himself and tell his story,\" Joost explains.\n\n\"At first, people don't recognise him, but he goes on seizing any opportunity he gets to let himself be seen. Europapa is a tribute to my father. When bringing me up, he passed on to me an expansive view of the world.\"\n\nThe Netherlands' semi-final entry was the song Burning Daylight, which was performed by musicians Mia Nicolai and Dion Cooper.

Just 4% expect to spend less than \u00a320 on Eurovision night, while the most popular budget for the evening is around \u00a350 (25%). One in five (21%) plan to spend \u00a320, while nearly half (47%) of respondents have budgeted upwards of \u00a350. Almost one in 12 (7%), however, have set aside more than \u00a3100 to spend at a Eurovision party.\n\nAnalysis of respondents' spending intentions by PPL PRS reveals that the night is set to see more than \u00a372 million pumped into the UK's nightlife economy as a result of the Eurovision; the biggest spenders of the night alone could account for a spend injection of more than \u00a321 million.\n\nRecent years have seen Eurovision parties gain traction in hospitality venues - but many now opt to watch at home or a friend's house; PPL PRS' survey reveals that four in five (79%) Eurovision fans will stay home to watch the contest, while one in seven (13%) plan to visit a friend's house for the evening.\n\nCost and comfort drive the trend for avoiding a night on the town; more than half (51%) prefer to stay in for the comfort of being in their own or a friend's home, while for almost one in two (48%), it comes down to staying in being cheaper than going out to an event.\n\nOne in 10 (90%) Gen Z and Millennials are heading out for Eurovision parties this year - with an average intended spend of \u00a342 and \u00a344 respectively. Similarly, those in the Gen X bracket are likely to spend an average of \u00a343, but 96% plan to watch Eurovision at home or at a friend's house.\n\nDespite just 2% of Boomers intending to watch the contest at a public viewing party, purchase intent is much higher; the average spend intent for the generation sits higher than any other at an average of \u00a353 per head.\n\nMore than one in 10 (89%) Londoners are set to spend the evening in hospitality venues for Eurovision with the second-largest average spend intent at \u00a351 per person - with the same to be said for the North East (88%), but with a much lower spend intent of just \u00a335.\n\nOnly Welsh Eurovision fans plan to spend any more than Londoners, with an average of \u00a351, but just 3% of people in Wales intend on spending the evening at a public event. Following Wales, with just one in 20 (5%) planning to attend a public Eurovision party, are those in Northern Ireland and the South East.\n\nThe lowest expected spenders on Eurovision night, along with the North East, are those in Scotland, the West Midlands and the South East, budgeting \u00a337, \u00a336 and \u00a333 respectively on average.\n\nMarianne Rizkallah, music therapist for PPL PRS, explains:\n\n\"Listening to music with other people, especially in response to a live social event such as Eurovision, brings groups together and improves mental wellbeing. Part of it is the music's properties itself - many contemporary Eurovision tracks are upbeat, in a major key and involve a four-to-the-floor drum beat that sounds anthemic and encourages you to wave your hands in the air and sing along. This gearing towards joining in through how the songs are put together places music as a symbol of the collective experience that's being shared while watching Eurovision. The music itself makes you feel good, and being around other people who are hearing the same stimulus and cues as you also makes you feel good.\n\n\"For businesses, using upbeat music that symbolises having a good time with your friends means the groups of people out in venues are more likely to spend their money there, with drinks in bars contributing to the feel-good nature of the night.\"", "source": {"uri": "catererlicensee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CLH News: Caterer, Licensee and Hotelier News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonographic_Performance_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phonographic Performance Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_for_Music", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PRS for Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_&_Years", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Years & Years"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brit Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generation X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_on_the_floor_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Four on the floor (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Key (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Grip", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Grip", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://catererlicensee.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/eurovision-release.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA decade after Conchita Wurst made history and won the Eurovision Song Contest on behalf of Austria, singer Kaleen is hoping for a repeat with her club anthem \"We Will Rave\".\n\nThe 29-year-old singer and dancer is performing at the 68th Eurovision Song Contest, which is being held by host country Sweden at the Malm\u00f6 Arena.\n\nKaleen, who hails from Reid im Traunkreis in Upper Austria, has won more than 100 national and European dance championships, so expect to see some impressive moves when she competes in the second semi-final tonight (9 May).\n\nShe also has plenty of Eurovision experience, having supported countries including Austria, Armenia, Georgia and Germany with their stage performances in recent years.\n\nHer song \"We Will Rave\" was written by Anderz Wrethov, Jimmy \"Joker Thornfeldt, Julie Aagaard and Thomas Stengaard; Kaleen says the track is about \"needing a place of refuge when your heart is broken, and finding it in music\".\n\n\"The rave is where the outsiders and wounded souls go to heal and dissolve their problems through music,\" she told Eurovision. \"It's the sea of rhythm that washes the pain away and gives us salvation.\"\n\nRead our Q&A with Kaleen below:\n\nVery excited! I can't wait to be on the stage having this dream of mine come true. I feel like I've been dreaming this entire time, I'm constantly smiling or feeling nostalgic for little Kaleen who dreamed of being at Eurovision.\n\nIt means a lot to me. Music means a lot, because it can unite so many different people from all different backgrounds. I feel like Eurovision and its United by Music message, I feel like it brings this out in everyone, whether it's the people working on production or the audience, everyone loves it so much. It's crazy that you can spend six months working on a three-minute song, and we're still working on it. It's that love of detail, the love of music, love for our family and our Eurovision colleagues, that makes it such a special moment. It means everything to me.\n\nIt was always my dream to go to Eurovision with one of my songs. So last year in Liverpool I connected with some of the songwriters, and I said it was my dream to take a positive party song to the contest that people could sing and clap along to. I got on a plane to Copenhagen without even having a song, got a train and found myself standing outside the arena at Malm\u00f6! I recorded a song here, and now I have my full-circle moment which is really amazing.\n\nI have a different song in my head every single day when I wake up! This year it's brilliant because I get to meet the people behind the songs and connect with everyone's personality. It's all becoming a blur, so I feel like I have 36 favourites.\n\nThe second Eurovision semi-final takes place tonight (Thursday 9 May) and will be available for UK viewers to watch on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe grand final will be held on Saturday 11 May from 8pm GMT.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchita_Wurst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conchita Wurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurodance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Austria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Upper Austria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderz_Wrethov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anderz Wrethov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC iPlayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/09/16/newFile-16.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 677, "textEnd": 682, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 3018, "textEnd": 3024}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

It's completely crazy when I think about it.\n\n\"My first concerts in the bars of Pigalle, it seems like yesterday. My father taking me to my first casting. And then The Voice. My encounter with the public, the wonderful public that gave me the strength and desire to take on one of the greatest challenges of my career.\n\n\"It's an immense source of pride. A real responsibility, too. In May, I'll be singing in front of almost 200 million people. I'll be singing for my parents. For my daughter. For France. And for you, you for whom I wrote this song...\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections.

Here are the surprising stats", "body": "Anyone familiar with Eurovision will know that the UK is often regarded as the punching bag of the international event.\n\nThe UK is guaranteed a spot in the final thanks to its status as one of the \"big five\" countries that make the largest contribution to the event, which means that Brits are sometimes ridiculed for making it through to the main event no matter the quality of the performance.\n\nBut contrary to that belief - the UK has won the Eurovision Song Contest a total of five times, having first entered the competition in 1957, which places it just behind Sweden and Ireland, who jointly have the most Eurovision wins with seven each.\n\nEntrants from the UK have also placed second in the final 16 times, a record in the contest.\n\nHere, we look back at the UK's winning moments:\n\nAfter five second-place finishes, the UK won its first Eurovision song contest in 1967, 10 years after the competition began, with bare-foot Sandie Shaw's \"Puppet On A String\" and after that the decade brought forth more success for the country.\n\nShaw was awarded points from all the countries except for Spain and Yugoslavia and released a new version of her song last year for charity.\n\nIn 1969, Lulu represented Britain at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Boom Bang-A-Bang\". She became the first tied winner alongside the French, Spanish and Dutch entries, who were all on 18 points each.\n\nThe previous year Cliff Richard came second at 1968's Eurovision, the first broadcast in colour, after his song Congratulations came second to Spain's entry, \"La, La, La\" by Massiel.\n\nHe tried to avenge his defeat by competing in the 1973 contest with the song \"Power To All Our Friends\" and came third.\n\nThe 1970s saw a return to form for the UK as pop group Brotherhood of Man's song \"Save Your Kisses For Me\" won the contest, and also topped the charts in 1976 with their winning song.\n\nThe band's manager Tony Hiller put the song's success down to their TV appearances across France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland the year before the contest and the record sold six million copies, one of the best-performing of recent years.\n\nPop group Bucks Fizz also scored a number one in the UK charts along with winning the 1981 competition with the upbeat \"Making Your Mind Up\" which featured a famous costume trick. The dance routine saw the male singers take off the female musicians' skirts, revealing another one underneath, during the performance.\n\nBy the 1990s for the UK Michael Ball's \"One Step Out Of Time\" and Sonia's \"Better The Devil You Know\" had both finished second and the UK seemed out of luck.\n\nHowever, the Katrina and The Waves song \"Love Shine A Light\" won in Dublin in 1997, causing Britons to dream once more that this contest was theirs for the taking.\n\nShortly afterwards, Imaani came second in 1998 with Where Are You? and Jessica Garlick achieved third place with Come Back in 2002.\n\nDismay for fans followed in 2003, when \"Cry Baby\" by Jemini became the first UK song in Eurovision history that failed to score with group blaming their struggling performance and subsequent 'nul points' on audio problems.\n\nThe 2000s and 2010s were similarly two difficult decades for the UK's waning success at Eurovision, with Andy Abraham, Josh Dubovie, Michael Rice and James Newman coming last from 2008 to 2019.\n\nThough high-profile stars including Bonnie Tyler with \"Believe In Me\" (2013), Engelbert Humperdinck with \"Love Will Set You Free\" (2012) and Blue's \"I Can\" (2011) took part there was no top-five winner since Jade Ewen's \"It's My Time\" (2009) until Essex singer Sam Ryder who raised the UK's prospects in 2022.\n\nRyder entered the competition with his uplifting pop song \"Space Man\", taking second place. The 34-year-old TikTok star topped the national jury vote with 283 points, beating favourites Spain and Sweden, but it was ultimately Ukrainian rap folk band Kalush Orchestra who took the trophy.\n\nFortunes were revived and the UK hosted in Liverpool on Ukraine's behalf in 2023, but Mae Muller's playful performance of her track, \"I Wrote A Song\", came second to last, in 25th place with 24 points\n\nThis year, there are higher hopes for former Years & Years lead singer Olly Alexander and his catchy discoesque track \"Dizzy\".\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest grand final takes place on 11 May at 8pm.

The competition has denied these accusations.\n\nPro-Palestine protests have clogged the streets of Malmo since the competition began, adding a decidedly political backdrop to this year's contest.\n\nThe final will take place amid continued backlash on May 11, with a total of 26 countries competing.\n\nThe UK, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy are known as The Big Five and automatically get to compete in the final, as they contribute the most money to the competition. Sweden will also automatically move on.\n\nIn the first semi finals, ten countries secured their spots in the competition while six went home.\n\nThe first semi final saw Serbia, Portugal, Slovenia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Finland, Cyprus, Croatia, Ireland, and Luxembourg moving on to the finals.\n\nIt was a night full of stirring moments, including the UK's Olly Alexander performing a jaw dropping rendition of his song Dizzy surrounded by scantily-clad dancers.\n\nEven more notably, Ireland's act Bambie Thug blew minds with an iconic performance, qualifying Ireland for the grand finale for the first time in six years.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by

It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelyn_mensah@radiotimes.com", "name": "Katelyn Mensah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puuluup", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puuluup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiwibloggs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wiwibloggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/estonia-eurovision-2024-bbb8fee.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 474, "textEnd": 481}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

However, Israel's participation in this year's contest has put the organization in the eye of the storm, after everything that happened in Gaza.\n\nSince Eden Golan's representation with Hurricane in the Swedish city was announced, the public has protested this fact in every possible way and requested that the EBU back down.

Golan's performance of \"Hurricane,\" a ballad initially titled \"October Rain\" that the European Broadcasting Union, which runs Eurovision, required be rewritten to meet political neutrality rules over its pointed references to Oct. 7, was met with some boos by Thursday's crowd. But the reception was overwhelmingly positive, with much of the audience clapping along, and cheers often drowning out the acrimony. A visibly nervous Golan broke out in smiles after Israel was announced as one of 10 countries from Thursday's lineup to make the final. 11 competitors from the two semifinals, including Malta, Australia, Poland and Belgium, were axed.\n\n\"My heart is so full,\" Golan wrote on Instagram, after the announcement.\n\nA pro-Palestinian protest broke out in front of Malm\u00f6 Arena shortly before the evening's competition began, with riot police making several arrests. Earlier in the day, an estimated 10-12,000 people marched through Malm\u00f6 in protest of Israel's inclusion in the competition. But otherwise, an evening that had been anticipated with warnings of potential safety concerns by the Israeli government went off without an apparent hitch.\n\n\"Remember that tonight, there is only love in this building,\" the first announcer of the night said. \"Only love.\"", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "talya_zax@forward.com", "name": "Talya Zax", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawker Hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malm\u00f6_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malm\u00f6 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malta"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malta"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151640957.jpg?_t=1715290558", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 493, "textEnd": 499}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

There's all the lights, fireworks, flags, sequins, disco balls and dance breaks, of course - but there's also the songs themselves, which this year boast displays of (vocal) gymnastics more impressive than anything you'll see flipping across a mat in Paris this summer.\n\nKnow this: 2024's brace of 26 Eurovision finalists represent what is, even for this contest, a maximalist bunch. These songs go big. I'd go so far as to say that the broadcast on Saturday (starting at 3:00 p.m. ET on Peacock) is shaping up to qualify as Peak Eurovision, so prepare to bask in the glorious bombast of it all.\n\nMusically, expect the usual mix of pop bops, baroque ballads and club bangers. Also, as always, stirring anthems about (pick one or more) standing up or holding up or looking up or not giving up. But in terms of vibe? This year's roster teems with performers positioning themselves as quirky/witchy iconoclasts. You know the sort: bold, irrepressible individuals who reject the (checks notes) conformist RULES of (checks notes again) SOCIETY.\n\nThe welcome presence of such gleefully bonkers acts as Ireland's Bambie Thug, Finland's Windows95man, San Marino's MEGARA, Slovenia's Raiven and many others - including several performers highlighted below - makes it official: Eurovision 2024 is The Year of the Weirdo.\n\nFor those of us who've had to suffer through the past few years of the contest, which were overstuffed with wan, weepy young men warbling about heartbreak, I say: Bring it on, ya joyous freaks.\n\nAnd, though Eurovision organizers see the event as \"non-political,\" it has been, as in the past, a televised concert with synth beats, glitter on the floor, and geopolitical undertones. Earlier this year, artists from Finland and Iceland called for Israel to be banned from the competition outright for its military offensive in Gaza. Israel was asked to revise the lyrics to their entry in the competition this year, when an initial song seemed to refer to Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Anti-war protests are planned outside the Malmo Arena on Saturday.\n\nHere's what you need to know before Saturday's Grand Final.\n\nWe won't be diving deep into the internecine details of Eurovision voting, because they'll spend a lot of time during Saturday's broadcast explaining everything in punishing detail (which is historically a good time to refresh your drink and/or nip to the bathroom).\n\nBut, very basically: The 37 countries participating in Eurovision this year each submitted a song to compete in two semi-finals which took place earlier this week. Of those 37, 26 are competing in Saturday's Grand Final. Six sailed through easily: every year, the so-called \"Big Five\" countries - France, Spain, Germany, Italy and the U.K. - automatically qualify for the Grand Final, as they contribute the most money to the competition. Also guaranteed to advance: Whichever country won the previous year's contest, thereby hosting the competition this year. In this case: Sweden.\n\nThis year, the 20 other countries that made it to the Grand Final were entirely determined by viewers watching at home, the so-called televote. This put an interesting spin on things, because in the past, placement in the Grand Final was determined by a 50/50 combination of the televote and the votes of an international jury of music industry professionals.\n\nDoing away with the jury vote in the semifinals meant that performers who brought a lot of crowd-pleasing visual flair to their qualifying performances had a better shot than in years past. The international juries will be back for the Grand Final, however. How their historically conservative, wet-blanket sensibilities mesh with the voting public's love of shiny glittery fiery extravagance is a big part of what makes Eurovision so damn compelling and unpredictable.\n\nSo, during Saturday's Grand Final, 26 countries will perform - the 20 qualifying countries, the Big Five, and the host nation, Sweden. Each performance must adhere to the following rules:\n\nJust to underscore Rule 3: Eurovision is not and has never been a lip-syncing competition. These performers are singing live, though their instrumentation and backing vocals are pre-recorded. If on Saturday you find yourself beginning to doubt that fact, particularly for countries whose performers incorporate propulsively aerobic choreography like Georgia, Cyprus and Austria, remind yourself that you're not watching a lip-sync, you're watching tremendous breath control.\n\nThe live vocal performance is all-important. Over the years, more than a few acts have sailed into the Grand Final favored to win, only to have a hesitant, breathless or off-key vocal in the live performance destroy their chances. Stakes. Gotta love 'em!\n\nAnd as for Rule 4: Whenever a performance involves a \"band\" wailing away on their drums, guitars and/or saxophones, remind yourself you're not watching them actually shred, you're watching them mime. It's kind of cute.\n\nLast year, for the first time, viewers in the U.S. were able to vote for their favorite Eurovision performances - though those votes got pooled with other non-participating countries around the world. This year the U.S. will again have a chance to vote in the Grand Final via the Eurovision app.\n\nHere's how Saturday's Grand Final will proceed. First, the 26 countries will perform their songs. Then the audience will vote. (NOTE: Viewers in participating countries cannot vote for their own country, which at least notionally prevents the big population centers from dominating the contest.) The audience vote will be tallied. Then the jury votes will be collected over a series of glorified Zoom calls to representatives in each participating country, which will be marked by video lags and audio dropouts; this process is awkward, interminable, cringeworthy and delightful. The jury votes will be tallied, which may or may not completely supersede the televote. The winner will be announced, a trophy will be handed out, and the winner will perform the winning song again. The end.\n\nHere are the songs with the best shot to win this year's Eurovision Song Contest, as determined by me, a middle-aged queer American man who loves bops and hates ballads. Which is to say: This is a highly subjective list. If you want to know what the oddsmakers think, go here.\n\nThis goofy, peppy, earwormy bop is classic Eurovision - and that's even before you factor in its lyrics, which are essentially a love song to the European Union itself. Specifically, to the ability to galavant around the continent freely, cheaply and without a care in the world. (At the end, he also sneaks in a tribute to his late father, \"Who told me once the world has no borders.\") Basically, this song represents the catchiest, sunniest possible way to say: Eat it, Brexiters!\n\nSure it's a bunch of burly, beardy dudes dancing a TikTok-ready folk dance, playing folk instruments and, yes, throat-singing. In other words: Eurovision Bingo! But it's so much more than that: These performers radiate undeniable bear-daddy charisma, and the driving uptempo beat, paired with that plaintive, soaring vocal (\"Oooooooooh, yea-eahhhhhhhhh\") will crawl inside your medulla oblongata and set up housekeeping. The title translates to \"We (really) don't know anything about (these) drugs,\" and the Estonian lyrics read like a suspect pleading his innocence on a drug arrest: \"I don't know drugs, I know soda and cider/Couldn't tell the difference between vitamins and speed.\" \"We avoid intoxicating substances, that's something rich people do.\" Uh-huh. Suuuuure.\n\nIn many ways, \"Rim Tim Tagi Dim\" offers a sardonic counterpoint to the Netherlands' \"Europapa.\" Where that song celebrates the freedom of travel within the EU, this one laments the loss of opportunity in Eastern Europe which is causing thousands of young people to leave their homes and migrate to the West. Granted, performer Baby Lasagna puts a wink on it all (\"Bye mom, bye dad/Meow, cat, please meow back\"), all set to an insistent, Rammsteinian marching rhythm. But he finds a way to lean into the melancholy at the same time (\"There's no going back/My presence fades to black.\") It's that kind of narrative turducken - and, let's be real, a killer hook - that make this at least a Top Three contender, if not the outright winner. Croatia has never won Eurovision, so that would be a big deal.\n\n\"La Noia\" means \"The boredom,\" and Angelina Mango saturates her vocals with a fitting amount of over-it-all ennui even as the syncopated, percussive melody swirls and throbs and compels you out of your seat and onto the dance floor. (In this case, the dance floor is your living room.) Lyrically, the song's about a woman who turns to dancing and partying to deal with \"these wasted days.\" \"A crown of thorns will be the dress code for my party,\" she sings, which is a deeply Italian but weirdly emo sentiment for a song so doggedly determined to set your booty shaking. Mango's got a huge following because she's a mesmerizing performer who never breaks a sweat, even during those passages when the tempo suddenly accelerates and the lyrics start speeding by so fast they threaten to turn the song into a five-Vespa pile-up. Keep an eye on her.\n\nSlimane invests this straight-down-the-middle ballad with a searching, plaintive, torch-song quality that's more quintessentially French than a beret slathered with Camembert and stuffed in a baguette. If you go by the lyrics, the guy's kind of a pill: Urging his lover to return to Paris, promising things will be different, demanding to know if they love him, and at one point asking the most hilariously red-flaggiest of all questions, \"What do we do about my pain?\" But Slimane emotes all over the stage, and his insinuating vocals slide you right past the ick of it all. He's not a flashy performer, so the televoters might not pick up what he's putting down, but the jury is sure to give the technical skill on display here the love it deserves.\n\n\"Doomsday Blue\" is an example of my favorite Eurovision phenomenon - the underdog glow-up. When Bambie Thug's queer, witchy mix of metal and melody won them the right to compete for Ireland, there were plenty of rolled eyes, clucked tongues and shrugged shoulders. \"Too weird,\" they said. \"Too dark,\" they said. But somewhere on their way to Sweden they upped their game and have arrived at an even weirder and darker stage performance that's, well, spellbinding. The spell in question is a hex, to be sure - the singer deftly switches between summoning black magic to torment an ex-lover (\"Avada Kedavra/I speak to destroy\") and murmuring a light, sweet tune of resignation and acceptance (\"I guess you'd rather have a star than the moon/I guess I always underestimate you\"). Bambie Thug's performance in the first semifinal electrified the crowd, and it tells a story: They dance with a demon and, in so doing, gain the ability to subdue it, and defeat it. I predict the voters at home will eat this all the way up, while the jury voters will find themselves some pearls to clutch.\n\nStrictly speaking, zorra means a female fox, but as commonly deployed, it's a coarse term for a, um, free-spirited woman, or at least a woman you don't like. You know how Old Hollywood movies used to bust out the word \"vixen\" - a female fox - to describe the kind of woman played by Joan Crawford and Bette Davis? It's like that, only ruder. In this song, Nebulossa does solid work not only reclaiming the word, but luxuriating in it. Translated from the Spanish: \"I know I'm not who you want me to be (zorra, zorra) /I get it, it's driving you up the wall (zorra, zorra)/But this is just my nature (zorra, zorra)/Can't be bothered to change for you.\" Preach. In the run-up to semi-finals her vocals have proven, to put it kindly, a bit uneven, so this could go either way. The caked-up male backup dancers in thigh boots, butt-floss thongs and corsets should help smooth things over. (Confession: This song doesn't have much of a path to winning; I just like it, and the aforementioned dancers, a tremendous lot.)\n\nPop singer Jerry Heil and rapper alyona alyona come together for this song that urges faith and perseverance by invoking both Mother Theresa and the Virgin Mary. The risk when blending two such discrete musical approaches is that each will lose its singular character once combined, but that's not the case here. The two performers remain distinct, and they create a kind of two-sided musical conversation - a song that comments on itself. Ukraine always comes into the competition with a certain amount of international goodwill, but they also consistently stage their entries in ways that make indelible visual impressions on the home audience. Don't underestimate Ukraine, in Eurovision and in life.\n\nSeveral countries submitted club bangers with extended dance breaks this year. (See also: Georgia, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta.) But Austria's \"We Will Rave\" is the best of the sweaty, sexy bunch, in no small part because it's not content to serve you up just a dance break. You're not even through the first verse before the song outfits you with its own remix. No more long weeks waiting around for some DJ on Ibiza to do that heavy lifting for you - the club mix is already here, factory installed for your convenience! Also: a fake-out ending followed by a breakbeat finish? Are you kidding? Yes, it's dated - it's giving \"Night at the Roxbury\" - but it's also, not for nothing, catchy as hell. Why this song has a shot: Kaleen's a known and beloved Eurovision presence - a dazzling dancer who's fully capable of turning it all the way out in the live performance. Why that shot will probably go awry: Even if the home viewers eat this up, Eurovision's international juries have not been kind to dance music, as they are made up of music industry snobs - the very fuddiest of duddies - who wouldn't know a stone cold groove if it bit them squarely on their stone cold groove things.\n\nEurovision oddsmakers (yes, that's a thing) say this song is one of the clear favorites to win the contest this year, which makes sense, as it's the perfect distillation of ESC 2024's whole heedlessly maximalist vibe. It's got a bit of opera, a bit of (light!) rap, some drum-and-bass EDM - it's, you know, a lot. Toss in the lyrics about performer Nemo realizing their non-binary status (\"Somewhere between the 0's and 1's/That's where I found my kingdom come\") and it's gonna be tough to beat. Any song crammed with this many different styles can come off like something assembled in a lab, but Nemo brings us along with them, fluidly and effortlessly sailing through each transition. If they can pull it off live, this one's got all the earmarks of a showstopper - and a winner.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Meet Finland Eurovision entry", "body": "With performances of '90s dance classics and techno anthems, it's no surprise Windows95man had everyone on their feet dancing along.\n\nBut who exactly is Windows95man, and where might you have seen him before? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWindows95man, real name Teemu Keisteri, sees himself as an \"embodiment of the '90s, who frees a once timid family man from his everyday life\".\n\nHe is a visual artist, dance performer and DJ who first gained recognition in Finland for his paintings and prints, and he even has his own art gallery in Helsinki called Kalleria.\n\nWindows95man is representing Finland with the song No Rules!. It was written by Henri Piispanen, Jussi Roine and Teemu Keisteri.\n\nAnd you can watch his full performance below!\n\nAs for taking part in the competition, Keisteri said he is now able to share his music to a larger audience and spread a positive message.\n\nHe said (via Chronicle Live): \"In my opinion, all Finns are a bit looney-tunes deep inside, and I wanted to bring that out more. Now I can share my music with an even bigger audience, as well as spread the joyous message of No Rules!.\"\n\nFinland managed to make it to the Grand Final back in 2023 and came in second position.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest has faced significant criticism over its decision to allow Israel to compete in this year's competition in light of the current situation in Gaza and the Middle East, with some fans and members of the music industry calling for a boycott of the ceremony.\n\nNoel Curran - director general of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision - has said in a statement: \"We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the current conflict in the Middle East. We can't fail to be moved by the profound suffering of all those caught up in this terrible war.\n\n\"However, the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political music event and a competition between public service broadcasters who are members of the EBU. It is not a contest between governments.\n\n\"As a member-led organisation, our governing bodies - the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group and the Executive Board - did review the participants list for the 2024 Contest and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN met all the competition rules for this year and can participate as it has for the past 50 years.\"\n\nThe artists taking part in this year's contest have also faced backlash for not pulling out of the ceremony, including the UK's act Olly Alexander, who signed a joint statement alongside other entrants explaining they \"do not feel comfortable being silent\".\n\n\"It is important to us to stand in solidarity with the oppressed and communicate our heartfelt wish for peace, an immediate and lasting ceasefire, and the safe return of all hostages,\" the statement read. \"We stand united against all forms of hate, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"We firmly believe in the unifying power of music, enabling people to transcend differences and foster meaningful conversations and connections. We feel that it is our duty to create and uphold this space, with a strong hope that it will inspire greater compassion and empathy.\"", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katelyn_mensah@radiotimes.com", "name": "Katelyn Mensah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_gallery", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Art gallery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Techno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disc jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helsinki"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Helsinki"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Curran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noel Curran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evening Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Broadcasting Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olly Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests_and_Sweepstakes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Contests and Sweepstakes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Contests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/05/windows95man-eurovision-2024-ab956f9.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552774", "eventUri": "eng-9552774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

They won their place in Saturday's final (May 11) with a performance of 'Doomsday Blue' at Tuesday's (May 7) semi-finals.\n\nThey have been listed as in the top 10 favourites to win the competition this year, and told NME that they are hoping to \"give the best performance I can and try to connect in those three minutes to those millions of viewers\".\n\nThat being said, there has been pressure on contestants, including Thug and UK representative Olly Alexander, to boycott the event in solidarity with Palestine. In a collective statement, the two reaffirmed their pro-Palestine stance whilst announcing they would not boycott.\n\nHowever, the singer has been vocal about their support for those in Gaza, and was recently forced to change their pro-Palestine message by the competition's organisers.\n\nThe decision came after they wore body paint in Ogham script - an early Mediaeval alphabet - which translated to ceasefire and freedom, but was later revealed to have \"contravened contest rules that are designed to protect the non-political nature of the event\".\n\nSpeaking of the change, Bambie Thug said: \"It was very important for me because I'm pro-justice and pro-peace. Unfortunately, I had to change those messages today to 'crown the witch' only (which was an) order from the EBU.\"\n\nNow, they have shared an eerie cover of the classic Cranberries track 'Zombie', and reaffirmed their support for those suffering in Palestine.\n\nThe song was originally written in 1994 by Dolores O'Riordan, and was about the younger victims of a bombing in England, amid the conflict in Northern Ireland. It went on to become one of the band's most iconic tracks.\n\n\"History repeats in rhyme until we learn the lesson,\" Bambie Thug began in the caption, sharing the cover on Instagram. \"An important piece of music that needs to be remembered and is sadly still so relevant to our world today. I know many of you have varying opinions on my position at the moment but I am truly doing everything in my power that I can to support.\"\n\nIt continued: \"After my first dress rehearsal I was asked to remove both free Palestine and ceasefire in Ogham from my outfit. My delegation and I fought against this and the EBU eventually agreed to letting ceasefire remain. About an hour before my call time I was informed that they had an internal meeting and ceasefire was no longer acceptable, and if I didn't remove this I would not be allowed on stage.\n\n\"I am pro-justice and pro-peace and this will never change, I only hope with a platform I can reach more peoples ears. My heart and prayers are with the people of Palestine #eyesonrafah and to be clear being pro-Palestinian does not mean I am antisemitic, it means I am anti-war, anti-occupation, anti-oppression and anti-killing of innocent civilians and children!!\"\n\nThe caption ended: \"Everyone born into this world should have the right to a home, safety, water, food, freedom and compassion. We must continue to strive to lead with love and look past our differences and remember that under our skin we are one human race and one spirit. Wake up world it is never too late to regain your conscience and admit that change must be made in the name of love.\"\n\n\"It's a lot when I know that my heart is in the right place and when it's not my decision. I have had to take a break from social media because it is weighing on me. A lot of stuff is completely nasty and uncalled for,\" they said.\n\n\"People should be coming for the EBU and for the broadcasters, not us as artists,\" they added. \"I stand by my statement and I am completely for Palestine, and I think it's ridiculous that it's gone on for so long. I think the world is quite removed from its heart and its consciousness right now.\"\n\nThere have been a number of calls to boycott the competition from various countries. Over 1,000 Swedish artists called for Israel to be banned this year, including Robyn, Fever Ray, and First Aid Kit, whilst over 1,400 Finnish music industry professionals have signed a petition to ban the country from taking part of the contest as well.\n\nIsrael is still set to compete in the 2024 event, and contestant Eden Golan recently reflected on the boos from the audience during her semi-final dress rehearsal, stating that \"nothing will deter\" her from representing Israel at the competition.\n\nThe country made headlines recently after they stirred controversy with their entry song. Originally titled 'October Rain', the song appeared to contain references to the victims of Hamas' October 7 attacks and was barred from performance due to breaking rules on political neutrality.\n\nThough Israel originally threatened to withdraw from the competition if any changes were to be made, a call from Israeli president Isaac Herzog for \"necessary adjustments\" to ensure Israel's participation prompted their public broadcaster KAN to agree to amend the song. On March 9, Israel was confirmed to compete after changes were made to the lyrics and the song's title was changed to 'Hurricane'.\n\nEurovision organisers have confirmed that they reserve the right to remove Palestinian flags and pro-Palestinian symbols during this year's final, and have again defended their decision not to boycott Israel over the war in Gaza.\n\nAll contestants have been barred by regulations from making any political statements on stage, and fans in the audience are banned from displaying any flag outside of the countries competing in the competition.\n\nIn the first half of the semi-finals (May 7), opening act Palestinian-Swedish singer Eric Saade -- who had previously criticised the decision to ban Palestinian flags - wore a Palestinian keffiyeh around his wrist as a form of protest. This was later condemned by the EBU (via Times Of Israel).\n\nThe outlet also reported that Australian musician Fred Leone wore body paint on stage resembling a watermelon, as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nThe second wave of semi-finals will be held in Sweden tonight (May 9), with the finale taking place on Saturday (May 11).

In the rehearsal, designed for the jury and which included an audience that had paid admission, as is usual every year at this stage of the contest, there was also applause for the singer, who always continued her performance, singing her song Hurricane among dancers.\n\nA spectator raised a Palestinian flag, which was removed by the security service, as there is an express prohibition on displaying Palestinian symbols. Someone from the stands shouted: 'Free Palestine!' The organizers fear new boos and environmental tension at tonight's semi-final gala, while the day is already very complicated in the streets due to two demonstrations. The Swedish police have redoubled their security, and Danish and Norwegian agents have come as reinforcement.\n\nTens of thousands of people - the Swedish press speaks of 20,000 - are expected to attend a large pro-Palestinian demonstration against the presence of Israel this Thursday at 3 p.m. in the center of Malm\u00f6, far from the Malm\u00f6 Arena, the pavilion that houses the finery. Coaches are coming from Copenhagen. A smaller pro-Israel demonstration is planned for 6 p.m.\n\nFollowing the booing of Eden Golan at Wednesday night's dress rehearsal, Israeli public television, KAN, issued a statement: \"Eden proudly took the stage during the dress rehearsal and gave an incredible performance. They did not silence her and they will not silence us. See you tomorrow\".\n\nThe 20-year-old performer also issued a statement Wednesday night, according to The Times of Israel. \"I am proud to represent my country, especially this year. \"I am receiving support and love and I am determined to give my best performance tomorrow in the semi-final and nothing will deter me from achieving that goal!\" For security reasons, Eden Golan has spent these days practically confined in her Malm\u00f6 hotel with the Israeli delegation, leaving only for rehearsals and official appointments, and she has not gone to promotion parties.\n\nThis Thursday's semifinal begins at 9 p.m. (TVE's 1 broadcasts it live) and 15 countries will fight to advance to Saturday's final (10 must remain): Malta, Albania, Greece, Israel, Czech Republic, Austria, Denmark, Armenia, Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia and Norway.\n\nMalm\u00f6, Sweden's third city with about 360,000 inhabitants, has demographic and cultural diversity and has a significant population of Arab origin. In the first semi-final, the Swede Eric Saade - whose father was Palestinian - acted as a guest and wore a Palestinian scarf on his wrist.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nEurovision is underway this week, which means it's about time we revisited the epic film, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga - a parody of the competition's most eccentric acts and committed fandom.\n\nWith a star-studded cast including co-writer Will Ferrell who stars opposite Rachel McAdams, the movie follows Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdottir, an Icelandic pop duo determined to win over their small town and represent Iceland at the Eurovision finals.\n\nYearning for Eurovision success, the pair discover that the odds are stacked against them. No one in the small town of Husavik has any faith in the musical duo, and Lars's \"extremely handsome father\" (Pierce Brosnan) also disapproves of his son's ambitions.\n\nBut resilience is key to this story, along with a clear and genuine passion for the Eurovision Song Contest that taps into the spirit that makes it such a wonderful event.\n\nUnder the direction of Wedding Crashers' David Dobkin, the film sets Lars and Sigrit off on a musical odyssey that includes cameos from a number of real-life Eurovision legends. Topped off with a cameo from Graham Norton, who plays himself as a Eurovision commentator, the humour and heart of the film make it the perfect watch this Eurovision season.\n\nThe Story of Fire Saga was born out of Ferrell's obsession with the competition - he claimed to have been silent for three hours after watching the contest for the first time. \"I was just like, 'what is this thing', it's incredible,\" he told Screen Rant. \"The staging, the kind of costumes, the catchiness of the songs, some of the songs are actually really good.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It was from the sublime to the ridiculous and I just remember in that moment thinking 'that would be a great movie' but I thought that someone in Europe would have done it.\"\n\nThe film takes its cues from real-life moments that have unfolded across Eurovision's storied history. For example, one of the most memorable scenes sees Lars and Sigrit falling off the stage after Sigrit's scarf is caught in a giant hamster wheel on which Lars is running is a reference to Ukraine's 2014 entry.

Daragh Brophy Reports from Malm\u00f6\n\nISRAEL'S EUROVISION ACT was booed during a dress rehearsal, as tensions around the country's involvement in the competition persist.\n\nEden Golan has been accompanied by a large security presence at the contest in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, only attending essential events like rehearsals and live performances.\n\nFootage from last night shows Golan performing her song Hurricane towards the end of the bill, surrounded by a group of dancers, being met with a mixed response from the crowd.\n\nIt follows campaigns across Europe calling on the European Broadcasting Union to exclude the country from the competition due to the ongoing bombardment of Gaza.\n\nGolan was preparing for the second semi-final tonight, where she'll compete for a spot in Saturday's final.\n\nOne fan who was at the arena last night told The Journal this morning that the Golan had been met with both booing and cheering from the crowd.\n\nA small but noticeable number of people left their seats and exited the arena before the Israeli act came on, he added. They then returned in time for the last few performers of the night.\n\n\"It was definitely related to Israel - but you wouldn't necessarily notice it unless you knew they were about to come on.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother fan who was at the venue said that one man, high up in the stands, had been shouting 'Free Palestine' throughout the Israeli performance.\n\nIn a statement to Israeli media, Golan said: \"I am proud to represent my country, particularly this year.\n\n\"I am receiving support and love and I am determined to give my best performance tomorrow in the semifinal and nothing will deter me from that goal!\"\n\nThe Kan public broadcaster, the official Israeli body coordinating with the Eurovision contest, said Golan gave an \"incredible performance\" that wasn't silenced by critics.\n\n\"They did not silence her and they will not silence us. See you tomorrow.\"\n\nThere has been a sizeable police presence around Malm\u00f6 Arena all week.\n\nMost of the officers patrolling the streets around the arena are armed and there are dozens of police vans and motorbikes on standby including at least one armoured vehicle.\n\nPolice reinforcements have been called in from neighbouring Denmark and Norway. Jail cells in the city have been emptied and prisoners transferred in case of a surge in arrests.\n\nA large-scale protest is planned in Malm\u00f6 this afternoon, in a different area to where the contest is taking place.

However, this edition is being one of the most controversial to date with the participation of Israel after the war that is being experienced in the Middle East.\n\nRight now, all eyes are on the second semifinal, which will take place tonight and in which this same country will perform before the general public with special security measures for that moment. However, yesterday the jury rehearsal took place, where the audience did not hesitate to boo throughout the performance.\n\nA reaction from everyone present that will be repeated live at the next gala and that has formed a true pitched battle on social networks. The defenders and detractors of making this type of demands have wanted to make their position clear, increasing the controversy.\n\n\"I feel zero shame for Eden Golan, because if you told me that the aunt is aware of the problem, but she has only made videos and interviews taking pride in the genocide,\" stated an X (Twitter) user. Among other things, he has also pointed out that the song that Israel plays is about the same day that the first attack on Gaza was carried out.\n\nBut he is not the only one who has wanted to go along this line. Another user cannot believe that there are people willing to defend an artist who attends a festival of these characteristics with a song that \"defends her country's genocide against the Palestinians and the aggressions in other countries such as Lebanon.\"\n\nAnd there are many who point out that, \"for less\", artists have been \"cancelled\". Cancel culture is already deeply rooted in recent times. For this reason, many want this festival to be used to raise \"their voices to prevent whitening and remember Palestine.\"\n\nAn opinion that contrasts with that of all those willing to defend the artist in the face of the boos received during her performance. And the networks are divided, with many expressing that Eden Golan should not \"feel generalized hostility and threats towards her in Malm\u00f6 just because she represents Israel.\"\n\n\"Eden Golan did not bomb Gaza, the harassment is crazy, she is a 20-year-old pop singer, leave her alone,\" one of these users commented. \"How does this benefit the Palestinians or Gaza? \"It's crazy,\" he added. However, many others point out that she herself has not hesitated to take sides in favor of Israel.\n\nConflicting opinions will multiply in the second semi-final, which will take place at 9:00 p.m. tonight. Eden Golan, representing Israel, will perform at number 14, being one of the last to appear on screen.\n\nAs several journalists present at the rehearsals have pointed out, despite the boos being heard inside the venue, in the actual performances the organization has managed to neutralize them to try to prevent them from being heard on the spectators' televisions.

Malm\u00f6 has been chosen for its compact size, well-developed transport infrastructure, and strong commitment to sustainability and green initiatives, making the city an ideal location for major international events.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, Malm\u00f6 has made significant strides, especially in terms of mobility. The city has more than 560 kilometers of cycle paths, more than any other Swedish city. These paths are equipped with advanced facilities such as traffic lights that quickly turn green for approaching cyclists, and special facilities such as waste paper baskets for cyclists and bicycle pumps along the routes.\n\nPublic transport in Malm\u00f6 has also undergone impressive improvements.

Netherlands act Joost Klein, with his irreverent and silly Europapa, and Norway's Gate with the folkish Ulveham.\n\nAlso making the final was Latvia's Dons, Austria's Kaleen, Greece's Marina Satti, Estonia's 5Miinust x Puuluup, Georgia's Nutsa Buzaladze and Armenia's Ladaniva.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU), whose members approved Israeli broadcaster Kan, has taken a strong stance, as in previous years, against political messages at Eurovision and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.", "source": {"uri": "westerntelegraph.co.uk", "dataType":

Singer Eden Golan was advised by her nation's Shin Bet security agency to stay in her hotel room when not actively rehearsing or performing due to security concerns, the Sun reports. Those concerns included threats against the Israeli delegation to the contest.\n\nGolan, 20, appeared to be booed while performing the nation's submission, \"Hurricane,\" during rehearsals on Wednesday, the BBC reports. However, her song seemed to receive a warmer reception during part two of the Eurovision semifinals on Thursday.\n\nIsrael's entry in this year's contest has been controversial since before a song was even released. The controversy came following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas and the subsequent sustained military offensive by Israel's military in Gaza. Protests were expected, which led Swedish police to bring in additional support form Denmark and Norway.\n\nThe contest rejected the nation's initial submission, \"October Rain,\" which made direct reference to the Oct. 7 attacks. It later accepted a rewritten version of the song, retitled \"Hurricane\" and rewritten with more metaphorical lyrics.\n\nEurovision answered several questions about Israel's participation in an official FAQ, specifically around the nation's participation. The contest notes that it is open to all members of the European Broadcasting Union, which represents broadcasters across both Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\"The Israeli public service broadcaster has been a member of the EBU since 1957 and has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for 50 years,\" the contest notes in its FAQ. \"The Eurovision Song Contest remains a non-political event that unites audiences around the world through music.\"\n\nA former Swedish contestant, Eric Saade, broke Eurovision rules Thursday by appearing on the live broadcast wearing a keffiyeh in support of Palestinians. Fans were warned not to bring Palestinian flag into the arena where the contest is being broadcast. Ireland's contestant, Bambie Thug, told reporters that they were required to change their outfit ahead of the semifinals after initially wearing Celtic writing that spelt \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine.\"\n\nThe contest's deputy director general, Jean Philip De Tender, issued a statement last month addressing abuse and harassment of participants.\n\n\"The European Broadcasting Union acknowledges the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision Song Contest -- set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East -- has provoked,\" the statement read. \"We have all been affected by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those in Israel and in Gaza.\"\n\nLater in its statement, Tender added, \"While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest. This is unacceptable and totally unfair, given the artists have no role in this decision.\"\n\nGolan has also said before that she plans to report for Israel's mandatory military service following her participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nSwedish singer Loreen, who won last year's Eurovision, told the BBC that she understood why people were choosing to protest, but said that she thought it was \"not fair\" and \"unconstructive\" for the audience to boo Golan.\n\n\"All of us are affected by what's going on [but] we don't know what to do, because it's such a complex situation,\" Loreen said. \"Some react with aggression, some cry, some shut down. We are different in that way, so I understand where it [the protesting] comes from.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, traditionally seeks to avoid politics. However, it has often found itself in the midst of political disputes at times throughout its long history. There are dozens of countries that participate, both from Europe and beyond.\n\nYou can watch the music video for Israel and Eden Golan's song \"Hurricane\" below:\n\nJust 10 of the 16 countries who participated in Thursday's semifinals will go on to the finals this Saturday. Votes are allowed from around the world through the Eurovision app, though votes from non-Eurovision participants aren't weighted as heavily.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news",

Around 100,000 people are attending, making it a pretty big deal, and one of the scheduled performers is an Israeli singer.\n\nThat, of course, is drawing some protesters. Among them? The Doom Pixie, Greta Thunberg.\n\nEurovision fans dressed in quirky outfits, sequins and their national colours arrived for the event, while around a hundred protesters chanted \"boycott Israel\" and \"shame on you\" outside the venue before being ushered away by police.\n\nClimate activist Greta Thunberg earlier in the day joined more than 10,000 pro-Palestinian demonstrators in the centre of Malmo who object to Israel's participation in the musical contest.\n\nPolice said protests were largely calm. Nine people had been taken into custody and one person was arrested on suspicion of a serious crime against the Knife Act.\n\nIf the protests were calm, fine. Miss Pippi Longschpieling has not, we must admit, engaged in any event where there was violence, only trespassing and blocking traffic, which are crimes but at least not violent crimes. But as we've seen from American college campuses in the last few weeks, that's a narrow line that is easy to step across.\n\nMiss Thunberg, it should be noted, showed up at the protest sporting a Yassir Arafat-styled keffiyeh to give visual confirmation of her antisemitism. This is (as so often seems to be the case) a great irony, given the nature of the people she is protesting in favor of. In Gaza - or Iran, or Syria - she would not only not be allowed to speak her mind as she does so freely in Europe, but she would not be allowed to show her face or hair in public, or to leave her lodgings unless accompanied by a male relative. And let's not even get into the environmental calamity that is most of the Middle East.\n\nSpeaking of useful idiots:\n\nProtester Eric Goran said in the past he would usually watch Eurovision, which is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and has been held since 1956.\n\n\"This year I lost all respect for the EBU,\" he said. \"It's clear that they can't take a standpoint against what's going on. I think the only right thing to do is to boycott Israel.\"\n\nSwedish authorities have heightened security, bracing for possible unrest.\n\nPreviously on RedState: WATCH: Craziness Erupts as Man Tries to Stop Greta Thunberg Turning Climate Demo Into Anti-Israel Rally\n\nWATCH: Greta Thunberg Takes the Mask Off Fully, as She Chants to 'Crush Zionism' at Disturbing Rally\n\nThe Israeli singer, Eden Golan, will be performing the song \"Hurricane.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has openly praised Miss Golan for participating in the Eurovision competition, but her experience in Malmo has been less than enjoyable; she has been unable to leave her hotel room for fear of attack.\n\nThunberg's protesting the Eurovision Song Contest is a clear illustration of the weakness of the Doom Pixie's thought processes. It's highly probable that, if asked, she could not describe the history of Israel, from Roman times to date, the etymology of the term \"Palestinian,\" or the religious and ethnic origins of the people living in what was once Judea and is now Israel.\n\nBut then, those on the left have never been likely to let facts get in the way of a good protest.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com",

However, there seemingly was the sound of boos from the audience as she made it through, alongside nine other countries. Armenia, Austria, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland all made it through whilst Albania, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Malta and San Marino all missed out on a final place, with the finalists now revealed after the first semi-final earlier this week.\n\nToday, Eurovision fans believe Rylan Clark 'snubbed' Israel's Eden. Whilst he interviewed a number of contestants while posing as a bell boy in the hotel lift, Eden reportedly did not have that opportunity. In the footage of Eden's interview, a voice can be heard asking the singer questions as she stepped into the elevator alone.\n\nEden Golan performing Hurricane for Israel\n\nGiving their theories, one fan wrote: \"Not @Rylan refusing to do Eden Golan's elevator interview. We Stan this.\" Rylan has defended the Contest amid the protests. He told Good Morning Britain: \"Malm\u00f6 is doing an amazing job of hosting. It's a song contest, it's all about the music and that's what we're here for,\" whilst co-host Scott Mills added: \"It does feel a little different, but it's about the music and the joy that we have every single year at Eurovision.\"\n\nGreta Thunberg was at the Contest today, where she joined pro-Palestine protests against Israel's Eurovision entry. At the demonstrations in Malmo, Rory Flynn, 27, from Kildare and a member of the Eurovision Irish fan club, expressed his concerns to PA news agency about Israel's participation overshadowing the event. He stated: \"We feel that it's important to make our voices heard in the competition in the arena. Others are doing a full boycott and full respect to people who are doing a full boycott but we think it's important that our voices are heard in the arena and around Malmo.\"\n\n*Follow Mirror Celebs

But this year, amid growing protests against the war in Gaza, politics are taking center stage.\n\nIsrael's entry, \"Hurricane,\" performed by 20-year-old Eden Golan, received boos and shouts of \"Free Palestine\" from the audience. The song was initially titled \"October Rain\" in reference to the Oct. 7 attack, but that ran afoul of the contest's rules against politicized lyrics and both the name and some of the lyrics had to be changed.\n\nGolan has a connection to two global conflicts. Until the Ukraine War broke out, she was a pop singer in Russia. Her father served as chairman of the board of directors at Sovcombank, one of Russia's 13 \"systemically important\" credit institutions that later became the subject of international sanctions.

Singer Eden Golan was advised by her nation's Shin Bet security agency to stay in her hotel room when not actively rehearsing or performing due to security concerns, the Sun reports. Those concerns included threats against the Israeli delegation to the contest.\n\nGolan, 20, appeared to be booed while performing the nation's submission, \"Hurricane,\" during rehearsals on Wednesday, the BBC reports. However, her song seemed to receive a warmer reception during part two of the Eurovision semifinals on Thursday.\n\nIsrael's entry in this year's contest has been controversial since before a song was even released. The controversy came following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas and the subsequent sustained military offensive by Israel's military in Gaza. Protests were expected, which led Swedish police to bring in additional support form Denmark and Norway.\n\nThe contest rejected the nation's initial submission, \"October Rain,\" which made direct reference to the Oct. 7 attacks. It later accepted a rewritten version of the song, retitled \"Hurricane\" and rewritten with more metaphorical lyrics.\n\nEurovision answered several questions about Israel's participation in an official FAQ, specifically around the nation's participation. The contest notes that it is open to all members of the European Broadcasting Union, which represents broadcasters across both Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\"The Israeli public service broadcaster has been a member of the EBU since 1957 and has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for 50 years,\" the contest notes in its FAQ. \"The Eurovision Song Contest remains a non-political event that unites audiences around the world through music.\"\n\nA former Swedish contestant, Eric Saade, broke Eurovision rules Thursday by appearing on the live broadcast wearing a keffiyeh in support of Palestinians. Fans were warned not to bring Palestinian flag into the arena where the contest is being broadcast. Ireland's contestant, Bambie Thug, told reporters that they were required to change their outfit ahead of the semifinals after initially wearing Celtic writing that spelt \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine.\"\n\nThe contest's deputy director general, Jean Philip De Tender, issued a statement last month addressing abuse and harassment of participants.\n\n\"The European Broadcasting Union acknowledges the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision Song Contest -- set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East -- has provoked,\" the statement read. \"We have all been affected by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those in Israel and in Gaza.\"\n\nLater in its statement, Tender added, \"While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest. This is unacceptable and totally unfair, given the artists have no role in this decision.\"\n\nGolan has also said before that she plans to report for Israel's mandatory military service following her participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nSwedish singer Loreen, who won last year's Eurovision, told the BBC that she understood why people were choosing to protest, but said that she thought it was \"not fair\" and \"unconstructive\" for the audience to boo Golan.\n\n\"All of us are affected by what's going on [but] we don't know what to do, because it's such a complex situation,\" Loreen said. \"Some react with aggression, some cry, some shut down. We are different in that way, so I understand where it [the protesting] comes from.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, traditionally seeks to avoid politics. However, it has often found itself in the midst of political disputes at times throughout its long history. There are dozens of countries that participate, both from Europe and beyond.\n\nYou can watch the music video for Israel and Eden Golan's song \"Hurricane\" below:\n\nJust 10 of the 16 countries who participated in Thursday's semifinals will go on to the finals this Saturday. Votes are allowed from around the world through the Eurovision app, though votes from non-Eurovision participants aren't weighted as heavily.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Singer Eden Golan was advised by her nation's Shin Bet security agency to stay in her hotel room when not actively rehearsing or performing due to security concerns, the Sun reports. Those concerns included threats against the Israeli delegation to the contest.\n\nGolan, 20, appeared to be booed while performing the nation's submission, \"Hurricane,\" during rehearsals on Wednesday, the BBC reports. However, her song seemed to receive a warmer reception during part two of the Eurovision semifinals on Thursday.\n\nIsrael's entry in this year's contest has been controversial since before a song was even released. The controversy came following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas and the subsequent sustained military offensive by Israel's military in Gaza. Protests were expected, which led Swedish police to bring in additional support form Denmark and Norway.\n\nThe contest rejected the nation's initial submission, \"October Rain,\" which made direct reference to the Oct. 7 attacks. It later accepted a rewritten version of the song, retitled \"Hurricane\" and rewritten with more metaphorical lyrics.\n\nEurovision answered several questions about Israel's participation in an official FAQ, specifically around the nation's participation. The contest notes that it is open to all members of the European Broadcasting Union, which represents broadcasters across both Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\"The Israeli public service broadcaster has been a member of the EBU since 1957 and has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for 50 years,\" the contest notes in its FAQ. \"The Eurovision Song Contest remains a non-political event that unites audiences around the world through music.\"\n\nA former Swedish contestant, Eric Saade, broke Eurovision rules Thursday by appearing on the live broadcast wearing a keffiyeh in support of Palestinians. Fans were warned not to bring Palestinian flag into the arena where the contest is being broadcast. Ireland's contestant, Bambie Thug, told reporters that they were required to change their outfit ahead of the semifinals after initially wearing Celtic writing that spelt \"ceasefire\" and \"freedom for Palestine.\"\n\nThe contest's deputy director general, Jean Philip De Tender, issued a statement last month addressing abuse and harassment of participants.\n\n\"The European Broadcasting Union acknowledges the depth of feeling and the strong opinions that this year's Eurovision Song Contest -- set against the backdrop of a terrible war in the Middle East -- has provoked,\" the statement read. \"We have all been affected by the images, stories and the unquestionable pain suffered by those in Israel and in Gaza.\"\n\nLater in its statement, Tender added, \"While we strongly support freedom of speech and the right to express opinions in a democratic society, we firmly oppose any form of online abuse, hate speech, or harassment directed at our artists or any individuals associated with the contest. This is unacceptable and totally unfair, given the artists have no role in this decision.\"\n\nGolan has also said before that she plans to report for Israel's mandatory military service following her participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nSwedish singer Loreen, who won last year's Eurovision, told the BBC that she understood why people were choosing to protest, but said that she thought it was \"not fair\" and \"unconstructive\" for the audience to boo Golan.\n\n\"All of us are affected by what's going on [but] we don't know what to do, because it's such a complex situation,\" Loreen said. \"Some react with aggression, some cry, some shut down. We are different in that way, so I understand where it [the protesting] comes from.\"\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, traditionally seeks to avoid politics. However, it has often found itself in the midst of political disputes at times throughout its long history. There are dozens of countries that participate, both from Europe and beyond.\n\nYou can watch the music video for Israel and Eden Golan's song \"Hurricane\" below:\n\nJust 10 of the 16 countries who participated in Thursday's semifinals will go on to the finals this Saturday.

and flags and symbols from non-competing countries.\n\nDespite the position, Tuesday's first semi-final saw former Swedish contestant and opening act Eric Saade wear a keffiyeh pattern material, commonly used by people who want to show they are pro-Palestinian, on his arm.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They have been calling for other countries to boycott the contest over Israel's offensive in Gaza following Hamas's 7 October attack.\n\nPolice estimated that between 10,000 and 12,000 people took part in today's demonstration, which saw Palestinian flags being waved through the historic Stortorget square. Among those in the crowd was the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\n\nIsrael's Eurovision entry, Eden Golan, was booed during a dress rehearsal on Wednesday. She was met with chants of \"Free Palestine\" and jeers by some members of the crowd.\n\nThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has allowed Israel to enter this year's song contest, despite the country's ongoing attacks on Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll is believed to have reached 34,000 people.\n\nGolan, 20, has told ITV News that she could not have asked \"for a better year to be representing my country\". Ahead of the protests, BBC presenter Rylan Clark came to the defence of Eurovision.\n\nSpeaking from Malm\u00f6, Clark, who is hosting the BBC's coverage alongside Graham Norton and Scott Mills, told ITV's Good Morning Britain that the city is doing \"an amazing job of hosting\".\n\n\"The climate in the world at the minute isn't great and you know we're not silly to not understand that there's a lot going on in the world, but I think in the Eurovision bubble it's a song contest, it's all about the music and that's what we're here for,\" said the 35-year-old.\n\n\"The city has done an amazing job, there's a lot of demonstrations happening and people have got the right to do that, but it's just about the music.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

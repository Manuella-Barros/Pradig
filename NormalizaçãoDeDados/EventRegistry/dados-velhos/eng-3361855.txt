That the Patriots will be practicing against an opponent they'll face in just over a month doesn't concern them in the least.\n\nThat's because the two perennial playoff participants are already eminently familiar with one another.\n\nThey've met three times in the last two seasons and numerous members of Houston's coaching staff were previously employed in New England. They include head coach Bill O'Brien, assistant head coach Romeo Crennel, defensive coordinator Mike Vrabel and special-teams coordinator Larry Izzo.\n\n\"Honest to God, Bill and Mike probably know our calls as well as we know them, and I'm sure we know a lot of the ones that they use because they're the same ones that we use,\" Pats coach Bill Belichick said on Monday. \"But I don't think that really is -- I mean, that's so overrated in my opinion, not in everybody else's, but in mine.\"\n\n\"I'm just trying to get our team better this week. That's what we're going to go down there and do. The rest of it, I say, is like way less than one percent in my mind.\"\n\nBelichick mentioned seeing improvement in fundamentals, awareness and learning to play together as among the main objectives this time of the year.\n\n\"This is about us trying to get better, them trying to get better,\" he said. \"And when we play each other in the regular season, then we'll game plan and we'll strategize and we'll do everything we can do to try to win the game. They'll do the same thing.\"\n\nAnd it just may be Belichick isn't worried about allowing the Texans such close access with a regular-season game looming because he's 8-1 all-time against them. That includes a 3-0 mark against O'Brien by a cumulative score of 88-22.\n\nAdam Butler impresses\n\nAlthough it's not unusual to see a rookie play with the starters, it is unusual to see an undrafted free agent move up to that first team so quickly.\n\nBut that has happened this summer. Two undrafted free agents -- Harvey Langi and Adam Butler -- have gotten a ton of playing time with the defensive starters. Langi was the team's highest-paid undrafted free agent, so his rise is less surprising than that of Butler.\n\nAfter 13 training camp practices, Butler, a defensive tackle out of Vanderbilt, has made a solid case to stick with the team.\n\n\"It's nice to work hard and have some sense of it paying off to some extent,\" Butler said of playing with the starters. \"It doesn't mean anything. You have to go out and perform either way regardless of whether you're a starter or backup or whatever. But it's a humbling experience.\"\n\nButler started his career in college as an offensive linemen before moving to the defensive line, where he played both on the edge and inside. With the Patriots, he has continued to work on the D-line, often next to starter Malcom Brown.\n\nHis rise this summer, although a bit surprising, makes sense when you hear about his background. At Vanderbilt, Butler was coached by C.J. Ah You, who happened to be coached by Patriots defensive line coach Brendan Daley when the two were with the St. Louis Rams. The connection there gave Butler some familiarity with the Patriots defense.\n\nThe connection was also the reason why Butler chose to sign with the Patriots after the draft.\n\n\"I had a couple [of teams interested] but as soon as the Patriots talked to me, I pretty much bought into it because my D-line coach C.J. Ah You knew [Daley],\" Butler said. \"Coach Daley actually coached him with the Rams. Everything they do here is the same thing that we did at Vanderbilt as far as techniques go and things like that. I felt like it was a great fit from me right from the get-go.\"\n\nButler got the start for the Patriots in their first preseason game last week and played 42 percent of the defensive snaps.\n\nCamp notes\n\nBefore the team left for West Virginia, the Pats held a slower-paced open practice at Gillette Stadium on Monday.\n\nPlayers were in shells as the offense ran several high-tempo 11-on-11 drills. Although Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo had their way early, it was the defense that finished on a high note. Practice ended with the team working on red-zone drills.\n\nOn offense, Malcolm Mitchell and James O'Shaughnessy both returned from injuries. O'Shaughnessy missed the last six practices. This was Mitchell's first practice of training camp.\n\nOn the defensive side, Alan Branch returned, coming off the physically unable to perform list. That leaves Dont'a Hightower on the PUP and Andrew Jelks on the non-football injury list. Absent on Monday was Matthew Slater, Brandon King, Tony Garcia and Matt Lengel.\n\nDeatrich Wise didn't participate after suffering a concussion against Jacksonville. He was in sweats along with newly signed Keionta Davis. Also not participating were Nate Solder, Mike Gillislee and Shea McClellin. Damarius Travis and Cody Hollister were in red noncontact jerseys.\n\nOverall, Brady finished 16 of 22 in 11-on-11s, connecting with a laundry list of offensive starters. Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski led the group with four catches each followed by Brandin Cooks (three), Chris Hogan (two), Dwayne Allen, James White and Mitchell. Mitchell made an outstanding grab, splitting Stephon Gilmore and Devin McCourty on a Brady deep ball.\n\nGaroppolo finished 8-for-15 in 11-on-11s. He connected with O'Shaughnessy (two), Danny Amendola (two), Brandon Bolden, Sam Cotton, Austin Carr and White. Jacoby Brissett received limited reps and went 1-for-2 with a pass to Amendola.\n\nPatrick Chung, Jonathan Jones and Gilmore each had a pass deflection. Gronkowski, Cotton and Carr each had a drop.", "id": "9222608", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Familiarity with Texans not a concern for Patriots", "image":

Overall, Brady was 16-of-24, Garoppolo went 8-of-15 and third-stringer Jacoby Brissett was just 1-of-2.\n\nThe Patriots will travel to West Virginia on Monday afternoon for two joint practices with the Houston Texans, leading up to Saturday's preseason game.

Gilmore's breakup was over wide receiver Brandin Cooks on a target from Brady.Wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell caught a deep pass over Gilmore on Brady's next throw.\n\n-- Tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Sam Cotton suffered drops Monday morning. Gronkowski's drop came one rep after Chung broke up a pass from Garoppolo intended for the big tight end.\n\n-- Defensive linemen Malcom Brown and Trey Flowers both ran laps after an 11-on-11 set.\n\n-- Mitchell and wide receiver Danny Amendola saw an increased workload Monday. Mitchell caught the one catch over Gilmore, while Amendola had three receptions.\n\n-- Rookie defensive ends Deatrich Wise and Keionta Davis were present for practice but were wearing sweats and not participating.

On Sept. 2, the NFL will have a monster cutdown day, as all teams will go from 90 to 53 players on their roster - a change this year after the league decided to do away with a roster cut to 75 in the middle of August. This leaves plenty of time for some undrafted and bubble players to make the team.\n\nTrimming down to 53 players won't be easy, but here's a look at what the Patriots could do:\n\nQuarterback: Tom Brady, Jimmy Garoppolo, Jacoby Brissett.\n\nTom Brady still looks like Tom Brady. Jimmy Garoppolo, in the first preseason game, looked like an NFL starter. There's no denying the Patriots have great depth here. However, Brady is 40 and Garoppolo is in a contract year. Both variables make it important that the Patriots keep someone like Brissett around.\n\nRunning back: Dion Lewis, Mike Gillislee, James White, Rex Burkhead, Brandon Bolden, James Develin.\n\nThe Patriots have great depth here, too. Lewis, Gillislee, White and Burkhead could see ample playing time this season. The biggest question mark is Bolden. He's a core special team player and continued to see first-team reps this summer. Players, including Brady, laud Bolden for being a great teammate. He may stick around.\n\nWide receiver: Brandin Cooks, Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell, Danny Amendola.\n\nThe Patriots are loaded here, which is why it'll be tough to squeeze someone like Austin Carr or Devin Lucien on the roster. Cooks, Edelman and Hogan look healthy while the Patriots have taken their time with Mitchell and Amendola. If any receiver can't start the season, it would open the door for a younger player.\n\nTight end: Rob Gronkowski, Dwayne Allen, James O'Shaughnessy.\n\nThe Patriots are set with Gronkowski and Allen. Gronk is healthy and Allen seems to be fitting in well. One of the biggest position battles is for the third spot. Jacob Hollister looked great against Jacksonville, but the edge goes to O'Shaughnessy, an athletic core-special teamer from Kansas City.\n\nOffensive line: Nate Solder, Joe Thuney, David Andrews, Shaq Mason, Marcus Cannon, Ted Karras, LaAdrian Waddle, Tony Garcia.\n\nThere shouldn't be any surprises with who starts. Picking the backups, however, creates some interesting possibilities. Karras looks like the main interior backup. Unless Garcia can't start the season (the third rounder is injured right now), he'll be on the 53-man roster. That could leave one spot for Waddle or Cam Fleming. With Solder out with an injury, Waddle has been with the starters.\n\nDefensive end: Trey Flowers, Deatrich Wise, Derek Rivers, Kony Ealy.\n\nThe Patriots have a hole to fill after Rob Ninkovich's retirement. The loss of the veteran creates a spot for Ealy, who had an up-and-down offseason. Flowers will lead the group. Wise has impressed this summer. Rivers is raw, but intriguing.\n\nDefensive tackle: Malcom Brown, Alan Branch, Lawrence Guy, Vincent Valentine.\n\nThe Patriots aren't cutting any of these players. Branch was the best defensive tackle on the team a year ago. It will be tough to cut undrafted rookie Adam Butler.\n\nLinebacker: Dont'a Hightower, Shea McClellin, Kyle Van Noy, David Harris, Elandon Roberts, Harvey Langi.\n\nHightower is still on the PUP list. At 33, Harris looks like he has some tread left on his tires. Roberts hits like a diesel truck, but has been inconsistent this summer. Langi, an undrafted rookie, has played with the first-team defense almost all of camp. He's played on the edge and linebacker. Expect him to make the team.\n\nCornerback: Malcolm Butler, Stephon Gilmore, Eric Rowe, Jonathan Jones, Cyrus Jones.\n\nWith Butler, Gilmore and Rowe, the Patriots are ready to take on the NFL's best offenses this season. Butler and Gilmore look great. Rowe continues to make strides. Jonathan Jones was the No. 4 cornerback last season and has been playing in the slot this summer. Cyrus Jones hasn't looked great at corner, but will likely stick thanks to his contract (over $1 million guaranteed) and potential special team value (if he can hold on to the ball).\n\nSafety: Devin McCourty, Patrick Chung, Duron Harmon, Nate Ebner.\n\nMcCourty, Chung and Harmon played a ton last season. The three are so talented that they can all play on the field at the same time in a bigger nickel defense. There was no room for Jordan Richards last season. He hasn't shown a lot of improvement. Ebner has had a quietly good camp and has come away with his fair share of interceptions.\n\nSpecial teams: Stephen Gostkowski, Ryan Allen, Joe Cardona, Matthew Slater, Brandon King.\n\nNo surprises here. The core is intact. The biggest question mark is Slater, who is reportedly out with a hamstring injury. If he begins the season on injured reserve, it'll create another roster spot.", "id": "9596091", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Patriots must make some difficult roster decisions", "image": "http://www.patriotledger.com/storyimage/WL/20170816/SPORTS/170817791/AR/0/AR-170817791.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 71, "date": "2017-09-02", "amb": false, "textEnd": 78}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "id": "309398", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dont'a Hightower"}, "id": "309408", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont'a_Hightower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "id": "310130", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "id": "310749", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}, "id": "312016", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brandon Bolden"}, "id": "312019", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Bolden"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "id": "312020", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Danny Amendola"}, "id": "312024", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Amendola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}, "id": "312085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "id": "325074", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jimmy Garoppolo"}, "id": "365462", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Garoppolo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Devin McCourty"}, "id": "366929", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_McCourty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}, "id": "366933", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rob Ninkovich"}, "id": "387091", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Ninkovich"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marcus Cannon"}, "id": "470394", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cannon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Solder"}, "id": "470396", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Solder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malcolm Butler (American football)"}, "id": "1275238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Butler_(American_football)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey"}], "time": "02:01:00"}

That the Patriots will be practicing against an opponent they'll face in just over a month doesn't concern them in the least.\n\nThat's because the two perennial playoff participants already are eminently familiar one another.\n\nThey've met three times in the past two seasons, and several members of Houston's coaching staff were previously employed in New England. They include coach Bill O'Brien, assistant head coach Romeo Crennel, defensive coordinator Mike Vrabel and special teams coordinator Larry Izzo.\n\n\"Honest to God, Bill and Mike probably know our calls as well as we know them, and I'm sure we know a lot of the ones that they use because they're the same ones that we use,\" coach Bill Belichick said Monday. \"But I don't think that really is -- I mean, that's so overrated in my opinion, not in everybody else's, but in mine.\"\n\n\"I'm just trying to get our team better this week. That's what we're going to go down there and do. The rest of it, I say, is like way less than 1 percent in my mind.\"\n\nBelichick mentioned seeing improvement in fundamentals, awareness and learning to play together as among the main objectives this time of the year.\n\n\"This is about us trying to get better, them trying to get better,\" he said. \"And when we play each other in the regular season, then we'll game plan, and we'll strategize, and we'll do everything we can do to try to win the game. They'll do the same thing.\"\n\nAnd it just may be Belichick isn't worried about allowing the Texans such close access with a regular-season game looming because he's 8-1 all-time against them. That includes a 3-0 mark against O'Brien by a cumulative score of 88-22.\n\nButler camp surprise\n\nAlthough it's not unusual to see a rookie play with the starters, it is unusual to see an undrafted free agent move up to that first team so quickly.\n\nBut that has happened this summer. Two undrafted free agents -- Harvey Langi and Adam Butler -- have gotten a ton of playing time with the defensive starters. Langi was the team's highest-paid undrafted free agent, so his rise is less surprising than that of Butler.\n\nAfter 13 training camp practices, the defensive tackle out of Vanderbilt has made a solid case to stick with the team.\n\n\"It's nice to work hard and have some sense of it paying off to some extent,\" Butler said of playing with the starters. \"It doesn't mean anything, you know? You have to go out and perform either way regardless of whether you're a starter or backup or whatever. But it's a humbling experience.\"\n\nButler started his career in college as an offensive linemen before moving to the defensive line, where he played both on the edge and inside. With the Patriots, Butler has received solid reps on the goal line but also next to starter Malcom Brown.\n\nHis rise this summer, although a bit surprising, makes sense when you hear about his background. At Vanderbilt, Butler was coached by C.J. Ah You, who happened to be coached by Patriots defensive line coach Brandon Daley when the two were with the St. Louis Rams. The connection there gave Butler some familiarity with the Patriots defense.\n\nThe connection was also the reason why Butler chose to sign with the Patriots after the draft.\n\n\"I had a couple (teams interested) but as soon as the Patriots talked to me, I pretty much bought into it because my d-line coach C.J. Ah You knew (Daley),\" Butler said. \"Coach Daley actually coached him with the Rams. Everything they do here is the same thing that we did at Vanderbilt as far as techniques go and things like that. I felt like it was a great fit from me right from the get go.\"\n\nButler got the start for the Patriots in their first preseason game last week and played 42 percent of the defensive snaps.\n\nTaking it easy\n\nThe Patriots took it easy in their final open training camp practice at home on Monday. Before the team left for West Virginia, the Pats held a slower paced practice to start the week.\n\nWith no pads, players were in shells as the offense ran several high-tempo 11-on-11 drills. Although Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo had their way early, it was the defense that finished on a high note. Practice ended with the team working on red zone drills. Brady and Garoppolo went a combined 0 for 8 before practice ended.\n\nNot all was bad for the offense, as Mitchell and James O'Shaughnessy practiced. O'Shaughnessy missed the past six practices. Typically, the tight end has been on the lower field with the rehabbing players. Monday marked Mitchell's first practice of training camp. He's also been dealing with an injury.\n\nOn the defensive side, Alan Branch returned, coming off the physically unable to perform list. That leaves Dont'a Hightower on the PUP and Andrew Jelks on the non-football injury list. Absent on Monday was Matthew Slater, Brandon King, Tony Garcia and Matt Lengel.\n\nDeatrich Wise didn't participate after suffering a concussion against Jacksonville. He was in sweats along with newly signed Keionta Davis. Also not participating was Nate Solder, Mike Gillislee and Shea McClellin. Damarius Travis and Cody Hollister were in red non-contact jerseys.\n\nOverall, Brady finished 16 of 22 in 11-on-11s connecting with a laundry list of offensive starters. Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski led the group with four catches each followed by Brandin Cooks (3), Chris Hogan (2), Dwayne Allen, James White and Mitchell. Mitchell made an outstanding grab, splitting Stephon Gilmore and Devin McCourty on a Brady deep ball.\n\nGaroppolo finished 8 for 15 in 11-on-11s. He connected with O'Shaughnessy (2), Danny Amendola (2), Brandon Bolden, Sam Cotton, Austin Carr and White. Jacoby Brissett received limited reps and went 1 for 2 with a pass to Amendola.\n\nPatrick Chung, Jonathan Jones and Gilmore all finished with a pass deflection. Gronkowski, Cotton and Carr all had a drop each.", "id": "9700652", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Patriots notes: Joint practices begin with familiar Texans", "image":

Since July 27, thousands turned out to watch the team practice on the fields behind Gillette Stadium.\n\nFOXBORO - The sounds of a football summer at the Patriots' complex will now give way to the sounds of relative silence.\n\nMonday's training camp practice in shorts and shells on the fields behind Gillette Stadium was the last training camp practice open to the public.\n\nWhen the Patriots return from White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., (where they'll hold joint practices with the Texans on Tuesday and Wednesday) and Houston (where they'll meet the Texans in their second preseason game of the summer on Saturday night), their practices will be closed to fans.\n\n\"You'll miss them,\" running back James White said before the team caught an afternoon flight bound for West Virginia. \"It'll be kind of silent out there once they're gone, but they'll be out there on game day.\"\n\nThe thousands of fans who turned out to watch the team practice since July 27 left an impression on fellow running back Rex Burkhead, the former Cincinnati Bengal who signed with the Patriots as an unrestricted free agent in March.\n\n\"It's unbelievable,\" said Burkhead. \"It just shows you the following and the fan support and how serious they take it. It's unbelievable, honestly, the first day I came out here seeing all the people here. It's neat and ... it's very special and I don't think you get this with many other NFL teams.\"\n\nThe Patriots' joint practices with Houston will be conducted at The Texans' training camp, The Greenbrier.\n\nThe Pats are scheduled to fly to Houston on Thursday and will hold walkthroughs there on both that day and Friday prior to Saturday's game at 8 p.m.\n\n\"Definitely looking forward to it,\" said Burkhead. \"Houston's a great team, great defense, so it's a great challenge for us to see some new looks and schemes and go against them in practice for a few days. So definitely looking forward to the challenge and getting better as a unit.\"\n\nMeet the new guy: A latecomer on the scene - signed as a rookie free agent on Friday - defensive end Keionta Davis spent the majority of practice doing conditioning work on the lower field.\n\nA two-time All-American at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, the 6-foot-4, 260-pound Davis finished his career with the Mocs with 31 sacks, second in school history, 10 1/2 coming his senior year.\n\n\"We've done quite a bit of work on him,\" said Belichick. \"I worked him out in Chattanooga myself in March. He's a good player. I don't think that he's any secret. We were able to add him to our roster. We'll just go forward with it and see how it goes.\"\n\nRoom for Davis on the 90-man roster was created with the release of rookie free agent defensive back Dwayne Thomas.\n\nIn a related matter, fourth-round draft pick Deatrich Wise Jr., whose head injury forced his departure in the second quarter of the team's 31-24 preseason-opening loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars at Gillette on Thursday night, was dressed in sweats and headed for the lower field.\n\nWise's injury in the game thinned the Patriots on the edge.\n\nAttendance sheet: Linebacker Dont'a Hightower, special teamers Matthew Slater and Brandon King, tight end Matt Lengel, and offensive tackles Tony Garcia and Andrew Jelks weren't spotted at practice.\n\nHightower is on the physically unable to perform list, while Jelks is

That leaves plenty of time for some undrafted and bubble players to make the Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots have some tough decisions to make in the coming weeks.\n\nOn Sept. 2, the NFL will have a monster cutdown day, as all teams will go from 90 to 53 players on their roster -- a change this year after the league decided to do away with a roster cut to 75 that had come in the middle of August.\n\nThis leaves plenty of time for some undrafted and bubble players to make the team.\n\nTrimming down to 53 players won't be easy, but below is a look at what the Patriots could do.\n\nQuarterback: Tom Brady, Jimmy Garoppolo, Jacoby Brissett\n\nTom Brady still looks like Tom Brady. Jimmy Garoppolo, in the first preseason game, looked like an NFL starter. There's no denying the Patriots have great depth here. However, Brady is 40 and Garoppolo is in a contract year. Both variables make it important that the Patriots keep someone like Brissett around.\n\nRunning back: Dion Lewis, Mike Gillislee, James White, Rex Burkhead, Brandon Bolden, James Develin\n\nThe Patriots have great depth here, too. Lewis, Gillislee, White, and Burkhead could see ample playing time this season. The biggest question mark is Bolden. He's a core special teams player and continued to see first-team reps this summer. Players, including Brady, laud Bolden for being a great teammate. He may stick around.\n\nWide receiver: Brandin Cooks, Julian Edelman, Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell, Danny Amendola\n\nThe Patriots are loaded here, which is why it'll be tough to squeeze someone like Austin Carr or Devin Lucien on the roster. Cooks, Edelman, and Hogan look healthy while the Patriots have taken their time with Mitchell and Amendola. If any receiver can't start the season, it would open the door for a younger player.\n\nTight end: Rob Gronkowski, Dwayne Allen, James O'Shaughnessy\n\nThe Patriots are set with Gronkowski and Allen. Gronk is healthy and Allen seems to be fitting in well. One of the biggest position battles is for the third spot. Jacob Hollister looked great against Jacksonville, but the edge goes to O'Shaughnessy, an athletic core-special teamer from Kansas City.\n\nOffensive line: Nate Solder, Joe Thuney, David Andrews, Shaq Mason, Marcus Cannon, Ted Karras, LaAdrian Waddle, Tony Garcia\n\nThere shouldn't be any surprises with who starts. Picking the backups, however, creates some interesting possibilities. Karras looks like the main interior backup. Unless Garcia can't start the season (the third rounder is injured right now), he'll be on the 53-man roster. That could leave one spot for Waddle or Cam Fleming. With Solder out with an injury, Waddle has been with the starters.\n\nDefensive end: Trey Flowers, Deatrich Wise, Derek Rivers, Kony Ealy\n\nThe Patriots have a hole to fill after Rob Ninkovich's retirement. The loss of the veteran creates a spot for Ealy, who had an up-and-down offseason. Flowers will lead the group. Wise has impressed this summer. Rivers is raw, but intriguing.\n\nDefensive tackle: Malcom Brown, Alan Branch, Lawrence Guy, Vincent Valentine\n\nThe Patriots aren't cutting any of these players. Branch was the best defensive tackle on the team a year ago. It will be tough to cut undrafted rookie Adam Butler.\n\nLinebacker: Dont'a Hightower, Shea McClellin, Kyle Van Noy, David Harris, Elandon Roberts, Harvey Langi\n\nHightower is still on the PUP list so that's worth monitoring. At 33, Harris looks like he has some tread left on his tires. Roberts hits like a diesel truck, but has been inconsistent this summer. Langi, an undrafted rookie, has played with the first-team defense almost all of camp. He's played on the edge and linebacker. Expect him to make the team.\n\nCornerback: Malcolm Butler, Stephon Gilmore, Eric Rowe, Jonathan Jones, Cyrus Jones\n\nWith Butler, Gilmore and Rowe, the Patriots are ready to take on the NFL's best offenses this season. Butler and Gilmore look great. Rowe continues to make strides. Jonathan Jones was the No. 4 cornerback last season and has been playing in the slot this summer. Cyrus Jones hasn't looked great at corner, but will likely stick thanks to his contract (over $1 million guaranteed) and potential special team value (if he can hold on to the ball).\n\nSafety: Devin McCourty, Patrick Chung, Duron Harmon, Nate Ebner\n\nMcCourty, Chung, and Harmon played a ton last season. The three are so talented that they can all play on the field at the same time in a bigger nickel defense. There was no room for Jordan Richards last season. He hasn't shown a lot of improvement. Ebner has had a quietly good camp and has come away with his fair share of interceptions.\n\nSpecial teams: Stephen Gostkowski, Ryan Allen, Joe Cardona, Matthew Slater, Brandon King\n\nNo surprises here. The core is intact. The biggest question mark is Slater, who is reportedly out with a hamstring injury. If he begins the season on injured reserve, it'll create another roster spot.\n\nMark Daniels writes for the Providence Journal of GateHouse Media.", "id": "9592569", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Predicting the Patriots' roster for opening day", "image": "http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/storyimage/WL/20170816/SPORTS/170817797/AR/0/AR-170817797.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 3, "amb": false, "textEnd": 10, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-09-02"}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "id": "309398", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dont'a Hightower"}, "id": "309408", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont'a_Hightower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "id": "310130", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "id": "310749", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Julian Edelman"}, "id": "312016", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Edelman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brandon Bolden"}, "id": "312019", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Bolden"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "id": "312020", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Danny Amendola"}, "id": "312024", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Amendola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}, "id": "312085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "id": "325074", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jimmy Garoppolo"}, "id": "365462", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Garoppolo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Devin McCourty"}, "id": "366929", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_McCourty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}, "id": "366933", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rob Ninkovich"}, "id": "387091", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Ninkovich"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marcus Cannon"}, "id": "470394", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Cannon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Solder"}, "id": "470396", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Solder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malcolm Butler (American football)"}, "id": "1275238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Butler_(American_football)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey"}], "time": "01:16:00"}

That the Patriots will be practicing against an opponent they'll face in just over a month doesn't concern them in the least.\n\nThat's because the two perennial playoff participants are already eminently familiar with one another.\n\nThey've met three times in the last two seasons and numerous members of Houston's coaching staff were previously employed in New England. They include head coach Bill O'Brien, assistant head coach Romeo Crennel, defensive coordinator Mike Vrabel and special-teams coordinator Larry Izzo.\n\n\"Honest to God, Bill and Mike probably know our calls as well as we know them, and I'm sure we know a lot of the ones that they use because they're the same ones that we use,\" Pats coach Bill Belichick said on Monday. \"But I don't think that really is -- I mean, that's so overrated in my opinion, not in everybody else's, but in mine.\"\n\n\"I'm just trying to get our team better this week. That's what we're going to go down there and do. The rest of it, I say, is like way less than one percent in my mind.\"\n\nBelichick mentioned seeing improvement in fundamentals, awareness and learning to play together as among the main objectives this time of the year.\n\n\"This is about us trying to get better, them trying to get better,\" he said. \"And when we play each other in the regular season, then we'll game plan and we'll strategize and we'll do everything we can do to try to win the game. They'll do the same thing.\"\n\nAnd it just may be Belichick isn't worried about allowing the Texans such close access with a regular-season game looming because he's 8-1 all-time against them. That includes a 3-0 mark against O'Brien by a cumulative score of 88-22.\n\nAdam Butler impresses\n\nAlthough it's not unusual to see a rookie play with the starters, it is unusual to see an undrafted free agent move up to that first team so quickly.\n\nBut that has happened this summer. Two undrafted free agents -- Harvey Langi and Adam Butler -- have gotten a ton of playing time with the defensive starters. Langi was the team's highest-paid undrafted free agent, so his rise is less surprising than that of Butler.\n\nAfter 13 training camp practices, Butler, a defensive tackle out of Vanderbilt, has made a solid case to stick with the team.\n\n\"It's nice to work hard and have some sense of it paying off to some extent,\" Butler said of playing with the starters. \"It doesn't mean anything. You have to go out and perform either way regardless of whether you're a starter or backup or whatever. But it's a humbling experience.\"\n\nButler started his career in college as an offensive linemen before moving to the defensive line, where he played both on the edge and inside. With the Patriots, he has continued to work on the D-line, often next to starter Malcom Brown.\n\nHis rise this summer, although a bit surprising, makes sense when you hear about his background. At Vanderbilt, Butler was coached by C.J. Ah You, who happened to be coached by Patriots defensive line coach Brendan Daley when the two were with the St. Louis Rams. The connection there gave Butler some familiarity with the Patriots defense.\n\nThe connection was also the reason why Butler chose to sign with the Patriots after the draft.\n\n\"I had a couple [of teams interested] but as soon as the Patriots talked to me, I pretty much bought into it because my D-line coach C.J. Ah You knew [Daley],\" Butler said. \"Coach Daley actually coached him with the Rams. Everything they do here is the same thing that we did at Vanderbilt as far as techniques go and things like that. I felt like it was a great fit from me right from the get-go.\"\n\nButler got the start for the Patriots in their first preseason game last week and played 42 percent of the defensive snaps.\n\nCamp notes\n\nBefore the team left for West Virginia, the Pats held a slower-paced open practice at Gillette Stadium on Monday.\n\nPlayers were in shells as the offense ran several high-tempo 11-on-11 drills. Although Tom Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo had their way early, it was the defense that finished on a high note. Practice ended with the team working on red-zone drills.\n\nOn offense, Malcolm Mitchell and James O'Shaughnessy both returned from injuries. O'Shaughnessy missed the last six practices. This was Mitchell's first practice of training camp.\n\nOn the defensive side, Alan Branch returned, coming off the physically unable to perform list. That leaves Dont'a Hightower on the PUP and Andrew Jelks on the non-football injury list. Absent on Monday was Matthew Slater, Brandon King, Tony Garcia and Matt Lengel.\n\nDeatrich Wise didn't participate after suffering a concussion against Jacksonville. He was in sweats along with newly signed Keionta Davis. Also not participating were Nate Solder, Mike Gillislee and Shea McClellin. Damarius Travis and Cody Hollister were in red noncontact jerseys.\n\nOverall, Brady finished 16 of 22 in 11-on-11s, connecting with a laundry list of offensive starters. Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski led the group with four catches each followed by Brandin Cooks (three), Chris Hogan (two), Dwayne Allen, James White and Mitchell. Mitchell made an outstanding grab, splitting Stephon Gilmore and Devin McCourty on a Brady deep ball.\n\nGaroppolo finished 8-for-15 in 11-on-11s. He connected with O'Shaughnessy (two), Danny Amendola (two), Brandon Bolden, Sam Cotton, Austin Carr and White. Jacoby Brissett received limited reps and went 1-for-2 with a pass to Amendola.\n\nPatrick Chung, Jonathan Jones and Gilmore each had a pass deflection. Gronkowski, Cotton and Carr each had a drop.\n\n-- Rich Garven writes for the Worcester Telegram & Gazette and Mark Daniels writes for the Providence Journal, both of GateHouse Media.", "id":

The first of the sessions - which are free and open to the public - took place yesterday at the Greenbrier Resort, where the Patriots once also held practices together with the New Orleans Saints.\n\nIn front of the biggest crowd of the Texans' 2017 training camp - most of which Patriots fans - the following happened (via our live news ticker):\n\nCornerback Eric Rowe returned to practice, while Mike Gillislee was spotted wearing a red non-contact jersey.\n\nThe absentees were as follows: Nate Solder, Matthew Slater, Antonio Garcia, Matt Lengel, Shea McClellin, Deatrich Wise Jr., Brandon King and Keionta Davis.\n\nLinebacker Dont'a Hightower remains on the PUP lis while rookie offensive tackle Andrew Jelks remains on the NFI list.\n\nCornerback Stephon Gilmore was present but did neither compete in one-on-ones nor take part in team drills.\n\nDepth offensive players LaAdrian Waddle and LeShun Daniels both failed to finish the session.\n\nGaroppolo had a streaky day: After starting the session 2 of 10, he completed 10 of his final 11 passes during two two-minute drills.\n\nJacoby Brissett also continues to be up and down. His ball placement in particular continues to be a work in progress.\n\nChris Hogan was one of the standouts during yesterday's session, consistently winning one-on-one battles and making multiple contested catches. The Tom Brady-Rob Gronkowski connection was also on display multiple times.\n\nBrandon Bolden continues to see regular snaps and running back with Mike Gillislee still absent. Rex Burkhead also was used a lot, especially in goal line situations.\n\nOverall, though, New England's offense had some issues moving the ball against a stingy Texans defense. The offensive line in particular struggled against a Houston front seven that would have had multiple sacks with other plays blown dead.\n\nStill, not all was bad along the offensive line: Marcus Cannon had a very good day, often going against star defender J.J. Watt.\n\nRookie defensive edge Derek Rivers continues his strong streak, registering a would-be sack during team drills by beating the tackle with an inside move.\n\nWith Stephon Gilmore sitting out team drills, Eric Rowe lined up as the starting cornerback opposite Malcolm Butler.

Some 19 players are squarely on the roster bubble, but can make an impression - one way or another - in the coming weeks to solidify their spot with the Patriots.\n\nPlayers who are \"locks\" needn't worry about their status between now and the opener. Players who \"should be in\" may have a bit of work left to do, players who are on the \"bubble\" have about a 50-50 shot at making the roster, and players who are \"long shots\" will really need to shine during the dog days of the preseason.\n\nHere's a look at where the Patriots' roster stands today and what could change within each position group in the weeks ahead:\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nLocks: Tom Brady, Jimmy Garoppolo\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Jacoby Brissett\n\nLong shot: None\n\nThe next several weeks are key for Brissett, one of the team's third round picks in 2016. While he no doubt has the arm strength to play in the NFL, he's had an inconsistent training camp and did nothing to stand out in the preseason game vs. Jacksonville. Bill Belichick hasn't kept three quarterbacks on the 53-man roster for a full season since 2011, but the decision on Brissett may not be made solely for 2017; Garoppolo is a free agent at season's end. The quarterback situation is something to watch well beyond final cut downs on Sept. 2. I believe Brissett can make the team, but he's far from a lock.\n\nRunning Backs\n\nLocks: James White, Mike Gillislee, Rex Burkhead\n\nShould be in: Dion Lewis, Brandon Bolden\n\nBubble: None\n\nLong shots: LeShun Daniels, Jr., D.J. Foster\n\nWe should know more about where Lewis stands within this group after Saturday's preseason game vs. Houston. Was there a reason he figured so prominently into the team's approach vs. the Jaguars last week, while some 40 other Patriots sat out the game? Bolden carried the ball five times and added two receptions vs. Jacksonville, but his status has nothing to do with what he can do on offense. Bolden, who had just one carry during the 2016 regular season, will be counted on as a core special teams player - particularly if Matthew Slater is out for any extended period of time. Also of note: the Patriots are 17-0 with Lewis in the lineup since he joined the team in 2015.\n\nFullbacks\n\nLock: James Develin\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Glenn Gronkowski\n\nLong shots: None\n\nThe Patriots don't have fullback as a position on their unofficial depth chart, but that's exactly what Develin and Gronkowski are. Develin is in many ways a prototypical battering ram of a seemingly bygone era, but he was lined up in front of LeGarrette Blount for 14 of his Patriots-record 18 touchdown runs last season. Just because Blount is gone doesn't mean the Patriots will abandon jumbo packages on the goal line. Don't be stunned if Rob's younger brother finds his way back on to the New England practice squad.\n\nTight Ends\n\nLocks: Rob Gronkowski, Dwayne Allen\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: James O'Shaugnessy, Matt Lengel, Jacob Hollister\n\nLong shot: Sam Cotton\n\nAllen looks more Alge Crumpler than, say, Marty Bennett as a compliment for Gronk; he's an excellent blocker but his hands have been a work in progress since arriving in New England this offseason. He's been much better in training camp than he was in OTA's. The role for No. 3 tight end is one of the best battles to keep an eye on as the preseason continues to unfold. All three players have an advantage in their own right: Lengel already has a full year in the Patriots' system under his belt. O'Shaugnessy comes from Kansas City with a special teams pedigree and was seen working with core players from that unit at Monday's practice. Hollister's seven catch, 116-yard performance vs. Jacksonville last week - bearing in mind it was preseason - proves he has at least some acumen as a pass catcher. Gronk isn't likely to play much, if at all, in the preseason, so chances remain for all three players on the bubble to show they have what it takes to stick.\n\nWide Receivers\n\nLocks: Julian Edelman, Brandin Cooks, Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell, Danny Amendola, Matthew Slater\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Austin Carr, Devin Lucien\n\nLong shots: Cody Hollister, K.J. Maye, Tony Washington\n\nIn reality, Carr and Lucien are closer to being long shots than even on the bubble. But consider the following: Amendola, in the final year of his contract, has played in all 16 regular season games just once for the Patriots, while Edelman has also reached the 16-game threshold just twice in his Patriots career. Both players are 31 years old. Mitchell had an encouraging rookie season for New England last year, but has been banged up during training camp. Slater, while on the roster for special teams purposes, may not be ready for the season opener. Is it impossible to see a scenario where Carr or Lucien are the beneficiary of an injury between now and cut down day? Above all else, both players - particularly Carr - have had strong training camps. Carr had an undeniable chemistry going with Garoppolo against the Jaguars in the team's preseason opener. Do not totally rule out the undrafted Northwestern product hanging around.\n\nOffensive Line\n\nLocks: Nate Solder, Joe Thuney, David Andrews, Shaq Mason, Marcus Cannon, Tony Garcia\n\nShould be in: Ted Karras\n\nBubble: Cameron Fleming, LaAdrian Waddle, Conor McDermott\n\nLong shots: Cole Croston, Jamil Douglas, Max Rich, James Ferentz, Andrew Jelks, Jason King\n\nFrom left to right, the first five locks comprise New England's starting offensive line. Garcia was a third round draft choice this April and could be the heir apparent to Solder at left tackle sooner than you think. Karras can play across the interior line, a place where the Patriots are not deep and saw Thuney struggle a bit as his rookie season wore along. Fleming, a fourth-round pick of New England in 2014, has yet to take any meaningful step forward to prove he can be a starter in the NFL. But thanks to the continuing struggles of Waddle, who got beat twice badly vs. Jacksonville, Fleming has the upper edge as a reserve tackle. McDermott, the Patriots' sixth round pick this April, should be able to essentially redshirt this season on the practice squad.\n\nDefensive Line\n\nLocks: Malcom Brown, Alan Branch, Trey Flowers, Derek Rivers, Vincent Valentine, Deatrich Wise Jr., Lawrence Guy\n\nShould be in: Kony Ealy\n\nBubble: Adam Butler, Geneo Grissom, Keionta Davis\n\nLong shots: Woodrow Hamilton, Josh Augusta, Darius Kilgo, Caleb Kidder\n\nThere's a reason Ealy, who had three sacks of Peyton Manning in Super Bowl 50 just 18 months ago, was available via trade this offseason. Stunning may not be the right word to describe the potential of Ealy not making the roster, but disappointing sure would be. While the Patriots gave up a second round pick to get Ealy, they received a third rounder back from the Carolina Panthers - a matter of just eight draft slots. Still, the guess here is that Ealy is given every shot over the next few weeks to lock down a roster spot. A player with that kind of talent seldom falls into your lap. But it's up to him. Meanwhile, Davis is worth monitoring. Initially pegged as a mid-round pick, he went undrafted in April due to a bulging disc in his neck. The practice squad is much more likely, but he's also been the lone new addition to New England's roster during training camp. Butler has looked good in camp but is likely the victim of a numbers crunch, while Grissom could certainly benefit if Ealy fails to get on the same page as the coaching staff.\n\nLinebackers\n\nLocks: Dont'a Hightower, David Harris, Shea McClellin\n\nShould be in: Kyle Van Noy, Jonathan Freeny\n\nBubble: Harvey Langi, Elandon Roberts\n\nLong shots: Brooks Ellis, Trevor Bates\n\nHightower remains on the PUP list, meaning the 33-year-old Harris has been leading the first-team defense throughout training camp. It's not a very deep unit, but Langi is arguably the biggest surprise from Foxboro thus far. The undrafted rookie out of BYU signed with the Patriots shortly after April's draft and has spent plenty of time along the edge with the first-time defense, as well as taking part in drills with core special teamers. Frankly, it would almost be a surprise if Langi didn't make the team at this point. Van Noy and Freeny would have to become completely invisible to not breakthrough to the opening day roster. Roberts, a sixth-round choice of New England in 2016, saw his snap count decrease as the postseason went along for the Patriots last winter. He played 36 snaps at linebacker vs. the Houston Texans in the AFC Divisional Round, 22 snaps vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game and just 14 snaps vs. the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. Did he hit a rookie wall, or was it something else Belichick saw?\n\nSafeties\n\nLocks: Devin McCourty, Patrick Chung, Duron Harmon, Nate Ebner\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Jordan Richards, Brandon King\n\nLong shots: Damarius Travis, Jason Thompson, David Jones\n\nQuarterback aside, the Patriots seem to have more experience at safety than any other position on the roster. McCourty, Chung, Harmon and Ebner have all been with New England for four seasons or more. If anyone can join the group, it will be King - though like Ebner, special teams are his bread and butter. Richards did not have a particularly strong game against Jacksonville last week.\n\nCornerbacks\n\nLocks: Malcolm Butler, Stephon Gilmore\n\nShould be in: Jonathan Jones, Eric Rowe\n\nBubble: Justin Coleman, Cyrus Jones\n\nLong shots: Kenny Moore II, Will Likely, D.J. Killings\n\nJonathan Jones appears to be the latest in a long line of special teams gurus for the Patriots. Rowe was a second-round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015, a team which gave up on him after just one season...which is a position Cyrus Jones just may find himself in, although Belichick has never cut a first or second-round pick before their second season (the Eagles traded Rowe rather than release him). Either Cyrus Jones, Coleman or one of the long shots will make the team - there's no way the Patriots go into the regular season with just four corners. The question is: which one? Coleman has done nothing to weaken his case in the preseason, while Cyrus Jones played a pivotal role in two negative plays against the Patriots in their game vs. the Jaguars. He allowed touchdowns of 97 and 79 yards while in coverage against players listed as backups on Jacksonville's depth chart in Keelan Cole and Dede Westbrook. Granted, he received no help from safety Jordan Richards on Westbrook's score. But the fact that Westbrook could create that much separation from Jones to begin with might say it all. The wild-card in all of this is the return game for New England. The health concerns and ages of Edelman and Amendola, players who excel at returning punts and kickoffs, are no secret. Cyrus Jones has the capability to do both; why place an extra burden on them if it's avoidable? Due to the lack of a first round pick in 2016, Cyrus Jones was the highest-drafted player by the Patriots that year at No. 60 overall. Their highest-drafted players in 2014 (Dominique Easley, No. 29), 2013 (Jamie Collins, No. 52) and 2012 (Chandler Jones, No. 21) are already gone. There are so many factors to consider when it comes to Cyrus Jones.\n\nSpecialists\n\nLocks: Kicker Stephen Gostkowski, punter Ryan Allen, long snapper Joe Cardona\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: None\n\nLong shots: None\n\nGostkowski had connected on 91 percent or more of his kicks for three straight seasons before regressing to the mean in 2016, when he was perfectly average. He finished tied for 15th out of 31 qualified kickers with an 84.4 (27 for 32) field goal percentage. Gostkowski is 33, far from ancient as far as kickers go. Belichick has made it perfectly clear he has faith in Gostkowski to turn things around by not having an extra kicker in training camp. If he gets off to a slow start in the regular season? His status will be revisited. Until then, he's your kicker.\n\nPublished at 1:44 PM EDT on Aug 16, 2017 | Updated at 9:42 PM EDT on Aug 16, 2017", "id": "9700512", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Patriots Roster

It was the second of the teams' three joint sessions and the final one open to a public that again was predominantly Patriots-friendly.\n\nHere is what happened (via our training camp news feed):\n\nThe following Patriots did not practice today: Nate Solder, Matthew Slater, Mike Gillislee, Antonio Garcia, Matt Lengel, LaAdrian Waddle, LeShun Daniels, Shea McClellin, Brandon King, Deatrich Wise Jr. and Deionta Davis. Waddle and Daniels are new additions to the list.\n\nLinebacker Dont'a Hightower remains on the PUP list while rookie offensive tackle Andrew Jelks remains on NFI.\n\nNew England suffered two injuries during the session - both to members of the team's defensive line: First, rookie Derek Rivers stayed on the ground due to an apparent knee injury sustained on kickoff coverage. While he got up and slowly walked off the practice fields, he did not return.\n\nKony Ealy, on the other hand, who appeared to have suffered a shoulder injury did come back. He sat out about half an hour of the session but ultimately was back on the field to end practice.\n\nOne day after being the best offensive skill position player on the practice fields, wide receiver Chris Hogan had another very good session. He caught a 60-yard touchdown from Tom Brady and routinely made other highly contested catches.\n\nOne day after not connecting with Brandin Cooks, Brady looked his way more often: Cooks was on the receiving end of multiple Brady passes - among them a 20-yard touchdowns during team drills.\n\nNew England's offensive line was inconsistent yesterday. Today, however, the unit had a better performance and was able to keep the quarterbacks mostly clean.\n\nMarcus Cannon, for example, had another strong showing - especially when going against All-Pro J.J. Watt. While Watt won his fair share of battles, Cannon was able to hold his ground as well. A battle on the highest level.\n\nTight end James O'Shaughnessy, who returned to practice yesterday, had a solid session.\n\nJimmy Garoppolo stayed on the field after practice to continue working with a group that included veteran wideout Danny Amendola.\n\nAfter effectively sitting out yesterday's session due to a \"coaching decision\", high-priced free agency cornerback Stephon Gilmore was back on the field - and he was once again very good in coverage.\n\nGilmore again served as the first-team option opposite Malcolm Butler. The duo was serving as the perimeter cornerbacks with Eric Rowe the primary option in the slot.\n\nWhen Kony Ealy returned to practice following his short injury timeout, he was used as part of New England's hurry-up defense. He looked effective as a pass rusher.\n\nLate in the session, the Patriots' third-team defense stopped the Texans' third-team offense thanks to a pass breakup by rookie Kenny Moore II. Consequently, Houston head coach Bill O'Brien and his team had to do push-ups.\n\nDanny Amendola, Dion Lewis and Cyrus Jones saw time as kick returners.\n\nThe Patriots and Texans will return to the practice fields tomorrow. The session - which is projected to be nothing more than a walkthrough - will be closed to the public but open to members of the media.", "id": "9700427", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Patriots training camp: 08/16 recap; Injuries dominate spirited second joint session with Texans", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJvUqhixlPSFDnJFykBkUTDoQ6g=/0x98:3000x1786/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56225729/usa_today_9824582.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "198406", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "White Sulphur Springs"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "203982", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sulphur_Springs,_West_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "White Sulphur Springs"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "id": "305436", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England"}, "id": "309397", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "id": "309398", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dont'a Hightower"}, "id": "309408", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont'a_Hightower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "id": "310130", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Physically unable to perform"}, "id": "312014", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_Unable_to_Perform"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "id": "312020", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Danny Amendola"}, "id": "312024", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Amendola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive tackle"}, "id": "321593", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Offensive_tackle"}, {"label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}, "id": "324400", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro"}, {"label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "id": "324464", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "id": "325074", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bill O'Brien (American football)"}, "id": "328990", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_O'Brien_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "J.

Every day, a new wide receiver would depart for the lower practice field to work on conditioning while recovering from a minor injury. Running back D.J. Foster was even forced to play wide receiver during a scrimmage because of the dwindling numbers.\n\nThe Patriots' wideouts, second-year pro Malcolm Mitchell among them, now have mostly healed. Rookie Cody Hollister sported a red non-contact jersey Monday, but Matthew Slater was the lone receiver not practicing in the Patriots' final day of open training camp at Gillette Stadium.\n\n\"Obviously I wasn't out there 100 percent of the time, so today was the first time I got to run around, have fun, be out there with the team,\" Mitchell said Monday.\n\nMitchell said he \"felt good\" Monday, but admitted being excluded from team drills took its toll.\n\n\"Any time you can't do something you really love it gets a little frustrating,\" Mitchell said.\n\nWide receiver Danny Amendola also took part in team drills for the first time in weeks. It's unclear whether Mitchell and Amendola, both of whom were recovering from undisclosed ailments, were on the field because the Patriots were holding the practice in shells in shorts or if they would have been healthy enough to participate even in a fully padded practice.\n\nWe'll get a better sense Tuesday when the Patriots hold joint practices against the Houston Texans. If Mitchell and Amendola are on the field, they could be good to go Saturday in the Patriots-Texans preseason matchup.

Here's what we saw . . .\n\nATTENDANCE\n\n* Matthew Slater, Nate Solder, Matt Lengel and Brandon King were not spotted for the second consecutive day. Mike Gillislee was not spotted on Tuesday, and neither were Keionta Davis, Shea McClellin, Tony Garcia, Deatrich Wise, Andrew Jelks (NFI) and Dont'a Hightower (PUP).\n\n* Patriots corner Stephon Gilmore did not take part in team drills. It's unclear as to why he was limited. He was spotted laughing and smiling with Malcolm Butler on the sidelines late in the practice, but his status moving forward obviously bears watching.\n\n* Undrafted rookie running back LeShun Daniels did not finish practice after he appeared to suffer some type of injury.\n\n* Back in full pads were Eric Rowe, Alan Branch, James O'Shaughnessy, Malcolm Mitchell and Danny Amendola. Branch returned off of PUP on Monday and took part in that day's shorts-and-shells workout. Branch, Rowe, Mitchell and Amendola all appeared to be full participants. O'Shaughnessy was not spotted working in during team drills.\n\n* In red jerseys on Tuesday were all three quarterbacks as well as Cody Hollister and Damarius Travis.\n\n* Texans defensive end Jadeveon Clowney did not participate, robbing Patriots offensive linemen of some valuable snaps against one of Houston's top pass-rushers. Texans receiver DeAndre Hopkins also sat out the session.\n\nNOTEWORTHY MOMENTS\n\n* Texans defensive linemen got ready for the day's work by playing 4-square with coaches. The best player in the group -- not to mention the guy who was trying the hardest -- was Houston defensive coordinator Mike Vrabel.\n\n* During special-teams work, with the Patriots working on their kick-return blocking, Elandon Roberts, Derek Rivers, Glenn Gronkowski, Harvey Langi, Nate Ebner all had winning reps. Brandon Bolden took a hard shot from Texans rookie Avery Williams and was put on his back, leading to a loud celebration by the Houston special-teams unit.\n\n* When the drill was flipped, Ebner was stopped cold by Williams. Jordan Richards was driven out of the play by D'Onta Foreman. Williams caught LeShun Daniels and knocked him on his back as well. Williams, an undrafted rookie from Temple, had a dominant day in the kicking-game drills.\n\n11-ON-11 NOTES\n\n* The Patriots offensive line had their hands full with the Texans front for much of the afternoon -- both in one-on-one periods and team drills. JJ Watt and Whitney Mercilus appeared to get pressure on Tom Brady on multiple occasions. Marcus Cannon and Joe Thuney appeared to be the primary culprits when Watt got into the backfield. Mercilus generated pressure while working on LaAdrian Waddle, Cameron Fleming and Rob Gronkowski. In the quarterback numbers listed below, we give credit for completions even if it appeared as though sacks would have occurred on the play. Without live contact, it's sometimes difficult to gauge what would or wouldn't have happened.\n\n* Brady completed the play of the day to Chris Hogan, a 50-yard completion down the middle of the field with both Jonathan Joseph and Kurtis Drummond in coverage. Brandin Cooks was not heard from for most of the afternoon, but Hogan stepped up as an effective down-the-field threat instead.\n\n* Mitchell looked healthy in his first fully-padded practice of the season. He was a reliable deep threat on Brady's left side, and he came down with some contested catches that resulted in him tangling with a defensive back. He had what he may consider a drop on a low throw from Jimmy Garoppolo at the end of the session, but all in all it was a strong day for him.\n\n* Langi, Lawrence Guy, Malcom Brown, Vincent Valentine and Trey Flowers started the practice up front for the Patriots in 11-on-11 work. Kyle Van Noy, David Harris, Patrick Chung, Devin McCourty, Malcolm Butler and Eric Rowe rounded out the top group. When Duron Harmon came on in the \"big nickel\" look, Valentine came off the field.\n\n* Undrafted rookie corners Kenny Moore and DJ Killings both continue to flash potential as both came up with pass breakups. Moore has been working in on the punt unit as one of its top gunners perhaps in an effort to see if he can bring them any value in the kicking game.\n\n1-ON-1 NOTES\n\n* The Patriots and Texans had a competitive set of one-on-ones focused on blocking for and defending the running game. Thuney, Fleming and Shaq Mason had a tough time with their technique against Carlos Watkins, Ufomba Kamalu and Christian Covington, respectively. LaAdrian Waddle beat Mercilus on one rep with a jarring punch, while Conor McDermott, Ted Karras and James Ferentz also recorded decisive wins.\n\n* During pass-rush one-on-ones between the Patriots defense and the Texans offense, Flowers continued to impress, flashing a spin move to beat veteran tackle Chris Clark. Kony Ealy had a pair of solid reps against Kendall Lamm and Josh Walker. Rivers showed a good speed-to-power move against Breno Giacomini but then ran himself out of one rep by trying to bend around Julien Davenport. Alan Branch got Nick Martin on a spin move, and Malcom Brown won one and lost one to Xavier Su'a-Filo.\n\n* Hogan, who had the best catch of the day in team periods, also made an impressive grab in one-on-one work. Leaping up over a defender, he fought through contact and fell hard to the turf but was able to hold on to Brady's pass. After a few days off (Monday's session in shorts-and-shells was his first on the field work since last Wednesday's walkthrough), Hogan appeared to be much fresher. He was leaned on heavily in padded practices with Mitchell, Amendola and Slater missing time recently.\n\nQUARTERBACKS IN FOCUS\n\n* Brady ended up 18-for-27 in team drills and was forced to work with pressure bearing down on him for good chunks of the day. On one rep, he tried to evade Watt, who drove Thuney back into the pocket. It appeared as though Thuney and Brady's feet got caught up, resulting in a rare moment when Brady was on his back.\n\n* Garoppolo went 12-for-21 and had difficulty finding open receivers for much of the practice. Particularly in the red zone, there were reps when Garoppolo appeared to force a pass into a spot that he might not if it were a game situation. He did complete a nice pass deep down the left sideline to Mitchell. He was also nearly picked by safety Corey Moore while attempting a shot to Austin Carr. Dwayne Allen also dropped a deep Garoppolo pass, and Garoppolo had one pass batted at the line by Carlos Watkins. During one three-play stretch of 7-on-7 work, Garoppolo threw two incompletions when he couldn't find an open receiver, and the third pass was dropped by Amendola.\n\n* Jacoby Brissett got work at the very end of the practice, when it appeared as though Texans defenders were going about half-speed.", "id": "9598614", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Postcard From Camp: Texans put pressure on Patriots", "image": "http://www.csnne.com/sites/csnne/files/2017/08/15/cp-texans-patriots-joint-practice-081517x.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "198406", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "203969", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "White Sulphur Springs"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "203982", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sulphur_Springs,_West_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "White Sulphur Springs"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "American football"}, "id": "302605", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "id": "305872", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "id": "309398", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dont'a Hightower"}, "id": "309408", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont'a_Hightower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "id": "310743", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "id": "310749", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}, "id": "311051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brandon Bolden"}, "id": "312019", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Bolden"}, {"label": {"eng": "Danny Amendola"}, "id": "312024", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Amendola"}, {"label": {"eng": "Undrafted free agent"}, "id": "312088", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent#Undrafted_free_agent"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}, "id": "321592", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Special teams"}, "id": "322846", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams"}, {"label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "id": "324224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "id": "325074", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mike Vrabel"}, "id": "328988", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Vrabel"}, {"label": {"eng": "J.

Here's the competition.\n\nFans voted 2014 as the best class in a landslide, but that only produced one player.\n\nI am absolutely, 100 percent getting ahead of myself here, but wide receiver Austin Carr, tight end Jacob Hollister, defensive tackle Adam Butler, linebacker Harvey Langi, cornerbacks Kenny Moore and D.J. Killings and even safeties Damarius Travis and Jason Thompson have had impressive moments in training camp and preseason.\n\nLangi and Butler have seen time with the first-team defense, while Hollister is very much in the running for the Patriots' No. 3 tight end role after gaining over 100 yards against the Jacksonville Jaguars while making impressive contested receptions.\n\nTHERE ARE STILL DISTINCT TIERS AT QB\n\nJimmy Garoppolo is the same degree better than Jacoby Brissett as Tom Brady is superior to Garoppolo. No one could come out of training camp thinking anything other than Brady is the No. 1 QB, Garoppolo is No. 2 and Brissett is No. 3.\n\nThis tells us two things: No. 1, next offseason will be fascinating. If Brady plays at the same level as he did in 2016, and if Garoppolo doesn't drastically improve over the next season, then the Patriots can't justify the possible decision to roll with the younger player moving forward. No. 2, the Patriots potentially have a difficult decision to make with Brissett this season. They likely will keep him because of the uncertainty still surrounding their top two quarterbacks, but as far as the 2017 season is concerned, they don't need to.\n\nIf there wasn't risk involved, they could try to slip Brissett onto the practice squad, but a team like the New York Jets or Buffalo Bills could elect to claim him just to spite the Patriots. The Patriots also could pull some funny business and find a way to get Brissett on injured reserve.\n\nNEW ADDITIONS HAVE BEEN A MIXED BAG\n\nNo, we're not overreacting, just simply stating facts.\n\nThe good: Wide receiver Brandin Cooks and Stephon Gilmore look like blue-chip players. They've been fantastic and as good as advertised. Tight end Dwayne Allen also stopped dropping passes and seems ready to be the Garth to Rob Gronkowski's Wayne.\n\nThe not-so good: Running backs Mike Gillislee and Rex Burkhead and tight end James O'Shaughnessy have been limited with injuries, and pass rusher Kony Ealy still isn't playing on the first-team defense. They all could pan out, but that's been their summer so far.\n\nLinebacker David Harris and defensive tackle Lawrence Guy look primed to play roles this season.\n\nPASS RUSH IS BIGGEST QUESTION MARK\n\nThe Patriots currently have just four healthy pure defensive ends on their roster -- Ealy, Trey Flowers, Geneo Grissom and Caleb Kidder. They also have Deatrich Wise, who's dealing with a head injury, and Keionta Davis, who was signed last week but sat out of his first practice Monday. He went undrafted because of a bulging disc in his neck.\n\nHybrid edge rushers Langi, Derek Rivers, Shea McClellin and Kyle Van Noy also could count as pass rushers, as could Butler, who's more of an interior player.\n\nThere are just a lot of questions in this role outside of Flowers, who almost certainly will start at right defensive end. The Patriots liked to put at least three pass rushers on the field last season on third down, so some players will have to stick.", "id": "9292276", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "What

It's still unclear exactly how the team will replace them.\n\nTrey Flowers is a lock to start on one side, but the other spot has been a mix of Deatrich Wise, Kony Ealy, Derek Rivers, Geneo Grissom and Caleb Kidder, with hybrid linebackers Shea McClellin and Harvey Langi and defensive tackle Adam Butler also seeing time on the edge. Pro Bowl linebacker Dont'a Hightower could be an option there moving forward, as well.\n\nWise, Rivers, McClellin and Hightower all currently are injured, however, and recently signed Keionta Davis has yet to suit up. That has complicated matters and made it difficult to project who will start opposite Flowers in Week 1.\n\nLINEBACKER\n\nOutside of Hightower, there still are no definites here.\n\nLangi has been running with the first team throughout training camp (albeit with Hightower sidelined), and McClellin, Kyle Van Noy and veteran newcomer David Harris all look like roster locks or near-locks. That could leave second-year pro Elandon Roberts -- who, like Harris, is a talented run defender but struggles in pass coverage -- on the outside looking in.\n\n28-year-old Jonathan Freeny, a favorite of head coach Bill Belichick, also remains in the mix, as do 2016 practice squadder Trevor Bates and undrafted rookie Brooks Ellis.\n\nTIGHT END\n\nRob Gronkowski is the unquestioned starter, and Dwayne Allen, who's enjoying strong summer after struggling in the spring, looks like the clear No. 2. That leaves Jacob Hollister, James O'Shaughnessy, Matt Lengel and Sam Cotton battling for the third -- and likely final -- tight end spot.\n\nHollister, an undrafted rookie, was a monster in the Patriots' preseason opener, leading the team in both catches and receiving yards. O'Shaughnessy, who was a core special teamer in Kansas City before being traded to New England on draft night, was limited with an injury last week but reportedly looked good in the Patriots' joint practices with the Houston Texans.\n\nLengel, the only holdover from last year's team, is bigger (6-foot-7, 265 pounds) but less dynamic than Hollister and O'Shaugnessy. Cotton, another undrafted rookie, has dropped too many passes this summer and has the longest odds of cracking the 53-man roster.\n\nCORNERBACK\n\nThe top four cornerback spots are all but set in stone at this point, with Malcolm Butler and Stephon Gilmore handling starting duties and Eric Rowe and Jonathan Jones coming off the bench. The fifth remains a big question mark, however.\n\nRight now, the top candidates for that spot are Cyrus Jones, Justin Coleman and undrafted rookies Kenny Moore and D.J. Killings, with fellow UDFA Will Likely lagging behind the pack.\n\nThe Patriots are giving Jones every opportunity to seize that spot. The 2016 second-round draft pick started and played every snap in last Thursday's preseason opener, remaining in the game even after he allowed two long touchdown passes. And honestly, if Jones continues to be reliable in the return game, which he has been all summer, how he plays on defense might not even matter.\n\nMoore and Killings have more upside than Coleman, who hardly saw the field in the second half of last season.\n\nSAFETY\n\nThis is a bottom-of-the-depth chart battle between Jordan Richards, Damarius Travis, Jason Thompson and David Jones, as Devin McCourty, Patrick Chung, Duron Harmon and Nate Ebner already are locked into roster spots.\n\nRichards, a 2015 second-round pick who played all of 18 defensive snaps last season, did himself no favors last Thursday with a rough performance against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He hasn't shown much since the first few days of camp.\n\nTravis started against the Jaguars and played well, and Thompson has flashed at times in practice.\n\nOFFENSIVE TACKLE\n\nCameron Fleming and LaAdrian Waddle appear to be the two players battling for New England's third tackle spot behind Nate Solder and Marcus Cannon. The loser of that battle likely will be cut, as the team surely will carry 2017 third-round draft pick Tony Garcia on the 53-man roster, as well.\n\nFleming was the swing tackle in 2016, and Waddle's effort to leapfrog him hit a snag Tuesday when he was injured in joint practice and sent home for further evaluation. The exact nature and severity of that injury remain unclear.", "id": "9736184", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Patriots Position Battles: 6 Spots Still Up For Grabs Entering Preseason Game No. 2", "image": "https://nesncom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cyrus-jones.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "id": "302611", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "id": "304975", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "id": "305436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}, "id": "306949", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "id": "309398", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dont'a Hightower"}, "id": "309408", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dont'a_Hightower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "id": "310749", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "id": "312020", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}, "id": "312085", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}, "id": "324397", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shea McClellin"}, "id": "333634", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_McClellin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}, "id": "341274", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}, "id": "357382", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick"}, {"label": {"eng": "Devin McCourty"}, "id": "366929", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_McCourty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Patrick Chung"}, "id": "366930", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Chung"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rob Gronkowski"}, "id": "366933", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Gronkowski"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jabaal Sheard"}, "id": "371026", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabaal_Sheard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Ebner"}, "id": "386992", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Ebner"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rob Ninkovich"}, "id": "387091", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Ninkovich"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kony Ealy"}, "id": "394504", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kony_Ealy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trey Flowers"}, "id": "1274551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Flowers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malcolm Butler (American football)"}, "id": "1275238", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Butler_(American_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "LaAdrian Waddle"}, "id": "1304906", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaAdrian_Waddle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Duron Harmon"}, "id": "1316872", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duron_Harmon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cameron Fleming"}, "id": "1323948", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Fleming"}, {"label": {"eng": "Deatrich Wise"}, "id": "1327194", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deatrich_Wise"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}], "time": "16:27:00"}

Bad news, though: That Patriots fatigue only will get worse in the next month and a half.\n\nThe Texans will have played the Patriots four times in one calendar year after their Week 3 regular season matchup on Sept. 24. The Patriots beat the Texans once in the regular season and again in the playoffs, of course, on the way to their Super Bowl LI win. Plus, the two teams just combined for two joint practices and will play Saturday night in Week 2 of the preseason.\n\nThe Patriots and Texans have played each other nine times overall, and Houston has won just once, when Tom Brady didn't play the entire game in the final week of the 2009 season.\n\nLet's get into this week's mailbag.\n\nWith Pats being relatively thin at DE, do you think the plan is more Hightower on the edge?\n\n-- @real_joshsmith\n\nThere's enough smoke around this idea to suggest there's fire (or Vince Wilfork is just making some tasty ribs) to the idea of Dont'a Hightower, who currently is on the physically unable to perform list, playing more on the edge.\n\nHightower has been the Patriots' most consistent and productive pass rusher since joining the team in 2012, averaging pressure on over 20 percent of pass-rush snaps. He's mostly used in a blitzing role, but he's also found success on the edge dating back to college at Alabama. It helps that the Patriots could use David Harris, Elandon Roberts, Kyle Van Noy, Shea McClellin or Harvey Langi at inside linebacker, where Hightower is projected by many to play. The truth is, Hightower always has moved around the Patriots' defense.\n\nIt seems like Langi has been used as a seat-filler for Hightower in practice, where he's receiving first-team reps at -- dun dun dun -- the edge. It certainly would make sense to use Hightower on the edge and more as a pass rusher this season after the Patriots lost Rob Ninkovich to retirement and Jabaal Sheard and Chris Long in free agency.\n\nDo you think Patriots push for a late camp trade to add needed depth on the defensive line?\n\n-- @AD_Helling54\n\nIt's certainly possible the Patriots acquire another pass rusher in a trade. It actually would be odd and out of character if the Patriots don't make at least one trade before the season begins. The Chicago Bears, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Philadelphia Eagles all look like they could have excess pass rushers.\n\nA name I picked out randomly and for no particular reason but could make sense: the Eagles' Alex McCalister.\n\n@DougKyed Who's the most likely starter at RB?\n\n-- @DwashedWADE\n\nThat's a tough question.\n\nI could cop out and say James White, because there's a good chance he'll finish the season leading his position in snaps.\n\nBut when have you ever known me to take the easy way out (other than that time I asked if I could stain my deck without cleaning it first)? I'm going to safely assume you're talking about the early-down starting back rather than the third-down position.\n\nI'll still go with Mike Gillislee, but the longer he stays out with his hamstring injury, the more likely it is either Rex Burkhead or Dion Lewis takes the majority of early-season early-down reps. Gillislee is the best fit for the early-down role, but he has to get on the practice field and in a preseason game to nail down that position.\n\nIf Wise, Rivers injuries are serious enough to miss significant time, do you see a move to 3-4 base out of necessity & avail personnel?\n\n-- @Philostopher_\n\nThe Patriots don't really play a 3-4 or a 4-3. Former Patriots linebacker Jerod Mayo described it as a 5-2 last season, which is fairly accurate. They have a right defensive end whose primary job is to rush the passer, two defensive tackles, a left defensive end who's versatile enough to drop into coverage and a linebacker standing up on the edge who can rush when the LDE drops back into coverage.\n\nThe Patriots can't really play a 3-4 like they did in the past with Ty Warren, Vince Wilfork/Ted Washington and Richard Seymour for a number of reasons. First, teams simply pass the ball too much, and three 300-pounders can't get after the passer well enough. Second, they don't have a player as talented and rare as Seymour, because they don't draft in the top 10 anymore. Seymour was big and athletic enough to play five-technique defensive end and generate consistent pressure. Malcom Brown, Alan Branch, Vincent Valentine and Lawrence Guy are better space-eaters than pass rushers, and you don't want three of those guys on the field at the same time. Space gets eaten, but quarterbacks don't.\n\nIs Austin carr the next edelman,\n\nThe next sudfeld, or somewhere in between\n\n-- @Patsnews2016\n\nThere's definitely a much better chance he's the next Zach Sudfeld, if I'm being brutally honest and realistic.\n\nEdelman might be described as gritty, deceptively fast, a grinder and all of the other cliches, but he's also an elite, rare athlete. His 20-yard shuttle was in the 97th percentile, and his 3-cone drill was in the 94th percentile. Carr hasn't shown the same type of quickness so far in camp.\n\nThe Patriots could elect to carry Carr as an extra receiver if they like him enough, but he's definitely a better player to stash on the practice squad if they can get him to clear waivers. I understand why Patriots fans are giddy about Carr. His playing style resembles Edelman, Danny Amendola, Wes Welker, Troy Brown, etc., and he made a really great catch. But let's wait three more games before we start comparing him to one of the greatest postseason wide receivers in NFL history.\n\nThat's not an exaggeration, by the way. Edelman is third in NFL history with 89 postseason receptions and 13th with 1,024 playoff receiving yards.\n\n#maildoug Oline looks shaky to me. Any chance they trade for a tackle?\n\n-- @MrQuindazzi\n\nI doubt it, but it certainly could happen.\n\nThe Patriots were willing to go all of last season with Nate Solder, Marcus Cannon, Cameron Fleming and LaAdrian Waddle as their offensive tackles. I believe they can get by with Solder, Cannon, either Fleming or Waddle and rookie Tony Garcia this season.\n\nDo you think Cyrus Jones gets cut? As a Bama fan I hope he don't, but he definitely continues to not help himself...\n\n-- @Caleb4Bama\n\nI'm not sure if they would be willing to outright cut him. A team could be willing to trade for him, though.\n\nI believe a change of scenery would be good for him. The Patriots are so good that the negative subset of fans has to key in and focus on something or someone. Some Patriots fans still think Devin McCourty, he of All-Pros, Pro Bowl selections and captaincies, stinks because he took a step back as a cornerback way back in 2011.\n\nWhat would Jones have to do at this point to convince fans he's a good player? A touchdown on every punt and kick return?\n\nLet's go rapid fire.\n\nIf Jimmy Garoppolo hits free agency after 2017, do you he'll get a bigger contract than Brock Osweiler's 4-year/$72M with $37M guaranteed?\n\n-- @mstanoisNFL\n\nAs crazy as it sounds, yes.\n\nWill Summer Doug's hair be making an appearance during the postseason?\n\n-- @PP_Rich_Hill\n\nNo, I don't think NESN wants #VacationDoug on air. That guy's a wildcard.\n\nsup? #maledoug\n\n-- @June__NYC\n\nnm, u?\n\n#maildoug Do your incredible good looks help or hurt you as a football reporter?\n\n-- @MrQuindazzi\n\nThat's a really great, insightful question. They probably hurt, if I'm being honest.\n\nWhat restaurant would you like to see on the concourse at Gillette? (Ideally, one open on Sundays.) #MailDoug #BelichickFilA\n\n-- @TeamCrazyMatt\n\nIn-N-Out Burger, maybe?\n\nPretty much anywhere else, and I'd rather eat the delicious free food in the press box.\n\nIf we're talking Patriot Place or on Route 1 North after 495, then I don't just want a Chick-Fil-A, I actively need it.\n\nWhat's your favorite podcast you've ever appeared on, and why ours?\n\n-- @rslashpatriots\n\nProbably The Bill Barnwell Show.\n\nwho wins in each of the two SummerSlam main events? #maildoug\n\n-- @JeffWIIM\n\nRoman Reigns, with help from Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose, and Nakamura.\n\nHa, just kidding. It will probably be Brock Lesnar and Jinder Mahal. Nothing fun ever happens in wrestling.\n\nBut seriously, Lesnar needs to lose the WWE Universal Championship. Why? Because Raw's roster is full of wrestlers who could be Universal champ, like Braun, Dean, Finn, Reigns, Samoa Joe and Rollins, and they have a title holder who isn't there every week And they don't have a secondary title strong enough to carry the show -- like the U.S. title could -- because they choose to have Jason Jordan feud with The Miz for the Intercontinental championship.\n\nThumbnail photo via Mark J.

Two Super Bowls in the last three years, capped by a monumental 25-point comeback in Houston in February make the question this year not if they can make the playoffs, or even if they are a Super Bowl-calibre team, the question is can anything stop them?\n\nThe 2016 season started with Tom Brady suspended for four games. Cue people predicting a struggle for New England. However, a great game and a half from Jimmy Garoppolo before getting hurt, and then an incredible game plan against the Houston Texans gave the Patriots a 3-1 record without their talisman.\n\nWhen Brady got back on the field, it felt like 2007 part II. The Patriots were in \"F-you\" mode once again and Tom Brady was the commander-in-chief of their assault on the league's defenses. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Buffalo were the first victims of a well-rested and angry Brady. A bye week and last-second loss to the Seahawks halted momentum, but they Patriots soon tore through a soft schedule in the second half to finish with an NFL-best 14-2 record and the #1 seed in the AFC.\n\nCome the playoffs they had a slight scare against the Texans hungry defense before pouring on the pain late on. They then ran through the Steelers once again before THAT comeback and a fifth Lombardi trophy.\n\nThe Patriots took one look at the 2017 Draft class and said: \"no thank you\". They traded away their first round pick for Brandin Cooks, sent their second rounder to Carolina for Kony Ealy and a third rounder, flipped a fourth for Dwayne Allen and then gave up a fifth to sign Mike Gillislee as a restricted free agent. All of that business was topped by a rare investment in the free agent market with Stephon Gilmore.\n\nThe losses are not quite as heavy. There was a lot of turnover at the edge position, where they are down basically the entire depth chart from the start of last season, however the 2.5-sack man from the Super Bowl Trey Flowers is there, and they invested their top pick, #19 in the third round, in Derek Rivers who looks like a typically solid Patriots pick.\n\nThe Patriots have a potentially tricky schedule this season. The Chiefs have an elite pass rush, the Saints have a great passing attack, and the Texans could have one of the most devastating front sevens in recent history. Carolina and Tampa are potentially dangerous as well. Then there is the rest of the AFC West to contend with. Trips to Denver rarely end well for Bill Belichick, and the Raiders game could be a fight for the #1 seed in the AFC. They also have to visit Heinz Field in mid-December which is never pleasant.\n\nWe all know about Brady and Rob Gronkowski, but who are the lesser known Patriots that you should keep an eye on this year?\n\nThis may be redundant by the time Week 1 comes around because I have a feeling Jones could be cut by then.\n\nThe second round pick in 2016, Jones was expected to come in and compete well in the league, after all he was a well-touted Alabama product. However, he has struggled in coverage since entering the league. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the first preseason game this year when he got beaten deep twice by second-string Jacksonville Jaguars receivers. The Pats have tried to get some value out of him as a punt returner but he messed that up too, continuously muffing kicks. If he does stay on the 53-man roster then he will have to improve a lot to be a productive part of this team.\n\nAnother guy who might not make the 53-man, but boy did he impress in the Patriots first preseason game against Jacksonville. This undrafted rookie out of Northwestern looked like Wes Welker reborn as he ran comebacks and drag routes for Jimmy Garoppolo, and then even caught the eye of Brady and Julian Edelman on the sideline by staying alive as Garoppolo scrambled in the red zone and extending beautifully for a three-yard touchdown catch.\n\nThere is almost no room in the Patriots wide receiver corps for Carr, with Danny Amendola, Brandin Cooks, Edelman, Malcolm Mitchell, Chris Hogan, and special teams ace Matthew Slater, however don't put it past Belichick to keep a seventh receiver, especially if he shows his worth as an Edelman-Amendola replacement.\n\nThis is a guy who is definitely making the 53, and probably going to be leaned on heavily this season. Flowers quietly led the Patriots in sacks last year with seven in the regular season despite playing just 53.9% of defensive snaps, and then played a huge part in the Super Bowl LI comeback with his late pressure on Matt Ryan.\n\nThis year Flowers will be expected to play a lot more of the snaps, especially with Rob Ninkovich now retired, and be the rock on the edge for the Patriots defense. New England have plenty of talent in their linebackers and secondary, but up front, and especially on the edge, they are a little light in impact players. If Flowers can really break out and become a high-end pass rusher then the Patriots may truly be impossible to beat.\n\nThe AFC East is all but won already. The Jets are in the tank, the Dolphins are relying on Jay Cutler, and the Bills are in Year 1 of a new regime once again. However, the #1 seed is not so secure. They have to travel to Denver, Oakland, and Pittsburgh, they have a Super Bowl rematch against the Falcons and the entire NFC South could be very good.\n\nStill, it's so hard not to pencil the Patriots into a Super Bowl LII appearance. The additional weapons around Tom Brady this season, along with the return of Rob Gronkowski, make them a fearsome offense. They re-signed Dont'a Hightower and still have Malcolm Butler. Oh, and Bill Belichick remains the greatest coach of his generation, and probably ever.\n\nIf the personnel doesn't get you, the inventiveness of the coaching staff will. On any given Sunday anyone can lose, but foreseeing the Patriots losing in January or February is harder than avoiding Game of Thrones spoilers. It's Super Bowl or nothing in Foxboro, and who am I to say they can't establish a second dynasty?", "id": "9700447", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New England Patriots: 2017 preview -

Some 19 players are squarely on the roster bubble, but can make an impression - one way or another - in the coming weeks to solidify their spot with the Patriots.\n\nPlayers who are \"locks\" needn't worry about their status between now and the opener. Players who \"should be in\" may have a bit of work left to do, players who are on the \"bubble\" have about a 50-50 shot at making the roster, and players who are \"long shots\" will really need to shine during the dog days of the preseason.\n\nHere's a look at where the Patriots' roster stands today and what could change within each position group in the weeks ahead:\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nLocks: Tom Brady, Jimmy Garoppolo\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Jacoby Brissett\n\nLong shot: None\n\nThe next several weeks are key for Brissett, one of the team's third round picks in 2016. While he no doubt has the arm strength to play in the NFL, he's had an inconsistent training camp and did nothing to stand out in the preseason game vs. Jacksonville. Bill Belichick hasn't kept three quarterbacks on the 53-man roster for a full season since 2011, but the decision on Brissett may not be made solely for 2017; Garoppolo is a free agent at season's end. The quarterback situation is something to watch well beyond final cut downs on Sept. 2. I believe Brissett can make the team, but he's far from a lock.\n\nRunning Backs\n\nLocks: James White, Mike Gillislee, Rex Burkhead\n\nShould be in: Dion Lewis, Brandon Bolden\n\nBubble: None\n\nLong shots: LeShun Daniels, Jr., D.J. Foster\n\nWe should know more about where Lewis stands within this group after Saturday's preseason game vs. Houston. Was there a reason he figured so prominently into the team's approach vs. the Jaguars last week, while some 40 other Patriots sat out the game? Bolden carried the ball five times and added two receptions vs. Jacksonville, but his status has nothing to do with what he can do on offense. Bolden, who had just one carry during the 2016 regular season, will be counted on as a core special teams player - particularly if Matthew Slater is out for any extended period of time. Also of note: the Patriots are 17-0 with Lewis in the lineup since he joined the team in 2015.\n\nFullbacks\n\nLock: James Develin\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Glenn Gronkowski\n\nLong shots: None\n\nThe Patriots don't have fullback as a position on their unofficial depth chart, but that's exactly what Develin and Gronkowski are. Develin is in many ways a prototypical battering ram of a seemingly bygone era, but he was lined up in front of LeGarrette Blount for 14 of his Patriots-record 18 touchdown runs last season. Just because Blount is gone doesn't mean the Patriots will abandon jumbo packages on the goal line. Don't be stunned if Rob's younger brother finds his way back on to the New England practice squad.\n\nTight Ends\n\nLocks: Rob Gronkowski, Dwayne Allen\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: James O'Shaugnessy, Matt Lengel, Jacob Hollister\n\nLong shot: Sam Cotton\n\nAllen looks more Alge Crumpler than, say, Marty Bennett as a compliment for Gronk; he's an excellent blocker but his hands have been a work in progress since arriving in New England this offseason. He's been much better in training camp than he was in OTA's. The role for No. 3 tight end is one of the best battles to keep an eye on as the preseason continues to unfold. All three players have an advantage in their own right: Lengel already has a full year in the Patriots' system under his belt. O'Shaugnessy comes from Kansas City with a special teams pedigree and was seen working with core players from that unit at Monday's practice. Hollister's seven catch, 116-yard performance vs. Jacksonville last week - bearing in mind it was preseason - proves he has at least some acumen as a pass catcher. Gronk isn't likely to play much, if at all, in the preseason, so chances remain for all three players on the bubble to show they have what it takes to stick.\n\nWide Receivers\n\nLocks: Julian Edelman, Brandin Cooks, Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell, Danny Amendola, Matthew Slater\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Austin Carr, Devin Lucien\n\nLong shots: Cody Hollister, K.J. Maye, Tony Washington\n\nIn reality, Carr and Lucien are closer to being long shots than even on the bubble. But consider the following: Amendola, in the final year of his contract, has played in all 16 regular season games just once for the Patriots, while Edelman has also reached the 16-game threshold just twice in his Patriots career. Both players are 31 years old. Mitchell had an encouraging rookie season for New England last year, but has been banged up during training camp. Slater, while on the roster for special teams purposes, may not be ready for the season opener. Is it impossible to see a scenario where Carr or Lucien are the beneficiary of an injury between now and cut down day? Above all else, both players - particularly Carr - have had strong training camps. Carr had an undeniable chemistry going with Garoppolo against the Jaguars in the team's preseason opener. Do not totally rule out the undrafted Northwestern product hanging around.\n\nOffensive Line\n\nLocks: Nate Solder, Joe Thuney, David Andrews, Shaq Mason, Marcus Cannon, Tony Garcia\n\nShould be in: Ted Karras\n\nBubble: Cameron Fleming, LaAdrian Waddle, Conor McDermott\n\nLong shots: Cole Croston, Jamil Douglas, Max Rich, James Ferentz, Andrew Jelks, Jason King\n\nFrom left to right, the first five locks comprise New England's starting offensive line. Garcia was a third round draft choice this April and could be the heir apparent to Solder at left tackle sooner than you think. Karras can play across the interior line, a place where the Patriots are not deep and saw Thuney struggle a bit as his rookie season wore along. Fleming, a fourth-round pick of New England in 2014, has yet to take any meaningful step forward to prove he can be a starter in the NFL. But thanks to the continuing struggles of Waddle, who got beat twice badly vs. Jacksonville, Fleming has the upper edge as a reserve tackle. McDermott, the Patriots' sixth round pick this April, should be able to essentially redshirt this season on the practice squad.\n\nDefensive Line\n\nLocks: Malcom Brown, Alan Branch, Trey Flowers, Derek Rivers, Vincent Valentine, Deatrich Wise Jr., Lawrence Guy\n\nShould be in: Kony Ealy\n\nBubble: Adam Butler, Geneo Grissom, Keionta Davis\n\nLong shots: Woodrow Hamilton, Josh Augusta, Darius Kilgo, Caleb Kidder\n\nThere's a reason Ealy, who had three sacks of Peyton Manning in Super Bowl 50 just 18 months ago, was available via trade this offseason. Stunning may not be the right word to describe the potential of Ealy not making the roster, but disappointing sure would be. While the Patriots gave up a second round pick to get Ealy, they received a third rounder back from the Carolina Panthers - a matter of just eight draft slots. Still, the guess here is that Ealy is given every shot over the next few weeks to lock down a roster spot. A player with that kind of talent seldom falls into your lap. But it's up to him. Meanwhile, Davis is worth monitoring. Initially pegged as a mid-round pick, he went undrafted in April due to a bulging disc in his neck. The practice squad is much more likely, but he's also been the lone new addition to New England's roster during training camp. Butler has looked good in camp but is likely the victim of a numbers crunch, while Grissom could certainly benefit if Ealy fails to get on the same page as the coaching staff.\n\nLinebackers\n\nLocks: Dont'a Hightower, David Harris, Shea McClellin\n\nShould be in: Kyle Van Noy, Jonathan Freeny\n\nBubble: Harvey Langi, Elandon Roberts\n\nLong shots: Brooks Ellis, Trevor Bates\n\nHightower remains on the PUP list, meaning the 33-year-old Harris has been leading the first-team defense throughout training camp. It's not a very deep unit, but Langi is arguably the biggest surprise from Foxboro thus far. The undrafted rookie out of BYU signed with the Patriots shortly after April's draft and has spent time plenty of time along the edge with the first-time defense, as well as taking part in drills with core special teamers. Frankly, it would almost be a surprise if Langi didn't make the team at this point. Van Noy and Freeny would have to become completely invisible to not breakthrough to the opening day roster. Roberts, a sixth-round choice of New England in 2016, saw his snap count decrease as the postseason went along for the Patriots last winter. He played 36 snaps at linebacker vs. the Houston Texans in the AFC Divisional Round, 22 snaps vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game and just 14 snaps vs. the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. Did he hit a rookie wall, or was it something else Belichick saw?\n\nSafeties\n\nLocks: Devin McCourty, Patrick Chung, Duron Harmon, Nate Ebner\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: Jordan Richards, Brandon King\n\nLong shots: Damarius Travis, Jason Thompson, David Jones\n\nQuarterback aside, the Patriots seem to have more experience at safety than any other position on the roster. McCourty, Chung, Harmon and Ebner have all been with New England for four seasons or more. If anyone can join the group, it will be King - though like Ebner, special teams are his bread and butter. Richards did not have a particularly strong game against Jacksonville last week.\n\nCornerbacks\n\nLocks: Malcolm Butler, Stephon Gilmore\n\nShould be in: Jonathan Jones, Eric Rowe\n\nBubble: Justin Coleman, Cyrus Jones\n\nLong shots: Kenny Moore II, Will Likely, D.J. Killings\n\nJonathan Jones appears to be the latest in a long line of special teams gurus for the Patriots. Rowe was a second-round pick of the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015, a team which gave up on him after just one season...which is a position Cyrus Jones just may find himself in, although Belichick has never cut a first or second-round pick before their second season (the Eagles traded Rowe rather than release him). Either Cyrus Jones, Coleman or one of the long shots will make the team - there's no way the Patriots go into the regular season with just four corners. The question is: which one? Coleman has done nothing to weaken his case in the preseason, while Cyrus Jones played a pivotal role in two negative plays against the Patriots in their game vs. the Jaguars. He allowed touchdowns of 97 and 79 yards while in coverage against players listed as backups on Jacksonville's depth chart in Keelan Cole and Dede Westbrook. Granted, he received no help from safety Jordan Richards on Westbrook's score. But the fact that Westbrook could create that much separation from Jones to begin with might say it all. The wild-card in all of this is the return game for New England. The health concerns and ages of Edelman and Amendola, players who excel at returning punts and kickoffs, are no secret. Cyrus Jones has the capability to do both; why place an extra burden on them if it's avoidable? Due to the lack of a first round pick in 2016, Cyrus Jones was the highest-drafted player by the Patriots that year at No. 60 overall. Their highest-drafted players in 2014 (Dominique Easley, No. 29), 2013 (Jamie Collins, No. 52) and 2012 (Chandler Jones, No. 21) are already gone. There are so many factors to consider when it comes to Cyrus Jones.\n\nSpecialists\n\nLocks: Kicker Stephen Gostkowski, punter Ryan Allen, long snapper Joe Cardona\n\nShould be in: None\n\nBubble: None\n\nLong shots: None\n\nGostkowski had connected on 91 percent or more of his kicks for three straight seasons before regressing to the mean in 2016, when he was perfectly average. He finished tied for 15th out of 31 qualified kickers with an 84.4 (27 for 32) field goal percentage. Gostkowski is 33, far from ancient as far as kickers go. Belichick has made it perfectly clear he has faith in Gostkowski to turn things around by not having an extra kicker in training camp. If he gets off to a slow start in the regular season? His status will be revisited. Until then, he's your kicker.\n\nPublished 13 minutes ago | Updated 8 minutes ago", "id": "9538756", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Patriots Roster Watch: Locks, Bubbles, and

Rivers had remained on the ground before having his left leg/knee evaluated by head athletic trainer Jim Whalen. Rivers ended up walking off on his own, but the team's plans to have him return to Boston for evaluation indicates that there is no final diagnosis on the severity of the injury.\n\nSo Rivers won't play in Saturday night's preseason game at Houston, nor will fellow rookie defensive end Deatrich Wise Jr., who sustained a head injury in Thursday's preseason opener. That leaves Trey Flowers, Geneo Grissom, Kony Ealy and undrafted Caleb Kidder as the next available players on the depth chart.\n\nAs for the big picture of things at defensive end, there is a question mark after Flowers. Rivers and Wise were always projected to be on the initial 53-man roster, but how quickly they might be able to contribute remains an unknown. Meanwhile, Grissom and Ealy have received a lot of reps in camp, and neither is viewed as a lock to make the roster. Kidder and fellow undrafted rookie Keionta Davis round out the depth chart, although Davis is not yet physically cleared to practice.\n\nWhere it all leads is one of the compelling personnel questions surrounding the Patriots, who as usual, are surely scouring the NFL landscape for possible reinforcements. The free-agent market isn't plentiful (could 37-year-old Dwight Freeney provide a boost?), but perhaps director of pro personnel Dave Ziegler can identify a trade target around the NFL similar to past years when the Patriots have added in-season reinforcements such as defensive tackle Akiem Hicks and linebackers Akeem Ayers and Jonathan Casillas.\n\nOne other aspect to consider is that the Patriots' defensive scheme is flexible, so outside linebackers could eventually be tapped to play more of an end-of-the-line role. Along those lines, undrafted Harvey Langi (BYU), who was moved to that spot early in training camp, is getting a long, hard look from coaches.\n\nBetween defensive end and depth at left tackle (starter Nate Solder has remained out with an undisclosed injury the past two weeks), the Patriots have looked a bit vulnerable at times in practice. Backup left tackle LaAdrian Waddle also went down with an injury Tuesday, and like Rivers at defensive end, he has also returned to Boston for further evaluation.\n\nThese are currently top personnel concerns facing the Patriots.", "id": "9697793", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Top draft pick Derek Rivers returns to Boston for further tests on injury", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0817%2Fr245363_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "198406", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "203969", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "White Sulphur Springs"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "203982", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sulphur_Springs,_West_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "White Sulphur Springs"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "id": "305661", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}, "id": "309398", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "id": "309400", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "id": "310749", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end"}, {"label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}, "id": "312085", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dwight Freeney"}, "id": "329512", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Freeney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}, "id": "341274", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Greenbrier"}, "id": "369719", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greenbrier"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rob Ninkovich"}, "id": "387091", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Ninkovich"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jonathan Casillas"}, "id": "389044", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Casillas"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kony Ealy"}, "id": "394504", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kony_Ealy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Akeem Ayers"}, "id": "400111", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akeem_Ayers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nate Solder"}, "id": "470396", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Solder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jim Whalen"}, "id": "644382", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Whalen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}, "id": "1269622", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trey Flowers"}, "id": "1274551", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Flowers"}, {"label": {"eng": "Akiem Hicks"}, "id": "1274884", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiem_Hicks"}, {"label": {"eng": "Deatrich Wise"}, "id": "1327194", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deatrich_Wise"}, {"label": {"eng": "Geneo Grissom"}, "id": "1384604", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneo_Grissom"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "White Sulphur Springs"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 603, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling"}], "time": "13:29:00"}

The team has an impressive track record of signing rookies off the street and turning them into key role players or starters.\n\nWith the success of the current crop of rookie free agents, including tight end Jacob Hollister, wide receiver Austin Carr, linebacker Harvey Langi, defensive tackle Adam Butler and cornerbacks Kenny Moore and D.J. Killings, we began to think about the best Patriots undrafted free agents in the Bill Belichick-era.\n\nTo limit the pool, we're only including players originally signed by the Patriots. That leaves out guys like Larry Izzo, Matt Chatham, Jermaine Wiggins, Adam Vinatieri, Wes Welker, Kyle Arrington, Dan Connolly, Joe Andruzzi, Danny Amendola, LeGarrette Blount and Justin Coleman.\n\nSo, without further ado, here are the 10 best Patriots undrafted free agents that Belichick originally signed.\n\n10. CB RANDALL GAY\n\nGay was kind of the original Malcolm Butler (we'll get to him soon). Gay went undrafted in 2004 and eventually earned a big role in a Patriots Super Bowl victory. He started Super Bowl XXXIX and made 10 tackles, one pass breakup and one forced fumble.\n\nGay struggled with injuries through his Patriots career but started 14 games in four years at cornerback while also working at safety and in the slot. He intercepted five passes and recorded 74 tackles with 14 pass breakups.\n\nGay went on to sign a four-year, $17.8 million contract with the Saints.\n\n9. P RYAN ALLEN\n\nAllen has provided a steady presence at punter since beating out Zoltan Mesko during training camp in 2013. While Belichick might prefer Allen's college teammate, Los Angeles Rams punter Johnny \"The Weapon\" Hekker, Allen certainly hasn't been shabby, averaging 45.7 yards per punt with the Patriots. Allen ranks 11th in the NFL all time in yards per punt.\n\n8. LS LONIE PAXTON\n\nHere's a fun and possibly unexpected stat: Paxton ranks sixth in games played with the Patriots under Belichick with 155. Only Tom Brady, Stephen Gostkowski, Vince Wilfork, Matt Light and Kevin Faulk have played more games under Belichick with the Patriots.\n\nIt's tough to assess a long snapper, but he was good enough to anchor the position for nine seasons. He left the Patriots after signing a five-year, $5.3 million contract with the Denver Broncos.\n\n7. RB BRANDON BOLDEN\n\nBolden has had to wear many hats during his five-year career with the Patriots, rushing for 845 yards with six touchdowns, catching 46 passes for 366 yards with two touchdowns and making 19 tackles on special teams.\n\nBolden has provided the Patriots with security at multiple running back roles while playing special teams at a high level as he's earned two Super Bowl rings.\n\n6. DT MIKE WRIGHT\n\nWright has become a bit of a forgotten man since he played on the Patriots in the era between Super Bowl victories, signing in 2005 and retiring after the 2011 season. Wright's career was plagued by concussions, and while he started just 22 games, he was a disruptive presence in the middle of the Patriots' defense as an interior pass rusher. Wright recorded 15 sacks with 99 tackles in seven seasons.\n\n5. OL RYAN WENDELL\n\nWendell had a bit of a strange career with the Patriots, starting 49 games, but he never really nailed down a guaranteed role.\n\nWendell bounced between guard and center with the Patriots and helped the team solidify their offensive line early in their 2014 Super Bowl XLIX championship team, when he took over right guard duties from Jordan Devey (why Devey was ever starting over Wendell is one of the biggest mysteries in Patriots history).\n\nHe was named a captain in 2015 but played just two games, starting none before being placed on the non-football illness list.\n\n4. C DAVID ANDREWS\n\nIt was a tough task to rank between Wendell and Andrews on this list. While Wendell played longer, Andrews possesses a more solid standing as the team's starting center than Wendell ever appeared to have. Both players are undersized offensive linemen who ultimately get and got the job done despite their small stature.\n\nAndrews signed a three-year, $9 million contract extension which will keep him on the Patriots through the 2020 season.\n\n3. RB BENJARVUS GREEN-ELLIS\n\nOnly five running backs have recorded 1,000-yard seasons under Belichick with the Patriots, and Green-Ellis is one. He carried the ball 229 times for 1,008 yards with 13 touchdowns in 2010. He added another 11 touchdowns in 2011 and, perhaps most importantly, never fumbled during his four-year Patriots career before leaving for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n2. G STEVE NEAL\n\nNeal might be the proudest project of Belichick's coaching career. Belichick brings up Neal whenever he's asked about a player having to learn a new position on the fly.\n\nNeal was an All-American college wrestler and didn't play football at Cal State Bakersfield before the Patriots signed him in 2001. He played in two games, starting one, in 2002 then didn't play again until 2004 because of a shoulder injury. He went on to start 80 regular season games and 12 playoff games, including Super Bowls XXXIX and XLII.\n\n1. CB MALCOLM BUTLER\n\nThis shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Butler not only made the game-clinching play in Super Bowl XLIX, but he went on to become an All-Pro and Pro Bowl selection. Butler now is one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL after he initially signed with the team as a tryout player.", "id": "9688710", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Who Are The Patriots'

It was a heck of a way for Garoppolo to rebound from a woeful 2-of-10 start to practice.\n\nAnd again, even with just a snapshot of practice, it fit with the pattern of Garoppolo's career. He might not always be on, but he tends to play well under pressure.\n\nAs such, Garoppolo maintained his momentum from Thursday's preseason opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars when he completed 22-of-28 passes for 235 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe fourth-year backup was close to finishing in the tank yesterday, too. His first try at the two-minute drill opened with a sack and an incompletion to tight end Dwayne Allen on second down. But Garoppolo fired a dart to wide receiver Danny Amendola on third down and later added strikes to fellow receivers Malcolm Mitchell and Devin Lucien and running back Rex Burkhead to set up a field goal and complete the objective of the period.\n\nGaroppolo closed the practice by going 6-of-6 with a touchdown to Mitchell on their fourth connection of the day. It was a significant way to close down the most competitive practice of training camp because Garoppolo's reps are numbered before Tom Brady takes over the starting quarterback job on a full-time basis.\n\n\"It's great,\" Garoppolo said of the competition with the Texans. \"You can really gauge where our team is. .\u2009.\u2009. They're talented across the board defensively, so it's a good test for us.\"\n\nGilmore cornered\n\nCornerback Stephon Gilmore didn't participate in team drills during practice, so his activity today will be monitored. There weren't any obvious signs of an injury, but Gilmore worked during the early positional portion before sticking to the sideline for the remainder of the day.\n\nAfter practice, Gilmore hung around the field to catch up with some old friends on the Texans, so it's noteworthy that he wasn't immediately summoned to the training room. Whatever the case, the Patriots don't want to take any risks with Gilmore, who has been among the defensive stars in camp after signing a five-year, $65 million contract this offseason.\n\nThe connection between the Patriots and Texans grew stronger over the offseason when the AFC South champions added Wes Welker to the coaching staff. The former receiver doesn't have the glamorous title or responsibilities yet, but he is off to a good start with Bill O'Brien's group.\n\nWide receiver Julian Edelman has been among the countless players who have learned from Welker over the years, so he was proud to see Welker get this opportunity.\n\n\"Wes is such a smart, intelligent football player,\" Edelman said of the Pats' career receptions leader (672). \"He's a grinder, meaning he earned everything he got. He didn't start on third (base). He had to have a long journey to get to being, ultimately, a revolutionary player who basically created a position.\"\n\nLil' Gronk\n\nFullback Glenn Gronkowski drew one of the largest ovations of the exhibition opener last week against the Jaguars when he caught a 10-yard pass in the first quarter. It's unclear if the Gronkowskis monopolized the noise, but tight end Rob Gronkowski was certainly happy to see his little brother enjoy some success.\n\n\"It's fun watching my brother go out there,\" Rob Gronkowski said. \"The game the other night, it was a blast watching him make some plays.", "id": "9700531", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Patriots notebook: Jimmy Garoppolo

New England coach Bill Belichick kept all of the Patriots' expected starters and several of the top reserves on the sidelines during a 31-24 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nNew England plays the Houston Texans on Saturday night in the second full week of the NFL preseason schedule. At least one Patriots starter won't play again - linebacker Dont'a Hightower.\n\nThe former Alabama All-American has not practiced with the team in training camp. The Patriots placed Hightower on the physically-unable-to-perform list at the start of training camp on July 24. The team did not cite any specific ailment for Hightower, but he's been nagged by shoulder and knee injuries for most of his NFL career.\n\nHightower has been at every practice, but he's worked on a separate field with trainers.\n\nBelichick is famously reticent about revealing information concerning injuries, but he gave an update on Hightower during his press conference on Wednesday when asked if the team expected the linebacker to be ready to play quickly once he returns to practice.\n\n\"Every year is a new year for all of us,\" Belichick said. \"We all have to go through the process of getting our performance level up to the highest that we can in this particular season. We all face that challenge, every player and every coach. A lot of guys are in different situations and different circumstances. We all have to go through the same process, whatever those circumstances are.\n\n\"Dont'a is working hard. He's doing what he can do, and when he's ready to do more, which he has already this year, then he'll do more and he'll move ahead when he's ready. We'll just have to see what that timeframe brings.\"\n\nIn his fifth NFL season, Hightower called defensive signals for the Patriots and earned Pro Bowl recognition as New England won its second Super Bowl in three years in the 2016 campaign.\n\nAfter visiting Houston on Saturday, New England has the Detroit Lions on Aug. 25 and the New York Giants on Aug. 31 left on its preseason schedule before the Patriots play in the first game of the NFL's regular season.

Despite announcing their split following the drama, Annie, who shares four children with Kyle, has been supporting him during the Euros.\n\nHolding her son outside of the stadium, Lauryn donned a pair of beige cargo trousers with a white T-shirt and cream jacket.

Kyle, the Manchester City footballer, reportedly fathered his first child with Lauryn during a break from his relationship with Annie in 2019. He later reconciled with Annie and is believed to have tied the knot with her in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Lauryn gave birth to her second child with Kyle after he had a fling with her despite being with Annie.

Though it is reported the 33-year-old is set to fly out later in the tournament so her kids can also \"watch Daddy play\".\n\nBoth women put their little ones in full England kits with Kyle's number 2 on the back. One of the shirts said \"Dad\" on it, while Lauryn's kids' shirts said \"Daddy\" on the back as they had a kick around in a Sussex park.\n\nThough Annie appeared to be supporting her England player husband, who she shares sons Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, Reign, five, and two-month-old Rezon with, she is said to have vowed not to play \"happy families\" after things \"got really bad\" between the couple following the revelation he has two more children.\n\nAnnie, 32, has apparently agreed to fly in and out of Germany on a private jet for every England game, but is only doing it \"for the sake of the children\". She reportedly wants to keep out of the spotlight and sat away from the other WAGs \"because she doesn't feel she is in a proper relationship with Kyle and doesn't want to maintain any pretence that she is\".\n\nLauryn on the other hand - who is mum to Kairo, four, and a one-year-old daughter known only as K.W - is said to be bringing a film crew with her when she lands in Germany next week for England's third group gain against Slovenia on June 26. A source revealed a camera crew might be present to document her every move as Lauryn has signed up for a new documentary series exposing life as a \"WAG\". Though Kyle has maintained he didn't have a relationship with her, despite getting her pregnant twice.\n\nThe 34-year-old footballer had his first child with Lauryn in 2019 during a temporary split from childhood sweetheart Annie. He and Annie later reconciled and got married in 2021 - but Kyle cheated again and Lauryn gave birth to their second child in August 2022.\n\nIn December, Lauryn broke the news about her baby girl to Annie, who was pregnant with her fourth child at the time. Annie has since revealed that she is parting ways with Kyle, who has moved out of their family home in Prestbury, Cheshire, to a rented property nearby.\n\nA source told The Sun on Sunday: \"Lauryn truly believes that Kyle will want his son there. She has been given tickets and the flights have been sorted out for her to go. Kyle and Lauryn haven't spoken since Annie discovered they share a daughter. However, during the World Cup, it was Kyle who asked for Kairo to attend the Euros. Since that day, Kairo has been excited. What little lad wouldn't be?

His wife and mum of his four children Annie Kilner has already been spotted in Germany supporting the sports star from the stands. Annie reportedly boarded a private jet alongside other partners of footballers from England's squad.\n\nThe national team are competing against Denmark in their second match of Euro 2024 in Germany on Thursday evening with Annie, 30, at the match in Frankfurt. However, Lauryn has also been spotted outside the stadium holding her son Kairo. Lauryn, who shares two children with Kyle, wore a white T-shirt, cream jacket and beige cargo trousers as she held her son.\n\nKairo was dressed in a full England hit and proudly waved a flag. It's also been claimed that Lauryn plans to attend England's third group game, which will be against Slovenia, next week. She's reportedly preparing to take her son Kairo, four, who was fathered by Kyle. Kyle's also the father of Lauryn's one-year-old daughter, whose name has not been disclosed.\n\nKyle is said to have fathered his first child with Lauryn whilst temporarily separated from his partner Annie in 2019. They later reconciled and reportedly got married in 2021. Last year, Lauryn welcomed her second child with Kyle. A source previously told the Sun on Sunday: \"Lauryn truly believes that Kyle will want his son [at the Euros].\n\n\"She has been given tickets and the flights have been sorted out for her to go. Kyle and Lauryn haven't spoken since Annie discovered they share a daughter. However, during the World Cup, it was Kyle who asked for Kairo to attend the Euros.\" They added that Kairo \"shouldn't have to watch\" Kyle playing on TV, as he \"deserves\" to be in the crowd at the tournament.\n\nKyle is also facing \"fresh heartache\" as Lauryn's signed up for Celebs Go Dating \"at the height of his Euros campaign\". It's been announced that she has agreed to appear on the next series of the E4 show. A source told the Mirror that the content creator is \"only going on the show to have another dig at Kyle,\" adding to it will also keep her in the spotlight. It has however also been suggested that she's looking forward to dating.\n\n\"Lauryn going on the show is a big step and shows Kyle and what happened with them is very much in the past. She is looking forward to the dating aspect,\" a source told us. They added: \"That said you can guarantee Kyle's ears will be burning when they film the show as his name will no doubt come up plenty of times. Lauren is excited to go on the show and just wants to have some fun, but if she can meet a new man on the TV show or a potential boyfriend that will be a bonus.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_o_hare@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mia O'Hare", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairo_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kairo (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E4 (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebs_Go_Dating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebs Go Dating"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33074574.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_football-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666456", "eventUri": "eng-9666456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

given her take on the drama, which this month saw mum-of-one Chloe, 31, marry Grant Hall, 32, without her elder sibling in attendance.\n\nInstead, Lauryn, 33, was spotted just minutes away on board a boat in the Algarve with her kids, who she shares with England footballer Kyle Walker, 33.\n\nWe previously reported how Lauryn was branded \"toxic\" during the pair's spat earlier this year, before she was uninvited from the Ex On The Beach alumni's nuptials altogether.\n\nChloe and Lauryn had unfollowed each other on social media after a \"bad fall out\" related to the news that Kyle had a second child with Lauryn.\n\nChloe's husband Grant is a football player for Rotherham United, so their circles often overlap.\n\nHe also unfollowed Lauryn on social media when the identity of her daughter's father, this being right-back Kyle, broke in 2023.\n\nKerry took to her New Magazine column to muse on the family feud and wrote: \"I've been reading about the feud between Lauryn Goodman and her sister Chloe, who got married last week and is said to have uninvited Lauryn.\n\n\"It's hard to know what goes on behind closed doors with families and it is a shame Lauryn didn't see her sister get married, but I don't agree with what she did when it comes to Kyle Walker.\"\n\nWhole Again singer was referring to how Lauryn and Kyle are parents to son Kairo, four, who was conceived in 2020 when England Kyle was on a break from his wife Annie Kilner, 30.\n\nThey also share a daughter who Lauryn gave birth to in August 2023.\n\nA source recently told The Sun: \"Kyle and Lauryn aren't speaking since Annie found out they have a daughter together too.\"\n\nLauryn will also soon publish a tell-all autobiography about her affair with Kyle.\n\nKerry, a mum of five, then added: \"The whole situation has caused so much drama and I feel sorry for the kids involved more than anything.\n\n\"This will really impact all of them.\"\n\nAs well as Lauryn's two kids, Chloe is mum to daughter Isla, who recently celebrated her fourth birthday.\n\nEarlier this month, a source told The Sun how the sisters had a major falling out a week before the ceremony.\n\nThis then led aesthetics salon owner Chloe to tell mum-of-two Lauryn that she wasn't welcome.\n\nAn insider told us: \"Chloe was adamant about her decision.\n\n\"Their mother spent most of the week trying to reconcile the sisters, but Chloe stood firm.\n\n\"It was a tense time for the family.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lauryn has risked the wrath of her baby daddy and his wife Annie by jetting to the Euros with his son Kairo.\n\nYet Annie and Kyle were seen putting on a loved-up display as they stood in the stands after England's clash with Serbia, which resulted in a 1-0 win for the Three Lions.\n\nAnnie had previously advised reality TV star Lauryn to \"stay away from the Euros.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle previously told how he was dealt \"unrealistic demands\" by Lauryn to keep their second love child a

Annie Kilner", "body": "And now, with the Euros 2024 well under way, Annie Kilner and Lauryn Goodman are set to come face-to-face as they take their children to support shamed Kyle Walker.\n\nThe England ace, who has been with his childhood sweetheart Annie for 15 years, fathered two love children with influencer Lauryn during their relationship.\n\nAnnie, 32, met Kyle, 34, when she was 16 and he was 18 playing for his hometown club Sheffield United.\n\nThe couple secretly wed in November 2021 - but their relationship came crashing down after it was revealed Kyle had fathered a second secret love child with Lauryn, 33.\n\nThe love triangle started in 2019 and has seen the WAGs publicly clash in the press and on social media countless times.\n\nKyle shares four sons - Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, Reign, five, and baby Rezon with Annie - and two with Lauryn - Kairo, four, and a daughter, 11-months.\n\nIt was revealed last month that Lauryn has plans to write a tell-all autobiography about her affair with Kyle.\n\nBut with every detail of her love affair for the England right back already shared with the world - as well as at least 30 swipes at Annie - a book might not be necessary.\n\nKyle and Lauryn had a \"brief\" relationship in summer 2019 after she dumped football agent Dane Rashford -- brother of Manchester United striker Marcus.\n\nIt was first announced that she was expecting a baby with a Three Lions ace the following January.\n\nHowever, Kyle was not disclosed as the father until a month later.\n\nLauryn's first swipe at Annie came when she exposed her unborn child's father, telling her followers she'd \"rather people heard it from the horse's mouth\".\n\n\"Kyle Walker and I are expecting a baby in April and it was conceived during a period we had both split from our previous partners,\" she told The Sun on Sunday at the time.\n\n\"This will be the last time I comment on it and I will only be sharing the positive journey going forward.\"\n\nLauryn said specialists had warned her she would never be able to conceive naturally because she suffered from endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nHeartbroken Annie dumped the Manchester City ace over the love child.\n\nIt was reported that Lauryn threatened legal action against Annie at this time if she spoke out despite publicly revealing her pregnancy.\n\nAnnie posted a savage quote on her Instagram stories shortly after Kyle's first love child was born, where she hit out at \"disrespectful men\".\n\nThe post read: \"A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless h**.\"\n\nLauryn was quick to take a swipe back on her own account.\n\n\"This is harassment,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I've just had a newborn baby and I'm having to deal with this on a Sunday morning.\n\n\"I have said repeatedly, I was never, ever friends with her and her using my name in the press to gain sympathy for a relationship that had ended before our baby's conception is shocking.\"\n\nIn May 2020 and settling into life as a first-time mum, Lauryn made her second round of jabs at Annie.\n\nShe posted a short video of Gemma Collins during her time on Celebrity Big Brother, which was reportedly supposed to mirror the feud between the pair.\n\nThe short clip shows Gemma arguing with EastEnders actor John Partridge and Gemma says: \"You should really try to forget about me.\n\n\"You are obsessed with me and I love it!\"\n\nLauryn captioned the pic: \"She is obsessed with and and I love it!\"\n\nWhen Annie praised The Sun for revealing the truth behind her split from Kyle in June 2020, Lauryn didn't take it lying down.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Annie wrote: \"A real woman will never break another woman's home to make her own home.\n\n\"Thank you to The Sun for finally getting the truth out there.\"\n\nLauryn was quick to issue a statement of her own by posting a comment from her legal team on Instagram.\n\nIt read: \"My client will not be commenting on the stories that have appeared in today's press.\n\n\"She, Ms Kilner and Mr Walker know the truth and she has no wish to be drawn into a media spat, particularly as Ms Kilner's concerns appear to be directed at Mr Walker.\"\n\nAmid the scandal, Kyle proposed to Annie with a \u00a3250,000 ring by setting up a floral heart of white roses, surrounded by petals and candles, at their Cheshire home.\n\nTwo days later on June 22, which was also Father's Day, Lauryn made an emotional post where she branded the footballer as \"weak\".\n\n\"To know I am solely responsible for bringing my baby up makes me work so much harder,\" she penned.\n\n\"I will bring you up with love, respect and strength in a home with wonderful family values.\n\n\"You will be brought up to be strong where you make your own decisions and you don't let anyone influence or control you, because being weak is an inherited sign I don't wish you to have.\"\n\nA few months later in September, she made another dig at Annie's relationship drama by boasting \"not my circus\" on Instagram stories.\n\nThe subtle swipe came the day after then-fianc\u00e9e Annie admitted to having a fling with a toyboy Joshua Cox, 20.\n\nShe insisted that the romance began when they split up in February when it was revealed that Lauryn was pregnant with his child.\n\nWhen Kyle moved out of their home, Annie was introduced to Josh and they began dating.\n\nShortly after the birth of their baby, Lauryn has caused a stir by wearing a necklace with the initials 'KW'.\n\nThe necklace had been given to her by her younger sister Chloe Goodman, who is famous herself for stints on Ex On The Beach and Celebrity Big Brother.\n\nLauryn was quick to explain the initials read 'KW' because her son's real name wasn't Junior, as she had previously said.\n\nThe 'Junior' nickname suggested at the time that the baby could be called Kyle like his dad.\n\nHowever, it was revealed in March 2021 that the tot was called Kairo.\n\nThe mum-of-two was papped wearing the necklace throughout her first love child scandal, including when at the supermarket and on holiday.\n\nWhen she revealed his name, Lauryn defended giving him his dad's surname.\n\n\"Single mums have questioned why Kairo's surname is Walker because they say they don't want to give the father the satisfaction of them having their surname,\" she said.\n\n\"It was a mutual decision to name him Walker and I honoured that.\"\n\nLauryn then publically slammed Annie and Kyle in May 2021 when his new football boots had his eldest three sons' names on but not Kairo's.\n\nThe Man City star showed off his new pair of boots on Instagram, which had the names and dates of birth of his then-three children with Annie.\n\nRiaan, Reign and Roman each received a spot on the boot, but Kairo didn't.\n\n\"See this is the thing, Mums fight for their babies,\" she penned on Instagram. \"Kairo has done nothing apart from be adorable.\n\n\"Women are not scared to have their say. I may have less followers but I am a real person who will fight for Kairo until I am no longer here.\"\n\nLauryn later declared the boots as \"bullying\" and demanded a public apology from Kyle and sports brand Puma.\n\nShe even started a petition for Puma to publicly denounce Kyle and called the boots a \"triggering outlandish callous action endorsed by\" the brand.\n\nThe petition only received 1,910 signatures, and Annie took to Instagram a few days later to call Kyle the \"best daddy\".\n\nIn March 2023, Lauryn announced that she was pregnant with her second child - and rumours about who the father was started instantly.\n\nKyle and Annie tied the knot secretly in 2021, but when the Man City player exposed himself in a bar and snogged a random woman in March 2023, things started to go downhill.\n\nRebekah Vardy hit out at Annie in an Instagram post where she called her a \"doormat\".\n\nLauryn wasted no time supporting Wagatha Christie's Rebekah - and even referred to Annie as a dog.\n\nShe shared a link to buying dog muzzles in an astonishing swipe and told her to \"put a muzzle on it\".\n\nLauryn penned on a separate story: \"Stop igniting the flame claiming others want the limelight. Stop trying to make out you want a private life. How many friends do you want to blame?\n\n\"It's come back to me what horrific things you have been calling my son (words I wouldn't wish to repeat because I wouldn't want it out there for him to read when he's older).\n\n\"Just remember what goes around comes around.\"\n\nIt was later revealed that Lauryn told a pal she was \"ready to finish\" Kyle and Annie's marriage in July 2022.\n\nAnother text she sent said: \"Ask him if he wants to go with me again? I'm down for baby number 2 [five laughing emojis].\"\n\nThe WAG war intensified between the mothers of Kyle's children when ex-fling Lauryn shared a photo of son Kairo, then three, in a Man City shirt bearing his number two after the team's treble triumph in June last year.\n\nWife Annie hit back with pictures of her with Kyle and their three eldest boys -- Riaan, Roman and Reign -- on the pitch after the Champions League Final win over Inter Milan in Istanbul.\n\nShe penned: \"Three is the magic number. winning the champions league with your daddy. All these memories you get to have with your daddy. Nothing and no one will ever take that from you. We've got you three.\"\n\nFurious Lauryn retaliated in an interview with The Sun on Sunday, branding Annie \"cruel, vindictive and nasty\".\n\n\"I have had enough of this nastiness, it has been going on too long,\" she said.\n\n\"Kairo has done nothing wrong and Annie cannot eradicate him from existence. He is Kyle Walker's son.\n\n\"He doesn't just have three sons - Annie needs to accept that.\"\n\nShe called the model a \"wicked stepmother\" and accused her of treating Kairo like an \"outcast\".\n\n\"When Annie got back with Kyle she knew I was pregnant,\" Lauryn added.\n\n\"If she couldn't handle the fact he was going to have another child she should never have gotten back with him.\n\n\"Annie needs to talk to someone if she still has issues over Kyle being Kairo's dad, instead of being so venomous to our child.\n\n\"She is taking it out on Kairo instead of Kyle - you can't sweep Kairo under the carpet, our son is not a dirty secret.\"\n\nIt was not public knowledge yet that Kyle was the dad of Lauryn's second child.\n\nShe further teased Annie by saying the father was \"in the picture\" and said his identity \"will be known when the time is right\".\n\nWhen the baby girl was born in July 2023, rumours that Kyle had fathered a second lovechild were further fuelled by sources confirming \"the dad is a footballer\".\n\nKyle added fuel to the fire in September 2023 when he bought Lauryn a \u00a32.5 million home on the coast to raise her two children.\n\nThen, the day after Boxing Day, Annie received a \u00admessage \"out of the blue\" alleging that Kyle was the dad to Lauryn's second child.\n\nLauryn is understood to have bluntly written: \"I don't have two baby daddies -- I have one.\"\n\nShe had also forwarded a photo of Kyle enjoying a play date with both their children in a park.\n\nSources said that Annie \"was floored\" by the message, adding that the marriage had been on the rocks for months after Lauryn taunted her online about the identity of the baby's father.\n\nShe tearfully confronted the Man City full-back and the pair argued before she ordered him to leave the \u00a32.4 million family home.\n\nDays after it was revealed Kyle is the father of both of Lauryn's kids, she was spotted fleeing the country from Gatwick Airport and checking in three suitcases branded with 'KW'.\n\nThat same day, Lauryn revealed that she had shown Annie a DNA test to prove Kyle was the dad.\n\n\"I didn't want to cause any more heartache for Annie or be a bitch but I had to tell her because Kyle was too weak to do it,\" she told The Sun.\n\n\"The day after Boxing Day, I got someone to message Annie because I knew he was away playing so I could speak to her and tell her the truth in private.\n\n\"Kyle had denied she was his daughter many, many times. I don't think Annie wanted to believe it was true, which is understandable.\n\n\"She kept asking for proof, so I showed her the DNA test but even then she doubted it was real until I pointed out my daughter's name on the paperwork.\n\n\"Annie and I later FaceTimed and my daughter was there.\"\n\nLauryn added more fuel to the fire by saying she \"doesn't blame herself for their marriage breaking up\" as she knows of other women who have been with Kyle.\n\nIt was soon revealed that Annie was pregnant with her fourth child with Kyle.\n\nDays after Annie's pregnancy was made public, Lauryn interviewed with MailPlus and claimed Annie had even apologised to her - adding she once \"hated\" her secret lover's wife.\n\nAnnie welcomed her fourth son with Kyle in April 2024 and was at her side for the birth -- despite them splitting in January\n\nLauryn took the opportunity to share messages about a \"perfect family\" on her Instagram page.\n\nA pre-written quote read: \"Sometimes a perfect family is just a mum and her kids.\"\n\nLauryn penned alongside the image: \"One of each. Their love for each other is perfect. Couldn't be more blessed.\"\n\nDespite the drama, Lauryn has been \"determined\" to get her two children pitch side at the 2024 Euros in Germany.\n\nIt was exclusively revealed by The Sun in April that she told a pal: \"I am determined my children will get to see their daddy playing for the Three Lions this summer.\"\n\nLauryn further alleged that Kyle made the promise to Kairo because the youngster didn't go to the 2022 World Cup.\n\nA source said: \"During the World Cup Kyle would message Lauryn saying, 'That win, that celebration\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009was for Kairo'.\n\n\"He even brought Kairo a World Cup ball and a shirt back. Kyle apparently said he was sorry Kairo wasn't there and wanted him at the Euros.\"\n\nAnnie remained silent but reportedly told a friend in private that Lauryn wants to go to \"inevitably create a drama\" that will \"distract\" the team.\n\nIt was confirmed last week that Lauryn has tickets and flights booked to Germany for England's third Euros group game.\n\nAt the same time, new pictures of her children wearing Three Lions kits that read 'DADDY' and the number two on the back were released.\n\nKyle wears a number two shirt for England, as well as Man City.\n\nShe will now fly out for the game against Slovenia, in Cologne, on June 25.\n\nHer plan is to travel to games with three of her four sons with Kyle but to not stay for more than a day.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk",

Lauryn and Chloe Goodman clash", "body": "KERRY Katona has waded into the feud between sisters Lauryn and Chloe Goodman, admitting she \"feels sorry\" for their kids.\n\nThe Atomic Kitten songstress has given her take on the drama, which this month saw mum-of-one Chloe, 31, marry Grant Hall, 32, without her elder sibling in attendance.\n\nChloe and Lauryn had unfollowed each other on social media after a \"bad fall out\" related to the news that Kyle had a second child with Lauryn.\n\nChloe's husband Grant is a football player for Rotherham United, so their circles often overlap.\n\nHe also unfollowed Lauryn on social media when the identity of her daughter's father, this being right-back Kyle, broke in 2023.\n\nKerry took to her New Magazine column to muse on the family feud and wrote: \"I've been reading about the feud between Lauryn Goodman and her sister Chloe, who got married last week and is said to have uninvited Lauryn.\n\n\"It's hard to know what goes on behind closed doors with families and it is a shame Lauryn didn't see her sister get married, but I don't agree with what she did when it comes to Kyle Walker.\"\n\nWhole Again singer was referring to how Lauryn and Kyle are parents to son Kairo, four, who was conceived in 2020 when England Kyle was on a break from his wife Annie Kilner, 30.\n\nThey also share a daughter who Lauryn gave birth to in August 2023.\n\nA source recently told The Sun: \"Kyle and Lauryn aren't speaking since Annie found out they have a daughter together too.\"\n\nLauryn will also soon publish a tell-all autobiography about her affair with Kyle.\n\nKerry, a mum of five, then added: \"The whole situation has caused so much drama and I feel sorry for the kids involved more than anything.\n\n\"This will really impact all of them.\"\n\nAs well as Lauryn's two kids, Chloe is mum to daughter Isla, who recently celebrated her fourth birthday.\n\nEarlier this month, a source told The Sun how the sisters had a major falling out a week before the ceremony.\n\nThis then led aesthetics salon owner Chloe to tell mum-of-two Lauryn that she wasn't welcome.\n\nAn insider told us: \"Chloe was adamant about her decision.\n\n\"Their mother spent most of the week trying to reconcile the sisters, but Chloe stood firm.\n\n\"It was a tense time for the family.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lauryn has risked the wrath of her baby daddy and his wife Annie by jetting to the Euros with his son Kairo.\n\nYet Annie and Kyle were seen putting on a loved-up display as they stood in the stands after England's clash with Serbia, which resulted in a 1-0 win for the Three Lions.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle previously told how he was dealt \"unrealistic demands\" by Lauryn to keep their second love child a secret.", "source": {"uri":

Annie, 30, is now expected to be at the match in Frankfurt in support of her estranged husband Kyle Walker, 34.\n\nShe was previously among the audience at the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday for England's victorious first match of the tournament, which was against Serbia. It's been claimed that Annie plans to fly out for each game, rather than stay in Germany for the duration of the Euros.\n\nAnnie's said to have boarded a private jet at Manchester Airport on Thursday morning just hours before the team's next match later in the evening. She has reportedly been joined by other partners of players on the plane.\n\nThe Daily Mail has shared photos of passengers boarding an aircraft, though it's unclear if Annie's among them. The outlet however reports that she's on board the flight and that the group have headed to Frankfurt for the football team's next game, which will be at Deutche Bank Park.\n\nIt comes following the claim that Annie doesn't intend to pretend to be \"happy families\" with her husband Kyle during the tournament. There's said to have been tension between them following the news that the footballer fathered two children with model Lauryn,33.\n\nA source told the Daily Mail previously that Annie has only agreed to attend England's matches \"for the sake of\" her four children with Kyle. They are parents to Roman, 12, Riaan, eight, Reign, six, and two-month-old Rezon together.\n\nIt's also been claimed that Lauryn plans to attend England's third group game, which will be against Slovenia, next week. She's reportedly preparing to take her son Kairo, four, who was fathered by Kyle. Kyle's also the father of Lauryn's one-year-old daughter, whose name has not been disclosed.\n\nKyle is said to have fathered his first child with Lauryn whilst temporarily separated from his partner Annie in 2019. They later reconciled and reportedly got married in 2021. Last year, Lauryn welcomed her second child with Kyle.\n\nAs previously reported, a source told the Sun on Sunday: \"Lauryn truly believes that Kyle will want his son [at the Euros]. She has been given tickets and the flights have been sorted out for her to go. Kyle and Lauryn haven't spoken since Annie discovered they share a daughter. However, during the World Cup, it was Kyle who asked for Kairo to attend the Euros.\" They added that Kairo \"shouldn't have to watch\" Kyle playing on TV, as he \"deserves\" to be in the crowd at the tournament.\n\nIt was reported this week that Kyle \"faces fresh heartache\" as Lauryn's signed up for Celebs Go Dating \"at the height of his Euros campaign\". It's been announced that she has agreed to appear on the next series of the E4 show.\n\nA source claimed to the Mirror that the content creator is \"only going on the show to have another dig at Kyle,\" adding to it will also keep her in the spotlight. It has however also been suggested that she's looking forward to dating.\n\n\"Lauryn going on the show is a big step and shows Kyle and what happened with them is very much in the past. She is looking forward to the dating aspect,\" a source told us. They added: \"That said you can guarantee Kyle's ears will be burning when they film the show as his name will no doubt come up plenty of times. Lauren is excited to go on the show and just wants to have some fun, but if she can meet a new man on the TV show or a potential boyfriend that will be a bonus.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_leaver@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joel Leaver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_AufSchalke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena AufSchalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelsenkirchen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gelsenkirchen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebs_Go_Dating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celebs Go Dating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33072651.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_England-v-Senegal-Round-of-16-FIFA-World-Cup-Qatar-2022.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666456", "eventUri": "eng-9666456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

But after signing a deal with bosses, the wannabe WAG is also thought to have agreed to discuss her previous footballer fling in detail on the show.\n\nHer appearance on the reality series could also mean fresh pain for Kyle's wife Annie Kilner, who is keen to move on from Kyle's affair with Lauryn which has threatened to end their marriage forever. One TV source claimed Lauryn is \"only going on the show to have another dig at Kyle\" and it will also keep her in the spotlight.\n\nBut a friend close to Lauryn said: \"Lauryn going on the show is a big step and shows Kyle and what happened with them is very much in the past. She is looking forward to the dating aspect.\n\n\"That said you can guarantee Kyle's ears will be burning when they film the show as his name will no doubt come up plenty of times. Lauren is excited to go on the show and just wants to have some fun, but if she can meet a new man on the TV show or a potential boyfriend that will be a bonus.\"\n\nLauryn will now work on Celebs Go Dating in the coming weeks with filming understood to be around 4-6 weeks. The contract is thought to be worth up to \u00a355,000.\n\nEngland full back Kyle, who is also 33 and preparing for England's second game at the Euros, has two children with Lauren. He confirmed he was the father of Lauryn's daughter in January, while his wife Annie Kilner was heavily pregnant with their fourth child. He had already fathered son Kairo with the influencer after a short-lived relationship while separated from Annie in 2020.\n\nIn January, apologetic Kyle spoke honestly about his personal issues in an interview. At the time he said: \"What I've done is horrible and I take full responsibility. \"I made idiot choices and idiot decisions. I can't begin to think or imagine what Annie is going through.\"\n\nHe added: The only person to blame is me. I have roles and responsibilities that I'm aware of and I've made stupid choices. But I need to own up to my mistakes -- I owe it to everyone. My actions have caused a lot of pain to a lot of people. I'm sorry because, as a family, this isn't meant to happen.\"\n\nAs Kyle tries to move on, single Lauryn could take her children out to the Euros to watch their dad play for England. Reports at the weekend said she may attend an England match in the coming days. Her son Kairo has the current England kit with 'Daddy' and the number two on the back and has been photographed wearing it in recent weeks.\n\nSince confirming he was father of Lauryn's second child, Manchester City star Walker has been trying to make things up with wife Annie. He was kicked out of the family home for four months but is now back in the \u00a33.5million home in Prestbury, Cheshire. He hopes he and wife Annie can now make a go of things.\n\nFor England's first Euro match against Serbia, Annie Kilner arrived by private jet in Germany with three of their four kids - Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, and Reign, five while baby Rezon stayed home.\n\nIn February it was reported Lauryn was in talks to front and star in a reality series about wannabe WAGs, following women who have dated or have been married to footballers to tell their story. But Lauryn's appearance on Celebs Go Dating is likely to delay any other TV work.\n\nLast month Lauryn also hinted she could be moving to Dubai in the coming months with her two children. She asked her fans on instagram if Dubai was a good place to live with children.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_jefferies@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mark Jefferies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebs_Go_Dating", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celebs Go Dating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E4 (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestbury,_Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prestbury, Cheshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prestbury, Cheshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber Relationships", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33065372.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EXCLUSIVE-BUILD-Fresh-headache-for-Kyle-Walker.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666456", "eventUri": "eng-9666456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Prince William cut a sophisticated appearance in a dark coloured suit and white shirt. England are set to face Denmark in their second Euro 2024 match in Group C - and if they win, it will send them through to the knockout stages.\n\nHowever, under the leadership of Gareth Southgate, England put on, what has been described as an unconvincing performance against Serbia last weekend. And Denmark are said to be a tougher opponent as their side includes Manchester United's Christian Eriksen and Rasmus Hojlund. Elsewhere, it looks as though England player Kyle Walker is set to face further humiliation amid the football matches as his former fling Lauryn Goodman is to appear on a dating show.\n\nEarlier this year, it emerged that Kyle had fathered a second child with Lauryn while he was with his wife Annie Kilner. Both Annie and Kyle share four sons, Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, Reign, five, and baby son Rezon, who was born in April. And while they made a pact to put his infidelity behind them, Lauryn's appearance on Celebs Go Dating will do little to let things settle. After signing the deal, the reality TV star is also thought to have agreed to discuss her previous fling with Kyle in full detail on the E4 show. One TV insider said Lauryn is \"only going on the show to have another dig at Kyle\", which will undoubtedly keep her in the spotlight.\n\nAnother source told the Mirror: \"Lauryn going on the show is a big step and shows Kyle and what happened with them is very much in the past. She is looking forward to the dating aspect. That said you can guarantee Kyle's ears will be burning when they film the show as his name will no doubt come up plenty of times. Lauren is excited to go on the show and just wants to have some fun, but if she can meet a new man on the TV show or a potential boyfriend that will be a bonus.\" If Lauryn goes ahead with her appearance, filming is likely to take place in the summer.\n\nThe mum of two, was reportedly meant to be attending the game but felt it would draw too much attention away from Kyle and England's performance. However, a source told The Sun on Sunday, her decision was made at the last minute. They said: \"She knew the focus would turn to her and she would be blamed by fans if they didn't win, or if Kyle played badly. Going to Germany is not about some daft WAG war, it is about being a good parent.\"\n\nLauryn first got pregnant when Kyle was on a break from Annie in 2019, with their son Kairo being born the following year. His second child with Lauryn, a daughter, was conceived in October 2022 and, in December last year, Lauryn revealed the news of her pregnancy to Annie - who was pregnant with her fourth child.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucretia_munro@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lucretia Munro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ed Sheeran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E4 (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebs_Go_Dating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celebs Go Dating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33074925.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-20062024-xsltx-Fussball-EM-2024-Dnemark-England-emspor-vl-Snger-und-Weltstar-Ed-Sheera.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666456", "eventUri": "eng-9666456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The couple reunited and married in 2022, but he then fathered his second child, born in 2023, with Lauryn. He apologised for causing his childhood sweetheart hurt.\n\nAnnie, 33, recently gave birth to her fourth child with Kyle, but the couple's current relationship status is unclear. She is currently supporting him in Germany as England plays in the group stages.\n\nBack in the UK, Lauryn is said to have embraced her single status and signed up for Celebs Go Dating - the reality show that sees famous faces going on dates set up by an agency, and undergoing therapy sessions with expert Paul Carrick Brunson, Anna Williamson, and Dr Tara Suwinyattichaiporn, to try to ensure healthy connections.\n\n'She is quite a sensational signing for the show, not least because she now has a huge profile - and she's one of the country's best-known singletons now,' a TV insider told The Sun.\n\nThey added that while everyone participating in the series has an interesting backstory, they consider Lauryn's private life to be one of the most interesting.\n\nLauryn would be joining popstar Jamelia, Love Island's Chris Taylor, Googlebox's Stephen Lustig-Webb, Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan, and Married At First Sight's Ella Morgan.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun in January 2024, Manchester City footballer Kyle apologised for his affairs: 'What I've done is horrible and I take full responsibility.\n\n'I made idiot choices and idiot decisions. I can't begin to think or imagine what Annie is going through. I've tried to ask her but there's pain and hurt.\n\n'The man that's meant to love, care and be there for her, did this.'\n\nHe added: 'My actions have caused a lot of pain to a lot of people. I'm sorry because, as a family, this isn't meant to happen.'\n\nWhile Lauryn has also spoken about the decisions they have made.\n\n'None of this has been my finest hour, but I'm not the first and I won't be the last woman to have ever slept with a married man -- and he did completely poison me,' she told the Daily Mail.\n\n'I won't get into the private conversations I have had with Annie, but she did tell me \u00adinitially she felt we were both victims of his manipulative and controlling behaviour, and at times we have got along quite well, apologised to one another and had a mutual understanding.'\n\nLauryn is said to be flying out to Germany this weekend to watch an England match with her young son.\n\nThey won't be alone, The Sun claims, as a camera crew could follow her for a new documentary.\n\nAnnie, who shares sons Roman, 11, Riaan, seven, Reign, five, and a two-month-old son Rezon with Kyle, posted on Instagram in January that the pair were taking a break.\n\n'I have decided to take some time away from Kyle,' she wrote.\n\n'I do not wish to comment on the position any further. For now, I ask that the privacy of myself and our three young children is respected during this difficult time.'\n\nInsiders say Kyle has been desperately trying to get their marriage back on track.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Channel 4 and representatives of Lauryn Goodman for comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

An expert has waded in on their bond and how they're supporting each other through the Euros, including why \"Coleen will never let Wayne humiliate her again\".\n\nColeen, 38, has been the Queen of the WAGs since she was thrown into the spotlight after meeting her Manchester United husband Wayne Rooney, 38, when she was just 16 years old. The couple tied the knot in 2008 and have four children together, Kai, Klay, Kit, and Cass.\n\nBut it hasn't been easy for the famous pair who have been forced to put on a united front and work through some rather turbulent times, from cheating claims to sex workers, with their life so heavily in the public eye. Another WAG who has been dealt a heavy blow when it comes to difficult times is Annie Kilner, 32, the wife of Manchester City star Kyle Walker, 34.\n\nThe couple first met in their hometown of Sheffield when she was 15 and he was 17 - today they share four children, Roman, Riaan, Reign and Rezon. But the joyous occasion of welcoming their fourth child was dampened after reports emerged that Kyle had fathered a second child with reality star Lauryn Goodman, 33.\n\nThe footballer first had a fling with the influencer during a split from Annie in 2019, which saw Lauryn fall pregnant. Lauryn gave birth to son Kairo, while, Annie took Kyle back and the couple tied the knot in 2022.\n\nHowever, Kyle and Lauryn reconnected, which saw Lauryn conceive their second child in October 2022 while Kyle was in London recovering from a groin injury. Lauryn then revealed to Annie, who was heavily pregnant with her and Kyle's fourth child at the time, that her daughter was Kyle's.\n\nAfter finding out about the alleged infidelity, Annie and Kyle parted ways at the end of last year before welcoming their son in April this year. Despite their split, Annie was spotted with their children supporting the footballer in Germany during the Euros for a match against England and Serbia.\n\nThe continuous support is something Coleen can no doubt relate to, having stood by her man on countless occasions, despite also being hit with spiralling infidelity rumours. And it seems Coleen and Annie have sparked up a close bond and have their very own 'marriage pact'.\n\nA source told OK! \"Over the past six months, Coleen has really been helping and supporting Annie Kilner as she deals with trying to salvage her marriage and raising four boys, including a newborn baby.\n\n\"They've known each other for a while as their husbands are friends and their kids go to the same school but Coleen has really been a shoulder for Annie to cry on as she knows what it's like and has been offering advice.\"\n\nReports have suggested that Lauryn could attend the Euros in Germany to support Kyle, which the source said has left \"Annie terrified.\" Offering support to her friend, Coleen has reportedly told Annie that she \"must stay strong\" and has even offered \"to go out to Germany to support Annie.\"\n\nThe source continued: \"Coleen can fight when she has to and the fact that Lauryn is close to Rebekah Vardy has just made Coleen all the more determined to get justice and the rest of the WAGs agree.\n\n\"Annie has always been a big support to her and has never judged Coleen for her choices and Coleen has vowed to do the same for Annie. They are in such a strange situation because not only are they WAGs, but they both know what it's like to be so publicly hurt by their partners and be judged for their decisions.\n\n\"But they both want to put their children first and do what is right for their boys.\" Speaking of Coleen's own marriage woes, the source told us: \"All of this with Annie and Kyle brings up horrible memories for Coleen and she knows how hard it can be. Fortunately, Wayne and Coleen have come out the other side and are in a very happy place but Coleen knows they might not be able to survive another scandal like this. She's seen the pain and humiliation that Annie is going through and she won't let it happen again.\"\n\nColeen and Wayne were first rocked by rumours in 2004 when it emerged that teenage Wayne had been visiting prostitutes and paying for sex behind his then-girlfriend's back. The couple were forced to cope with the fallout as the world watched and Coleen stood by her man.\n\nBut in another heartwrenching blow, it was revealed in 2010 that he had reportedly returned to his old ways, visiting sex workers and taking part in a threesome while Coleen was pregnant with their firstborn, Kai. In 2017, their relationship was put through the wringer once again when Wayne was pulled over by police for drink-driving and he was in the car with estate agent Laura Simpson.\n\nDespite some very well-publicised lows during their marriage, Coleen has stuck by Wayne and is adamant there have also been plenty of highs that may not have garnered as much attention during their relationship. \"I do have a private life and we are real people, which is sometimes overlooked,\" she said on the Amazon Prime documentary Rooney.\n\n\"We do have worries, troubles and obstacles in life we tackle and go through without anyone knowing and we also have fantastic fun times making memories with our loved ones without people knowing.\"\n\nOn her decision to stay in her marriage then, Coleen previously said she can forgive his actions, but will never forget. \"It's my decision,\" she explained at the time. \"Do I love Wayne? Yes I do. I'm not saying everything is fine and forgotten about, but we are as good as can be at this point, I'm not the type of person to put a show on and say we're all loved-up... I'm just real.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_jones@ok.co.uk", "name": "Amy Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAGs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WAGs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleen_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coleen Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Vardy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebekah Vardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threesome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Threesome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article33063923.ece/alternates/s1200/3_social-template2023-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666456", "eventUri": "eng-9666456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

While the result wasn't ideal, you'd have thought they would have been a little more joyous, at least for their children.'\n\nAmong the more cheerful looking WAGs were goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's wife Megan Davison and Aine Kennedy, who is dating Conor Gallagher.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Gallagher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Gallagher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/23/86392351-0-image-m-9_1718922368934.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666456", "eventUri": "eng-9666456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

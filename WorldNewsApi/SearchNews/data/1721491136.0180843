Labor Senator Varun Ghosh asked Dr de Toca, who led the foreign affairs delegation in Genava, if Australia\u2019s sovereignty would be impacted by the IHR\u2019s or the proposed treaty. In response Dr. de Toca said, \u201cno, categorically no.\u201d Dr. de Toca explained the WHO is a member state organisation, which means that it\u2019s the countries that constitute part of it who determine how it works. \u201cThese amendments, or the International Health Regulations, are a binding legal instrument if a country decides to adopt them,\u201d he said. He said a 12 month process will now kick in where countries are able to, if they choose, ratify the instrument or they can communicate with the WHO that they do not intend to be a party to the amendments. \u201cThat follows the usual process that we have in Australia\u2014scrutiny through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and then a discussion at parliament,\u201d Dr. de Toca said. \u201cOur sovereignty is in no way impacted, and in a way it is even enhanced because we\u2019re actively engaging in a system that acknowledges that no-one is safe unless everyone is safe.\u201d Gain of function research involves modifying viruses in a lab to study how they evolve and cause disease. The research can be controversial due to the risk of accidental release of genetically modified viruses. Coalition Senator Matt Canavan asked Dr. de Toca in Senate estimates if the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations help to deal with the \u201cissue of gain-of-function research.\u201d Dr. de Toca responded there was nothing specifically in the regulations that tackled the issue. \u201cThe International Health Regulations\u2014there was some discussion about tech transfer. Those elements will be discussed in the pandemic agreement, but there is no specific mention of that particular type of research,\u201d he said. It is the first time in decades that Australia has had a minister at the World Health Assembly. \u201cThe outcome of those processes was that the World Health Organization adopted, by consensus, a package of amendments to the International Health Regulations and also agreed on a process to finalise the work towards a pandemic agreement,\u201d he said. The Australian Ambassador for global health said having just come back from Geneva, he was \u201cvery excited to talk about this work.\u201d \u201cThis is exciting. It\u2019s a triumph of multiculturalism. Despite our best efforts, diseases know no borders,\u201d he said. He said Australia has been very actively engaged in this process, with an overarching negotiating mandate to work on improving equity, detection, reporting, and sharing of information. The new regulations include a definition of pandemic and improved systems for countries to share information. \u201cUp until these amendments come into effect, if a country is not cooperating with WHO and WHO has information on a potential risk of an epidemic, the WHO wasn\u2019t able to share it,\u201d Dr. de Toca said. This new authority shall be \u201caccessible for communications\u201d with WHO contact points at all times, according to the regulations. The state parties shall also take measures to implement this national authority, including \u201cadjusting their domestic legislative and/or administrative arrangements.\u201d", "summary": "Australian Ambassador for Global Health Dr. Lucas de Toca said 'no' when asked if the proposed pandemic treaty deals with gain of function research.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/australias-sovereignty-not-affected-by-who-health-treaty-global-health-ambassador-5669482", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/11/06/id5524096-shutterstock_1670462338-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:16:56", "author": "Monica O\u2019shea", "authors": ["Monica O\u2019shea"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.005}

However, the team faced a sweep by eventual NBA champions Denver in last year's Western Conference final and suffered elimination in five games by the Nuggets in this season's first round.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate Darvin's efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons, including last year's remarkable run to the Western Conference finals,\" Lakers vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka said\n\n\"While this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season. This organization will remain unwavering in its commitment to deliver championship-caliber basketball to Lakers fans around the world.\"\n\nApart from the impending decision on their next head coach, the Lakers also grapple with uncertainty surrounding the future of superstar LeBron James. A four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, James has the option to opt out of his contract for the next season.\n\n\"I've seen, heard a lot of reports about my future. I said it last night and I'll say it again. I do not know yet as I'm only thinking about spending time with my family & friends! When I know after speaking with the fam, my counsel as well as my representation about it then you guys will know. Until then. Love,\" James tweeted\n\nJames has expressed his desire to play alongside his son Bronny next season, who has decided to enter next month's NBA Draft.\n\nAt the age of 39, four-time NBA champion James remains a formidable presence on the court, leading the Lakers with averages of 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game.\n\nDuring the season, the Lakers achieved a record of 47-35, securing a victory in the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament, now known as the NBA Cup. They secured a playoff spot against Denver by defeating New Orleans in the play-in round.\n\nJames appeared in 71 games this season, while his All-Star teammate Anthony Davis played 76, marking their highest combined number of games since joining forces with the Lakers in 2018. Davis averaged 24.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 1.2 steals per game.\n\nBoth James and Davis have contract opt-out clauses, and if they were to depart, it would leave the Lakers facing a significant rebuilding phase.\n\nHam, a former NBA forward who won a championship with Detroit in 2004, previously served as a Lakers assistant coach from 2011 to 2013.\n\nAfter four seasons as an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks, where he contributed to their 2021 NBA title, Ham was appointed as Lakers head coach in June 2022, succeeding the dismissed Frank Vogel.\n\nThe Lakers encountered challenges in Ham's first season, but a mid-season overhaul, including the addition of Rui Hachimura and D'Angelo Russell in supporting roles, propelled the team to the 2023 playoffs, where they eliminated Memphis and Golden State before ultimately falling to the Nuggets.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianobservernews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nigerian Observer"},

Smith slams Lakers for letting Darvin Ham go, points to 'problematic' rosters", "body": "The LA Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham right after the team got bounced in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs. Although there was wide anticipation that Ham would lose his job after his team's early exit, NBA analyst Stephen A. Smith thinks the Lakers made a mistake.\n\nThe ESPN analyst appeared on First Take and shared his opinion on Ham's firing. When asked if the Lakers should have fired Darvin Ham, Smith vehemently said that the decision was wrong.\n\n\"[Darvin Ham] got scr*wed. It was the wrong decision.\"\n\nIn Ham's defense, Smith added that rather than looking at Ham, the Lakers should look at their team's construction. According to Smith, the Lakers didn't have good players who could shoot and defend on the floor. He said the team was never built to be successful, especially after the Russell Westbrook trade, which sent away key players.\n\n\"My problem is look at the roster itself. It is problematic,\" Smith added.\n\nTo credit Ham, Smith also added that despite having a weak team, the Lakers have been successful with Ham as coach. Despite their late-season struggles last season, he took the Lakers to the conference finals. According to Smith, getting defeated by a championship team should not get Darvin Ham fired.\n\nLeBron James was unhappy with Darvin Ham limiting his minutes in regular season\n\nThere is not just one reason that might have amounted to Darvin Ham getting fired as Lakers head coach. Given how big of a standard the Lakers have set for themselves, anything less than the NBA Finals or championship falls short of expectations.\n\nHowever, it was not just the high expectations that ended Ham's job. A lot of players, starting with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, were allegedly unhappy with his coaching style.

Russell's actions occurred on the court immediately following the Lakers' 108-106 loss to the Denver Nuggets on April 29 at Ball Arena.\"\n\nRussell was a highly talked about player throughout this series, as his play bounced between two extremes on a game to game basis. Either red hot from three or unable to buy a shot entirely, Russell was a different player from game to game for the Lakers, which certainly contributed to their five-game first round exit.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what the Lakers and Russell decide to do this summer as it pertains to their partnership moving forward. The guard has had some great moments in Los Angeles, but has also held them back at times with his inconsistent play.

Once they get there, though, Ham looked out of his depth going up against Nuggets head coach Michael Malone, who routinely had answers for any adjustments that were made.\n\nWith reports surfacing that Ham also lost the locker room's trust, it was only a matter of time until the decision to fire him would be made.\n\nDespite how his tenure ended in Los Angeles, though, Ham is expected to be head coaching candidate elsewhere in the league, via Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:\n\n\"This was a decision essentially made days ago if not late in the season once the Lakers did not advance past Denver.

For the longest time, it felt like LeBron James had the closest chance of staving off time the inevitable. Over the last few years, though... the Los Angeles Lakers star's play has been slowly but surely declining in the last few years. He's still pretty good, but if we're being honest... the days of super-LeBron are long gone by now.\n\nAt this point in his career, LeBron James has to be considering retirement at this point... right? The Lakers star is 40 years old, playing for over 20 years in the league. At least one former NBA legend wants LeBron to retire... but not for malicious reasons. Barkley does not want James to go through the path most aging legends go.\n\n\"I hope he retires soon because I hated the way I retired... Your ego says you can still do it... I don't want to see any great players play when they're past their prime.\"\n\nSo many old legends retire way past their expiration date, if that makes sense. Lakers fans don't even need to look that far. Kobe Bryant's final game was electric, but fans forget that before that game, Mamba was basically a shell of himself. Countless other stars go down this path.\n\nNow granted, LeBron is far from late-stage Kobe at this point in his career. He's still an effective focal point for a team that's consistently in the playoffs. Chuck also isn't implying that the Lakers star retire now or in the next year. It's just that Chuck seems to not want to see LeBron play bad basketball just because he thinks he can once his play inevitably declines.\n\nLakers' direction for the future\n\nAfter the disappointing end to their 2024 season, the Lakers' future is in disarray. There are questions about whether LeBron will stay with the team or not next season. With Darvin Ham out of the picture, it's fair to wonder if other players might leave as well. D'Angelo Russell is one of the many Lakers that could be out of the picture next year.\n\nAt the very least, the Lakers seem to be consistent playoff players year in and year out. When you have a team with as much history as LA, though, a postseason isn't enough. The closest LA got to winning a championship after their bubble run was last year, when they went all the way to the Western Conference Finals. Unfortunately, they got swept that year by the eventual champions Denver Nuggets.\n\nWith the highs of their success in 2023, the Lakers came into this season with high expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations quickly proved to be too high. Between the insanely competitive West in 2024 and the Lakers just crashing back to Earth, the team just couldn't string together a consistent winning streak.

With the Lakers' recent first-round departure from the playoffs, falling 4-1 to the Denver Nuggets, it's time to reflect on LeBron's journey with the team.\n\nFrom championship highs to disappointing lows, this era has been a rollercoaster of emotions and results. In this article, we'll dive into LeBron's tenure with the Lakers, examining the impact of his leadership on and off the court, the team's playoff performances, and the overall direction of the franchise under his star power.\n\n2018-19 NBA Season - Missed Playoffs\n\nRegular Season Record: 37-45 (10th in the Western Conference)\n\nLeBron James' inaugural season with the Los Angeles Lakers marked a significant shift for both the player and the franchise, though it didn't quite go as planned. James, who had reached the NBA Finals eight consecutive times with the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers, faced new challenges in the Western Conference. The Lakers, filled with young talents and high expectations, struggled to find consistent chemistry and were plagued by injuries throughout the season. LeBron himself was not immune; he missed a career-high 27 games due to a groin injury suffered on Christmas Day, which significantly impacted the team's performance and playoff hopes.\n\nWhen he was on the court, LeBron still performed at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game. Despite his efforts, the Lakers often looked outmatched and out of sync, particularly in clutch situations. The team's defense also suffered, finishing the season ranked 21st in defensive rating.\n\nThis season didn't live up to the hype surrounding LeBron's big move to LA. Missing the playoffs was a rare miss for LeBron and really highlighted the struggles and growing pains the Lakers went through.\n\nRegular Season Record: 52-19 (1st in the Western Conference)\n\nLeBron James' second year with the Los Angeles Lakers turned the narrative completely around from his first season. The key offseason move that brought Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and multiple draft picks transformed the Lakers into a powerhouse. The synergy between LeBron and Davis was evident from the start, making the Lakers a top contender. They finished the regular season leading the Western Conference and ranked third overall in the league.\n\nHowever, the season faced unprecedented disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a suspension of play in March. The league resumed in July in a bubble at Disney World, where the Lakers found their stride and dominated the competition. Throughout the regular season, LeBron put up impressive numbers, averaging 25.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and led the league with 10.2 assists per game, showcasing his versatility and leadership.\n\nOnce in the playoffs, the Lakers showcased their dominance by beating the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, overcoming the Houston Rockets in the semifinals, and defeating the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. Each series highlighted the Lakers' unmatched depth and LeBron's critical role in pivotal moments.\n\nIn the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, LeBron's experience was invaluable. He averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game across the six-game series. His performance not only led the Lakers to their 17th NBA title but also earned him the Finals MVP, marking his fourth Finals MVP award. This victory tied the Lakers with the Boston Celtics for the most championships in NBA history.\n\nThe 2019-20 season was a resounding triumph. Capturing the NBA championship in one of the most challenging seasons ever, due to the circumstances of the pandemic and the bubble environment, was a testament to the team's resilience and LeBron's leadership. His ability to perform at an MVP level in the playoffs and lead his team to victory under such unique and stressful conditions secured a top grade for the season. This year not only restored the Lakers as a premier franchise but also cemented LeBron's legacy as one of the all-time greats in basketball history.\n\nRegular Season Record: 42-30 (7th in the Western Conference)\n\nFollowing their championship season, expectations remained high for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. Nonetheless, the 2020-21 season was fraught with challenges, most notably injuries. Both LeBron James and Anthony Davis faced significant time on the sidelines due to health issues; LeBron missed 27 games due to a high ankle sprain, and Davis was out for a large part of the season with calf and Achilles tendon injuries. These setbacks disrupted the team's rhythm and chemistry, significantly affecting their performance and seeding going into the playoffs.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the Lakers managed to secure the seventh seed in the Western Conference through the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Golden State Warriors in a tightly contested game. LeBron's leadership and a crucial long-range three-pointer in the final minute were pivotal in clinching the game.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers faced the Phoenix Suns, who were led by the dynamic duo of Devin Booker and Chris Paul. The series exposed the Lakers' vulnerabilities, particularly their depth issues and the ongoing fitness concerns of their star players. After taking an initial series lead, the Lakers struggled to maintain consistency, and with Davis re-aggravating his groin injury in Game 4, their fate was all but sealed. The Suns capitalized on this, taking the series 4-2.\n\nLeBron, despite the challenges, averaged 23.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game during the series, showcasing his all-around abilities but falling short of his usual dominant playoff impact.\n\nThe 2020-21 season ended in disappointment for the Lakers, marking a stark contrast to their championship run just a year earlier. Injuries played a significant role, and the team's inability to consistently perform at a high level without their key stars highlighted the need for greater depth and durability. The season underscored the limits of relying heavily on stars who were battling through significant physical challenges.\n\nIn the 2021-22 season, the Los Angeles Lakers made a significant offseason move aiming to reshape their roster around LeBron James and Anthony Davis by acquiring Russell Westbrook from the Washington Wizards. This trade, which sent Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and a future draft pick to Washington, was intended to form a new \"big three.\" The Lakers anticipated that Westbrook's high energy and ability to produce triple-doubles would mesh well with LeBron and Davis, adding a new dynamic to their team.\n\nHowever, the season did not unfold as the Lakers had hoped. Integrating Westbrook into the lineup proved challenging, with notable issues in on-court fit and chemistry. Westbrook's ball-dominant style clashed with LeBron's playmaking role, leading to disjointed offensive performances. Moreover, Anthony Davis struggled with injuries throughout the season, significantly limiting his contribution and impacting the team's overall performance.\n\nThe Lakers faced difficulties in establishing consistency, with the team struggling to adapt to the new roster dynamics. Their defensive performance was lackluster, and the team often appeared out of sync, particularly in crucial moments of games. These issues contributed to a disappointing regular season, where the Lakers finished with a 33-49 record, missing the playoffs entirely and ending up 11th in the Western Conference.\n\nLeBron, despite these challenges, maintained robust averages of 30.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 6.2 assists per game, showcasing his enduring skill and leadership under trying circumstances.\n\nThe 2021-22 season was a significant disappointment for the Lakers, failing to meet the heightened expectations set by the arrival of Westbrook and the existing star power of LeBron and Davis. The team's inability to gel and the persistent injury issues highlighted serious flaws in both roster construction and strategic planning. This season underscored the need for a thorough reassessment of the Lakers' approach to building a supportive and effective team around LeBron.\n\nThe 2022-23 NBA season marked a significant turnaround for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. After a series of roster adjustments following the departure of Russell Westbrook, the Lakers aimed to build a more cohesive unit around LeBron. This year, they achieved a level of team synergy that had been missing in previous seasons, leading to improved results.\n\nThroughout the regular season, the Lakers experienced ups and downs but ultimately secured a more respectable record of 43-39, showing progress from their past struggles. LeBron James continued to defy age-related expectations, leading the team with impressive averages of 28.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 6.8 assists. His leadership on and off the court was instrumental in navigating the team through the competitive Western Conference.\n\nDuring the playoffs, the Lakers first faced the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round. They secured a series win against the Grizzlies with a 4-2 record, advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals, where they faced a formidable Golden State Warriors team. The Lakers managed to eliminate the Warriors in six games, showing strong performances and clutch plays that highlighted their potential and resilience under pressure.\n\nHowever, their journey ended in the Western Conference Finals, where they faced the Denver Nuggets. The Lakers were swept by the Nuggets in a 4-0 series. Despite the sweep, reaching the Western Conference Finals marked a notable achievement for the team, especially considering their performance in the regular season and their journey through the playoffs.\n\nLeBron James played a pivotal role throughout the Lakers' playoff run, with standout performances that included scoring, playmaking, and leadership on the court. The team's progress to the Western Conference Finals, despite being eventually outmatched by the Nuggets, was a testament to their improved cohesion and strategic adjustments made throughout the season\n\nThe 2022-23 season was a step in the right direction for the Lakers. While they did not achieve the ultimate goal of an NBA championship, the progress made from a play-in berth to a Western Conference Finals appearance was commendable. The season reaffirmed LeBron's status as an elite player capable of leading a team deep into the playoffs. It also underscored the need for the Lakers to continue refining their roster to support LeBron in the remaining years of his career, aiming for sustained success and possibly another championship run.\n\nThe 2023-24 NBA season for the Los Angeles Lakers was marked by improvements and heightened expectations after their previous Western Conference Finals appearance. The Lakers finished the regular season with a record of 47-35, placing them seventh in the Western Conference.\n\nLeBron James continued to showcase his all-around skills, averaging 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, demonstrating his enduring impact on the court. Anthony Davis also played a crucial role, with 24.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers faced the Denver Nuggets in the first round. Despite their efforts and the high hopes pinned on them, the Lakers were eliminated in a tightly contested series that went to five games. Their season ended with a narrow 108-106 loss in Game 5 with a Jamal Murray game-winning shot, underlining the challenges they still faced in matchups against top-tier teams.\n\nThe 2023-24 season showed promise and was a step up from the previous seasons, evidenced by the Lakers' solid regular season performance and the competitive nature of their playoff games. However, the first-round exit was a reminder of the gaps that still exist between the Lakers and the championship contenders. The playoff outcome emphasized the need for ongoing adjustments and perhaps a deeper bench to support their key players during critical moments of high-stakes matches.\n\nLeBron James' stint with the Lakers has been nothing short of transformative. Over the past six years, not only did he clinch an NBA championship in the 2019-20 season, breaking a decade-long drought for the Lakers, but he also led the team to an In-Season Tournament victory in 2023-24. These accomplishments highlight a period of resurgence for the Lakers, firmly re-establishing them as contenders in the league.\n\nThroughout his tenure, LeBron has been the linchpin for the Lakers, melding young talents with experienced players and consistently delivering high-performance play. He adapted to different roles as needed, guiding the team through both regular seasons and playoffs with his strategic play and leadership. Even with challenges like injuries and significant roster changes, his ability to inspire and elevate his teammates has been a constant.\n\nIt's worth noting that LeBron's era with the Lakers isn't over yet. Although he might opt out of his player option and become a free agent, signs point to him likely staying with the team. This ongoing journey means LeBron still has chapters to write in his Lakers story, promising more opportunities to bolster his already impressive legacy.\n\nBy any measure, LeBron's impact on the Lakers deserves an 'A'. His time in LA has not only added another championship banner but has also rejuvenated the franchise, keeping them in the championship conversation and setting high standards for the team's future campaigns.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fran_leiva@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Fran Leiva", "type": "author",

Quite a few on their roster could be headed to free agency in the summer and about 30,000 fans were asked who they'd want to see back. Quite shockingly, 13 percent of them did not want LeBron James to be re-signed.\n\nYou do have to wonder what on earth was going through the minds of that 13 percent. If LeBron, who has a player option worth $51.4 million for 2024-25, leaves the Lakers this summer, any chance of them winning a championship in the near future goes with him.\n\nJames was at worst their second-best player in this 2023-24 campaign and ended the regular season with averages of 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.3 assists, 1.3 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game. The 39-year-old played well in that first-round series against the Denver Nuggets as well and the Lakers need him back.\n\nAs for the rest, Christie being that high isn't all that surprising. The Lakers fans have held him in very high regard and were disappointed that former head coach Darvin Ham didn't play him at all against the Nuggets. Christie will be a restricted free agent this summer and I would expect the Lakers to bring him back.\n\nI am a bit surprised that Prince got that much support, considering how much stick he got from the fanbase throughout the season. The 30-year-old was the Lakers' best player off the bench against the Nuggets and that perhaps played a role there.\n\nWhile Prince played well against Denver, for the most part, Russell did not. The 28-year-old showed once again, that he cannot be relied upon in the playoffs. Had the fans been asked to vote when the regular season ended, Russell certainly would have gotten a lot more love.\n\nHayes was the only other player to be above 50 percent and I was taken aback by that. The big man had his moments in the second half of the campaign, but I think the Lakers need someone better than him in that backup role.\n\nAs for the three under 50 percent, I think the only surprise there was that 40 percent of the voters actually wanted Dinwiddie back. He was so ineffective after the Lakers signed him mid-season and I don't believe he should be re-signed.\n\nNBA Fans React To The Fan Votes\n\nThe fan polling results went viral on X and NBA fans had some interesting reactions to it.\n\nOne said LeBron should have been at 100 percent.\n\nA fan can't believe how many people want Russell back.\n\nOne felt 40 percent for Dinwiddie was far too high.\n\nA fan wildly claimed that 55 percent of Lakers fans want to lose, based on the voting for Russell.\n\nOne was shocked that so many wanted Taurean Prince back.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how many of them are brought back. It has been reported that the Lakers are open to offering LeBron a $164 million extension and drafting Bronny James, so they want the 20-time All-Star to stay. As for the rest, only time will tell.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gautam_varier@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Gautam Varier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvin_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elvin Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurean_Prince", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taurean Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQwMzIyMzQ5NDQyNDU5/441265000_799722355077597_3671833192889276136_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

With the Lakers' recent first-round departure from the playoffs, falling 4-1 to the Denver Nuggets, it's time to reflect on LeBron's journey with the team.\n\nFrom championship highs to disappointing lows, this era has been a rollercoaster of emotions and results. In this article, we'll dive into LeBron's tenure with the Lakers, examining the impact of his leadership on and off the court, the team's playoff performances, and the overall direction of the franchise under his star power.\n\n2018-19 NBA Season - Missed Playoffs\n\nRegular Season Record: 37-45 (10th in the Western Conference)\n\nLeBron James' inaugural season with the Los Angeles Lakers marked a significant shift for both the player and the franchise, though it didn't quite go as planned. James, who had reached the NBA Finals eight consecutive times with the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers, faced new challenges in the Western Conference. The Lakers, filled with young talents and high expectations, struggled to find consistent chemistry and were plagued by injuries throughout the season. LeBron himself was not immune; he missed a career-high 27 games due to a groin injury suffered on Christmas Day, which significantly impacted the team's performance and playoff hopes.\n\nWhen he was on the court, LeBron still performed at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game. Despite his efforts, the Lakers often looked outmatched and out of sync, particularly in clutch situations. The team's defense also suffered, finishing the season ranked 21st in defensive rating.\n\nThis season didn't live up to the hype surrounding LeBron's big move to LA. Missing the playoffs was a rare miss for LeBron and really highlighted the struggles and growing pains the Lakers went through.\n\nGrade: C\n\n2019-20 NBA Season - NBA Champions\n\nRegular Season Record: 52-19 (1st in the Western Conference)\n\nLeBron James' second year with the Los Angeles Lakers turned the narrative completely around from his first season. The key offseason move that brought Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, and multiple draft picks transformed the Lakers into a powerhouse. The synergy between LeBron and Davis was evident from the start, making the Lakers a top contender. They finished the regular season leading the Western Conference and ranked third overall in the league.\n\nHowever, the season faced unprecedented disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a suspension of play in March. The league resumed in July in a bubble at Disney World, where the Lakers found their stride and dominated the competition. Throughout the regular season, LeBron put up impressive numbers, averaging 25.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and led the league with 10.2 assists per game, showcasing his versatility and leadership.\n\nOnce in the playoffs, the Lakers showcased their dominance by beating the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, overcoming the Houston Rockets in the semifinals, and defeating the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. Each series highlighted the Lakers' unmatched depth and LeBron's critical role in pivotal moments.\n\nIn the NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, LeBron's experience was invaluable. He averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game across the six-game series. His performance not only led the Lakers to their 17th NBA title but also earned him the Finals MVP, marking his fourth Finals MVP award. This victory tied the Lakers with the Boston Celtics for the most championships in NBA history.\n\nThe 2019-20 season was a resounding triumph. Capturing the NBA championship in one of the most challenging seasons ever, due to the circumstances of the pandemic and the bubble environment, was a testament to the team's resilience and LeBron's leadership. His ability to perform at an MVP level in the playoffs and lead his team to victory under such unique and stressful conditions secured a top grade for the season. This year not only restored the Lakers as a premier franchise but also cemented LeBron's legacy as one of the all-time greats in basketball history.\n\nGrade: A+\n\n2020-21 NBA Season - First Round Exit\n\nRegular Season Record: 42-30 (7th in the Western Conference)\n\nFollowing their championship season, expectations remained high for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. Nonetheless, the 2020-21 season was fraught with challenges, most notably injuries. Both LeBron James and Anthony Davis faced significant time on the sidelines due to health issues; LeBron missed 27 games due to a high ankle sprain, and Davis was out for a large part of the season with calf and Achilles tendon injuries. These setbacks disrupted the team's rhythm and chemistry, significantly affecting their performance and seeding going into the playoffs.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the Lakers managed to secure the seventh seed in the Western Conference through the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Golden State Warriors in a tightly contested game. LeBron's leadership and a crucial long-range three-pointer in the final minute were pivotal in clinching the game.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers faced the Phoenix Suns, who were led by the dynamic duo of Devin Booker and Chris Paul. The series exposed the Lakers' vulnerabilities, particularly their depth issues and the ongoing fitness concerns of their star players. After taking an initial series lead, the Lakers struggled to maintain consistency, and with Davis re-aggravating his groin injury in Game 4, their fate was all but sealed. The Suns capitalized on this, taking the series 4-2.\n\nLeBron, despite the challenges, averaged 23.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game during the series, showcasing his all-around abilities but falling short of his usual dominant playoff impact.\n\nThe 2020-21 season ended in disappointment for the Lakers, marking a stark contrast to their championship run just a year earlier. Injuries played a significant role, and the team's inability to consistently perform at a high level without their key stars highlighted the need for greater depth and durability. The season underscored the limits of relying heavily on stars who were battling through significant physical challenges.\n\nGrade: C\n\nRelated: The Lakers Coaching Dream Scenario With Tyronn Lue, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo And Phil Handy\n\n2021-22 NBA Season - Missed Playoffs\n\nRegular Season Record: 33-49 (11th in the Western Conference)\n\nIn the 2021-22 season, the Los Angeles Lakers made a significant offseason move aiming to reshape their roster around LeBron James and Anthony Davis by acquiring Russell Westbrook from the Washington Wizards. This trade, which sent Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and a future draft pick to Washington, was intended to form a new \"big three.\" The Lakers anticipated that Westbrook's high energy and ability to produce triple-doubles would mesh well with LeBron and Davis, adding a new dynamic to their team.\n\nHowever, the season did not unfold as the Lakers had hoped. Integrating Westbrook into the lineup proved challenging, with notable issues in on-court fit and chemistry. Westbrook's ball-dominant style clashed with LeBron's playmaking role, leading to disjointed offensive performances. Moreover, Anthony Davis struggled with injuries throughout the season, significantly limiting his contribution and impacting the team's overall performance.\n\nThe Lakers faced difficulties in establishing consistency, with the team struggling to adapt to the new roster dynamics. Their defensive performance was lackluster, and the team often appeared out of sync, particularly in crucial moments of games. These issues contributed to a disappointing regular season, where the Lakers finished with a 33-49 record, missing the playoffs entirely and ending up 11th in the Western Conference.\n\nLeBron, despite these challenges, maintained robust averages of 30.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 6.2 assists per game, showcasing his enduring skill and leadership under trying circumstances.\n\nThe 2021-22 season was a significant disappointment for the Lakers, failing to meet the heightened expectations set by the arrival of Westbrook and the existing star power of LeBron and Davis. The team's inability to gel and the persistent injury issues highlighted serious flaws in both roster construction and strategic planning. This season underscored the need for a thorough reassessment of the Lakers' approach to building a supportive and effective team around LeBron.\n\nGrade: D\n\n2022-23 NBA Season - Western Conference Finals Exit\n\nRegular Season Record: 43-39 (7th in the Western Conference)\n\nThe 2022-23 NBA season marked a significant turnaround for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. After a series of roster adjustments following the departure of Russell Westbrook, the Lakers aimed to build a more cohesive unit around LeBron. This year, they achieved a level of team synergy that had been missing in previous seasons, leading to improved results.\n\nThroughout the regular season, the Lakers experienced ups and downs but ultimately secured a more respectable record of 43-39, showing progress from their past struggles. LeBron James continued to defy age-related expectations, leading the team with impressive averages of 28.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 6.8 assists. His leadership on and off the court was instrumental in navigating the team through the competitive Western Conference.\n\nDuring the playoffs, the Lakers first faced the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round. They secured a series win against the Grizzlies with a 4-2 record, advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals, where they faced a formidable Golden State Warriors team. The Lakers managed to eliminate the Warriors in six games, showing strong performances and clutch plays that highlighted their potential and resilience under pressure.\n\nHowever, their journey ended in the Western Conference Finals, where they faced the Denver Nuggets. The Lakers were swept by the Nuggets in a 4-0 series. Despite the sweep, reaching the Western Conference Finals marked a notable achievement for the team, especially considering their performance in the regular season and their journey through the playoffs.\n\nLeBron James played a pivotal role throughout the Lakers' playoff run, with standout performances that included scoring, playmaking, and leadership on the court. The team's progress to the Western Conference Finals, despite being eventually outmatched by the Nuggets, was a testament to their improved cohesion and strategic adjustments made throughout the season\n\nThe 2022-23 season was a step in the right direction for the Lakers. While they did not achieve the ultimate goal of an NBA championship, the progress made from a play-in berth to a Western Conference Finals appearance was commendable. The season reaffirmed LeBron's status as an elite player capable of leading a team deep into the playoffs. It also underscored the need for the Lakers to continue refining their roster to support LeBron in the remaining years of his career, aiming for sustained success and possibly another championship run.\n\nGrade: B+\n\n2023-24 NBA Season - First Round Exit\n\nRegular Season Record: 47-35 (7th in the Western Conference)\n\nThe 2023-24 NBA season for the Los Angeles Lakers was marked by improvements and heightened expectations after their previous Western Conference Finals appearance. The Lakers finished the regular season with a record of 47-35, placing them seventh in the Western Conference.\n\nLeBron James continued to showcase his all-around skills, averaging 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, demonstrating his enduring impact on the court. Anthony Davis also played a crucial role, with 24.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Lakers faced the Denver Nuggets in the first round. Despite their efforts and the high hopes pinned on them, the Lakers were eliminated in a tightly contested series that went to five games. Their season ended with a narrow 108-106 loss in Game 5 with a Jamal Murray game-winning shot, underlining the challenges they still faced in matchups against top-tier teams.\n\nThe 2023-24 season showed promise and was a step up from the previous seasons, evidenced by the Lakers' solid regular season performance and the competitive nature of their playoff games. However, the first-round exit was a reminder of the gaps that still exist between the Lakers and the championship contenders. The playoff outcome emphasized the need for ongoing adjustments and perhaps a deeper bench to support their key players during critical moments of high-stakes matches.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nOverall Grade Of LeBron's Lakers Era: A\n\nLeBron James' stint with the Lakers has been nothing short of transformative. Over the past six years, not only did he clinch an NBA championship in the 2019-20 season, breaking a decade-long drought for the Lakers, but he also led the team to an In-Season Tournament victory in 2023-24. These accomplishments highlight a period of resurgence for the Lakers, firmly re-establishing them as contenders in the league.\n\nThroughout his tenure, LeBron has been the linchpin for the Lakers, melding young talents with experienced players and consistently delivering high-performance play. He adapted to different roles as needed, guiding the team through both regular seasons and playoffs with his strategic play and leadership. Even with challenges like injuries and significant roster changes, his ability to inspire and elevate his teammates has been a constant.\n\nIt's worth noting that LeBron's era with the Lakers isn't over yet. Although he might opt out of his player option and become a free agent, signs point to him likely staying with the team. This ongoing journey means LeBron still has chapters to write in his Lakers story, promising more opportunities to bolster his already impressive legacy.\n\nBy any measure, LeBron's impact on the Lakers deserves an 'A'. His time in LA has not only added another championship banner but has also rejuvenated the franchise, keeping them in the championship conversation and setting high standards for the team's future campaigns.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles Lakers Regular Season Record And Playoff Success In The Last 40 Seasons", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"},

Smith blasts Lakers' Darvin Ham firing -- 'He got screwed'", "body": "Smith absolutely ripped apart the Lakers on Monday morning during First Take, saying Ham essentially didn't deserve to be let go:\n\n\"He got screwed. It was the wrong decision. In two seasons, he went to the Western Conference Finals, he went to the playoffs twice, they were better this year than they were last year, they just ran into the reigning NBA champions and last year they ran into the best team in basketball and ended up being the champions. That's the only team that's knocked off the Lakers, is that the course for being fired? I don't know what to say about that.\n\nListen, no coach is perfect, I'm sure folks can point to things he could've done differently schematically, with rotations, but look at the roster itself, it was problematic, you had shooters who couldn't defend, defenders who couldn't shoot, you're Darvin Ham and you have to throw in certain guys for defensive purposes and then exchange them for guys with offensive prowess because that's what you needed. Very few could do both outside of LeBron James and Anthony Davis, so these are the kind of things he had to deal with.\"\n\nWas Lakers' early exit Darvin Ham's fault?\n\nFirst off, Los Angeles dismissed Ham in the most unprofessional way possible. It was revealed that GM Rob Pelinka called the coach to inform him of his firing instead of meeting face-to-face. Ruthless, to say the least.\n\nAs Stephen A. alluded to though, it's unfair to put the blame on Ham for the Lakers' first-round exit. I mean, he got them to the west finals a year ago and again, the Nuggets were the only team that proved to be their kryptonite. This is a group that struggled immensely to shoot the basketball all season long and wasn't exactly stellar defensively, either. Ham did his best to use the players he had at his disposal.\n\nA 90-74 record across two seasons didn't exactly warrant being fired. There were a ton of roster changes and injuries, yet Ham kept them afloat. It also remains a serious challenge for anyone to stay LeBron James' coach for very long, plus AD kind of threw Ham under the bus with some of his comments during the Nuggets' series. That wasn't a great look.\n\nThe Lakers are eyeing several candidates to replace Ham, including Mike Budenholzer and Ty Lue, but the latter is unlikely to leave his gig with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDespite being canned, there's no question Darvin Ham will be getting an opportunity to coach elsewhere. After all, he truly did a nice job in his first time as an HC. That will not go unnoticed by other organizations with openings across the Association.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where Ham lands next.

No one could live up to the standard he had set in LA (five NBA titles) and Chicago (six titles).\n\nBrown had known that when he took the job in 2011. He had said as much during his introductory news conference.\n\n\"I have great respect for Phil Jackson and all of his accomplishments,\" Brown said. \"I'm not sure what size shoe he wears. But I'm not here to fill his shoes. I'm here to help this team and this organization carve our own path to success.\" But acknowledging how much pressure there is on the head coach of the Lakers and actually living through that pressure are two entirely different things.\n\nSix coaches have tried to fill Jackson's shoes in the past 13 years. None has lasted more than three seasons. Darvin Ham became the latest to take that fall when he was fired Friday after just two seasons, despite a 90-74 record and a Western Conference finals appearance last season.\n\nOf those six, two went on to win NBA Coach of the Year awards in subsequent jobs -- Brown with the Sacramento Kings last season and Mike D'Antoni with the Houston Rockets in 2018 -- suggesting it's not the quality of the coach that determines success or failure on one of the NBA's biggest stages.\n\nIt's how the coach manages everything else that comes along with guiding the NBA's glamour franchise. The star-first culture. The magnified lights. The pressurized history.\n\nHam excelled at that in his first season with the Lakers, deftly navigating the franchise through the awkwardness of the Russell Westbrook era while forging a strong bond with the team's superstars, LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and leading the team to an unexpected run to the West finals.\n\nBut his tenure unraveled quickly in his second season.\n\nJames bristled at the idea of restricting his minutes at the start of the season, sources said -- an idea that was noticeably scrapped after just a few games.\n\nThroughout the season, James, Davis and other key rotation players barely bothered to conceal criticisms of Ham's schemes, rotations and in-game adjustments.\n\nAfter Game 2 of the Lakers' first-round series loss to the Denver Nuggets, Davis said bluntly: \"We have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nHam told ESPN he spoke to Davis privately before defending himself and his staff publicly. But the damage had been done. Five nights later James underscored the lack of faith in Ham by stomping his feet in frustration when Ham refused to use his coach's challenge on a play where James insisted they would win.\n\nThey were just two examples in a season long on barely-beneath-the-surface griping. But they were exceptionally visible displays from the team's most visible stars, and ultimately there was no coming back from it.\n\nAnd so another summer of churn begins. The question the Lakers must ask themselves now is why -- and how to come back from yet another short, failed coaching stint.\n\nYears ago, Lakers governor Jeanie Buss told ESPN that it's important to find a coach and stick with him long enough to grow and develop an identity and style of play.\n\nThat was several coaches and countless roster iterations ago. Each hiring and firing was different, but the pattern has remained the same.\n\nAfter last season's playoff run, general manager Rob Pelinka emphasized re-signing the team's own free agents -- Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves and D'Angelo Russell -- rather than trading for a third star or pursuing more high-profile free agents.\n\nL.A. brought back Ham and his staff and hoped they'd build off of last year's run. Early on, it seemed possible, as the Lakers won the inaugural in-season tournament.\n\nThen, once again, the season unraveled. Injuries mounted. Ham tinkered with his lineups to try to recapture the defensive intensity that had driven last year's success. But instead of sparking a resurgence, Ham sparked resentment. Players started venting their frustrations publicly and privately.\n\nEventually it became obvious Ham would be the one to pay the price if L.A. lost early in the playoffs.\n\nIt was so obvious that Nuggets coach Michael Malone tried to put in a good word for Ham at his news conference after Denver's series-ending win Monday night.\n\n\"I think Darvin Ham is a hell of a coach,\" Malone said after Game 5. \"That's not an easy job. I think Darvin does it with class. He's a good man, good coach, and I wish him all the best. Hopefully, he'll be around there for a long time because he deserves to be.\"\n\nFour days later, Ham was fired.\n\nMalone had faced a similar crossroads back in 2018, when the Nuggets lost Game 83 to the Minnesota Timberwolves and missed the playoffs. The Nuggets came close to firing him after the season, sources said. But ultimately the team decided to run it back and give him another chance. It still took two more seasons for Malone and Denver to make a conference finals and five more for them to win a championship, however.\n\nThe Nuggets are now the class of the NBA with soon-to-be three-time MVP Nikola Jokic, the NBA's fourth-longest-tenured coach and a championship core that's mostly under contract for two more seasons.\n\nContinuity matters. Fourteen of the team's 17 championships were won by three coaches.\n\nThat kind of patience and stability is a luxury in the NBA. Everyone strives for it, but very few franchises achieve it.\n\nThe Lakers have tried and failed to find it six times since Jackson retired in 2011.\n\nEveryone who has taken the job says they know what they're getting into. From Kobe Bryant to LeBron James, and everyone and everything in between, no one the franchise has hired has been able to withstand it.\n\nBefore the Lakers hire their next coach, they need to figure out why.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

"DALLAS - The Dallas Mavericks beat the Los Angeles Clippers 114-101 to advance to the second round of the NBA Playoffs on Friday as Orlando forced a decisive Game 7 against Cleveland despite 50 points from Cavs star Donovan Mitchell.\n\nThe Magic dominated late on their home floor in Orlando to overcome a heroic performance from Mitchell, beating the Cavaliers 103-96 to knot their best-of-seven Eastern Conference first-round series at three games apiece.\n\nIn Dallas, Luka Doncic scored 28 points and Kyrie Irving scored 30 - 28 in the second half - as the Mavericks locked up a 4-2 Western Conference victory over the Clippers, who were again without injured star Kawhi Leonard.\n\nDoncic added seven rebounds and 13 assists to gain a measure of revenge against a Clippers team that ousted his Mavs in the first round in 2020 and 2021.\n\nDallas will next face the Oklahoma City Thunder, the surprise Western top seeds who swept New Orleans 4-0.\n\nThe series will offer a tantalizing matchup between Slovenian star Doncic and Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, both Most Valuable Player award finalists along with Nikola Jokic - whose reigning champion Denver Nuggets face Minnesota in the second round.\n\n\"We stayed together,\" Doncic said.\n\nMeanwhile, Darvin Ham was fired as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers Friday, four days after the team was ousted from the NBA playoffs by Denver, the club announced.\n\nHam went 90-74 in two seasons guiding the Lakers, but the team was swept by eventual NBA champion Denver in last year's Western Conference final and eliminated in five games in round one by the Nuggets this season.\n\n\"We greatly appreciate Darvin's efforts on behalf of the Lakers and recognize the many accomplishments achieved over the past two seasons, including last year's remarkable run to the Western Conference finals,\" Lakers vice president of basketball operations Rob Pelinka said.\n\nIn addition to who will

However, the Lakers only managed to take one game off the Nuggets and exited the postseason after losing in Game 5.\n\nThe Nuggets also seemed to hold the advantage in the series because of their collective size, length and outside shooting while the Lakers were somewhat limited in their ability to adjust. However, what was curious was that former head coach Darvin Ham didn't try to turn to Max Christie to give the perimeter defense a boost.\n\nChristie rode the bench for the entire series and he admitted he felt like he could've helped Los Angeles.\n\n\"Yeah, I really wanted to be out there for sure,\" Christie said. \"Tonight sucks seeing us get eliminated because I really feel like I could've helped this team.\n\n\"But I think that's what everybody feels like when they're not playing, everybody wants to be out there. But we played really hard, Denver gave us a lot of problems and I think we adjusted really well over the course of the series. We got a game last game and were really close this game, so it's just part of the season. Hopefully have a great summer and try to rebuild and come back stronger.\"\n\nChristie fell out of the rotation midway through the 2023-24 season despite having some strong flashes when he did get minutes. He was an excellent point of attack defender who did well chasing over screens, though his lack of consistency from the 3-point line is likely what landed him on planted on the bench.\n\nThe second-year guard will be a restricted free agent this summer and could return to Los Angeles if he doesn't receive a larger offer from another team. Christie still possesses some upside, the Lakers should try to bring him back.\n\nThe Lakers are expected to chase after a star player this summer, though one of the names listed is Kyrie Irving who's currently working on a title run with the Dallas Mavericks. Irving admitted he thought about what it would be like to reunite with James on the Lakers, but said to ask the general managers and team presidents why it didn't happen.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_peralta@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Matt Peralta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Christie_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Christie (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jamal-Murray-Max-Chrsitie.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

While this was a difficult decision to make, it is the best course of action following a full review of the season.\"", "source": {"uri": "modernghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Banchero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Banchero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Wagner_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franz Wagner (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamahl_Mosley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamahl Mosley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/542024105418-g40n1r5edy-89df69b0-09dc-11ef-ae98-f9b7edc72e10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Following Ham's firing, a video has gone viral that shows James demanding that Ham give him the board to draw up a play against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n\"Listen, I got it, I got it,\" James said. \"Hey, give me the board. I got it.\"\n\nI should point out that this game against the Mavericks took place on Feb. 26, 2023, so we were still more than a year away from Ham losing his job. As for the play that was drawn, it was for Anthony Davis to get the ball in the post. Davis got fouled and ended up making one out of two free throws.\n\nThat somewhat left the door open for the Mavericks, but the Lakers eventually won 111-108. LA was down 27 points at one stage in the contest and it was quite an incredible triumph.\n\nGetting back to James, this wasn't a one-time thing either. Less than two months later, LeBron was seen drawing up a play in the Lakers' first-round series against the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nWhen the 20-time All-Star wasn't drawing up plays like this, he was seemingly ignoring the ones that his head coach had drawn up. It was reported that LeBron overrode Ham's plays during timeouts and huddles, and would then call his own ones.\n\nWhile a player with as high a basketball IQ as James calling plays isn't out of the ordinary, it seemed to be happening a lot more often than you would want. LeBron himself also revealed once that he vetoed Ham's game plan to help the Lakers beat the Los Angeles Clippers. All certainly was not well between the two.\n\nLeBron James Was Not Happy About Darvin Ham's Plan To Limit His Minutes\n\nIt would appear that Ham's plays weren't the only thing that James wasn't all that pleased about. In the season opener against the Nuggets, LeBron only played 29 minutes, and afterward, the head coach confirmed that was the plan moving forward. LeBron, though, was not happy with the Lakers' plan to limit his minutes.\n\n\"Ham's tenure unraveled quickly in his second season,\" wrote Shelburne. \"James bristled at the idea of restricting his minutes at the start of the season,\" sources said -- an idea that was noticeably scrapped after just a few games.\"\n\nIt actually wasn't even a few games. James played 35 minutes against the Phoenix Suns in their very next outing and it was clear that the plan had already been thrown out of the window. It was pretty evident then, as to who was calling the shots, not that it was something that surprised anyone.\n\nIt wasn't just LeBron who seemed to have issues with the 50-year-old either. Anthony Davis also took a public shot at Ham by claiming there were stretches during games where they didn't know what they were doing.\n\nWhen you also factor in that Ham had reportedly frustrated Lakers players by benching D'Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves during the season, the writing seemed to be on the wall once the team was eliminated in the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Just days after LA's exit, Ham was fired.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gautam_varier@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Gautam Varier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D'Angelo Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQ1MjI4NTQ0MjcxNzcx/440846149_404136169249964_1414850124101168678_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

However, this year's playoff matchup was even closer despite Los Angeles losing in five games as they were on the wrong end of Jamal Murray's last-second shotmaking. Murray sent the Lakers home himself in Game 5 when he drilled a jumper in the lane that wound up being the game-winner.\n\nIt was a disappointing end for a team that entered the 2023-24 season thinking they had a shot to compete for a title, but instead now face an uncomfortable truth that massive changes may be needed to reach the league's top level.\n\nDespite the loss to Denver, Pau Gasol expressed how proud he was of his former team, via his personal X account:\n\nGasol's optimism and ability to look on the bright side made him a fan favorite in Los Angeles and his words of support should give the organization some validation that they might not be too far away from seriously competing.\n\nLast year, the Lakers were able hang their hat on the fact that they competed every game against the Nuggets despite getting swept. This time around, though, Los Angeles showed they could do more than just hang with arguably the best team in the league.\n\nWhile Gasol remains proud of the team, the front office is looking at another pivotal summer where they'll need to decide the best path toward winning a title. Reports have them eyeing a third star like Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell to pair with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, but it remains to be seen which way they go.\n\nHead coach Darvin Ham didn't do himself any favors this past season as he continually tinkered with his lineups and rotations despite having a proven formula from winning. The constant lineup shifting resulted in some frustrating losses which lead some in the Lakers organizations to believe that the team would've finished higher in the standings had the starting lineup been settled on earlier.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_peralta@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Matt Peralta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau_Gasol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pau Gasol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pau-Gasol.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLos Angeles Lakers executives felt there were significant issues with the team under Darvin Ham this season, which is why the head coach was fired earlier this week. For LeBron James, one of those issues apparently came about very early in the year.\n\nESPN's Ramona Shelburne wrote on Saturday that Ham wanted to restrict LeBron's minutes at the start of the season, which was not that crazy of a plan for a player who was about to turn 39. However, Shelburne reports that James \"bristled at the idea\" and that it was scrapped a few games into the season.\n\nObviously, LeBron's relationship with Ham did not sour because the coach wanted to give his best player more rest. It may not have soured at all, in fact, though Shelburne also noted that James, Anthony Davis and other players \"barely bothered to conceal criticisms\" of Ham's X's and O's strategies both publicly and privately throughout the season.\n\nThe most animated we saw LeBron in venting his frustrations toward Ham was in the fourth quarter of the Lakers' Game 4 loss to the Denver Nuggets last Saturday. James felt Ham should have challenged a call and went ballistic when the coach chose not to (video here).\n\nHam went 90-74 record in two seasons with the Lakers. He led the team to the Western Conference Finals last year, where they lost to the eventual NBA champion Nuggets. They were then swept by Denver in the opening round this year.\n\nConsidering the roster shortcomings in L.A., the results under Ham were not all that bad.

Led by Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, and Wilt Chamberlain, they were as stacked as any team the NBA had ever seen.\n\nDespite an early-season injury to Chamberlain, he would return just before the start of the playoffs and help lead the Lakers to the NBA Finals where they would square off with Willis Reed, Walt Frazier and the New York Knicks.\n\nOn May 6, 1970, the Lakers were facing elimination with Game 6 at home, but they made sure this series would go to a decisive Game 7, and made some history along the way.\n\nThe Lakers dominated the Knicks for a 135-113 win. As a team they shot 60.6 percent from the field, setting an NBA Finals record that would last 15 years. They also totaled 44 assists, setting another Finals record that has only been matched by the 1987 Lakers.\n\nThe field goal percentage record was undoubtedly sparked by Chamberlain, who made a ridiculous 20 of his 27 shots on his way to 45 points and 27 rebounds. Guard Dick Garrett also helped matters by knocking down nine of his 11 shots from the field.\n\nThe assists were, of course, led by West who totaled 13 of them to go along with his 33 points. Four other Lakers would dish out at least five and all but three players who saw the floor had at least one. Everything was a true team effort.\n\nLakers would lose Game 7\n\nUnfortunately for the Lakers they would ultimately come up short in that Game 7. Of course that was the famous 'Willis Reed Game' in which the Knicks center who wasn't expected to play, limped out on the floor and hit the first two shots of the game to spark the Knicks to victory.\n\nEven still, this Lakers squad was a talented group as they showed on this day 48 years ago in setting multiple NBA Finals records.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_hansford@lakersnation.com", "name": "Corey Hansford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elgin_Baylor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elgin Baylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willis Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walt Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wilt-Chamberlain-Jerry-West.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The back-and-forth started on Twitter, formerly X, last year when LeBron James and Co. were swept by the Denver Nuggets in the West Finals. The feud was rekindled in 2024 when Los Angeles was again sent home by the defending champs in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nAfter the Lakers were sunk by Jamal Murray's jumper in Game 5, the Hall of Fame coach promptly commented. He said that LA has been \"unstable\" since the legendary coach Phil Jackson left them. Karl also urged the team to move on from the 2020 championship, which in his book \"doesn't count.\"\n\nLA Nation finally got the opportunity for some payback on Saturday when the Denver Nuggets lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 1 of their semi-final series. Behind Anthony Edwards' playoff career-high 43 points and a sizzling fourth-quarter by Naz Reid, Minnesota stole home-court advantage with a 106-99 victory.\n\nGeorge Karl must have taken some shots that he eventually posted on X:\n\n\"Lotta chatter from Lakers fans this weekend. You guys should sit back and enjoy teams built the right way battle for the next month or so.\n\n\"It's gonna be a long time before you're relevant so lots to study and learn!!\n\nThe Lakers are again facing a summer of uncertainties after getting booted out of the playoffs by the Nuggets. They just fired Darvin Ham after just two seasons at the helm of a team that was expected to always challenge for the championship.\n\nSince Phil Jackson left in 2011, Los Angeles has been a swinging door of six coaches with none surviving more than three seasons. Out of the bunch, only Frank Vogel helped the team to a championship, lifting the Larry O'Brien Trophy in 2020. He was axed two seasons later when he was made the scapegoat of the Russell Westbrook experiment.\n\nGeorge Karl's comments have some truth in them, which is why they have stung Laker Nation.\n\nGeorge Karl might still have the last laugh against fans of the LA Lakers\n\nThe Denver Nuggets series against the Minnesota Timberwolves is far from over. Anthony Edwards and Co. stole home-court advantage but the defending champs, with Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray leading the way, are far from finished. Denver might end up still winning the series, giving George Karl more ammunition to fire at LA Lakers fans.\n\nAdditionally, the Nuggets are set up for sustained success much better than the team from Southern California. \"The Joker,\" \"Glitch\" and Michael Porter Jr. aren't going anywhere. None of Denver's core superstars have reached 30 years old, which will make their success flow for at least a few more years.\n\nThe same can't be said of the LA Lakers who could lose LeBron James next year or in the next 2-3 years. If they want to be relevant, they will have to buy the stars which is the opposite of what the Nuggets have done. George Karl may just have the last laugh this year and for years to come.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_macasero@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Michael Macasero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_O'Brien_Championship_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/665fc-17149014273646-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Playing against Nikola Jokic isn't the easiest thing to do in the world. It didn't end with him as Jamal Murray was a key reason to victory as well as he had two game-winning shots in the series.\n\nDarvin Ham may have been the first NBA Coach fired after the season ended, however, he won't be the last. Doc Rivers of the Milwaukee Bucks had a disappointing end to the season and so did Frank Vogel of the Phoenix Suns too. Truth be told, none of these Head Coaches should be to blame for their early playoff exits. With that being said, the one coach out of the three possible candidates the Wizards should consider hiring to be their Head Coach is Darvin Ham.\n\nThroughout his tenure as the Head Coach of the LA Lakers, you have to tip your hat off and respect the work he has done. The Lakers were close to making the NBA Finals last season. The Denver Nuggets were the only road block to them. This season, the Nuggets were road blocks again. Jamal Murray in particular as the games were close as he had to hit two game-winning shots to secure victories within the series.\n\nBattling injuries by often injured Anthony Davis and an older LeBron James didn't help. The team as a whole battled multiple injuries and inconsistencies between DeAngelo Russell and Austin Reaves who were supposed to be co-stars there too. Playing and coaching in LA brings a lot of pressure to everyone. Despite it all, Ham was still competitive and managed to make the playoffs as well as win the first-ever In-Season NBA Tournament this season.\n\nHam is a good Head Coach in the league despite getting fired. Playing in the West isn't easy either. If he were to come to the East, that could make his job and life easier with the Wizards. He also has ties with them too as he played one season there in 1997.

The fact that LeBron continues to be one of the NBA's top players and provide outstanding highlights at 39 years old also helps his cause.\n\nJames averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists this year while suiting up for 71 games, his most since his final season with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2018. Along the way he was provided some truly unreal highlights and moments.\n\nHis 36-point, 20-rebound, 12-assist triple-double in the Lakers' double-overtime win over the Golden State Warriors in one of the best games of the year is chief among those. The same can be said of his comeback-leading 19-point fourth quarter in the Lakers' win over the Los Angeles Clippers. LeBron simply makes fans in awe with what he is capable of at this stage of his career.\n\nAdditionally, James also became the first player in NBA history to reach 40,000 points in his career earlier this season.\n\nThe Lakers star was one of four players to top one billion views on NBA social this year.

PHOTOS COURTESY OF ALLUCANHEAT.COM\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Bam Adebayo took charge. Kyle Lowry took a charge.\n\nBoth were absolutely required for the Miami Heat to hold off LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday night.\n\nAdebayo had the first 20-rebound triple-double in Miami history, Jimmy Butler scored 28 points and the Heat survived a big offensive drought at the end to beat the Lakers 108-107 - a game in which no points were scored in the final 2: 38.\n\nAdebayo had 22 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists for Miami in his sixth regular-season triple-double. Tyler Herro also scored 22 for the Heat and Duncan Robinson added 12 for Miami - won despite having no field goals in the final 4:14.\n\n\"Kudos to Miami,\" James said. \"They played some really good ball tonight. We were able to match their intensity. We played some really good ball as well.\" James led all scorers with 30 points for the Lakers, who fell to 0-4 on the road. Austin Reaves was an assist shy of a triple-double, finishing with 23 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists.\n\n\"Bron was phenomenal. ... That's a tough team to go against,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said.\n\nThe Lakers didn't have Anthony Davis for the final 14 minutes; he left the game twice with a left hip spasm and finished with nine points and six rebounds.\n\n\"Let it calm down, get treatment, get ready to suit up on Wednesday,\" Davis said.\n\nAdebayo was called for traveling with 8.9 seconds remaining, giving the Lakers a final chance. The inbounds pass went to James, who drove right and found a wide- open Cam Reddish for what would have been a game-winning corner jumper.\n\nIt bounced off the rim, Butler secured the rebound and time expired.\n\n\"LeBron's going to be LeBron and pass the ball to the open man,\" Butler said. \"He did that. He literally whipped it to the corner ... Cam shot it and missed it. Good for us.\"\n\nAnother huge play late: Lowry taking a charge against James with 1:57 left, with the listed difference in height and weight among those players being nine inches and 55 pounds.\n\n\"In those kind of moments, he'll figure out how to make a winning play,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Lowry.\n\nLakers guard D'Angelo Russell got ejected with 7:52 left for picking up a pair of technical fouls for arguing, and the free throws by Herro put the Heat up 100- 88 - just 32 seconds after the Lakers had a chance to get within three points.\n\nTaurean Prince missed a 3-pointer that would have cut Miami's six-point lead in half, and the game quickly changed. Jaime Jaquez Jr. had a layup, then Russell had a turnover, and Jaquez Jr. had another layup. Adebayo had assists on both of those scores by Jaquez, giving him the triple-double, and Russell was ejected for arguing after the second basket.\n\nHam also got a technical late in the third, and the Lakers had a delay-ofgame technical - those free throws all proving costly in a one-point loss.\n\n\"All I want is an explanation sometimes,\" Ham said. \"To not get that for the rest of the game once I got my technical ... Miami plays a physical brand of basketball. We're not complaining about how physical they are. We just want balance and consistency.

What will the Suns, Lakers and every other first-round loser do now?", "body": "LeBron James and Anthony Davis.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo, Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton.\n\nKevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal.\n\nKawhi Leonard, James Harden, Paul George and Russell Westbrook.\n\nJoel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\nJimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.\n\nIt seems weird to think that not a single one of those All-Stars made it past the first round, but that's exactly what just happened in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. A lot of these teams had championship aspirations -- and equally high payrolls to boot -- so after being forced home early, where do they go from here?\n\nDo they start a complete rebuild? Reload and try again? Somewhere in the middle? That's what we'll try to figure out here, as we run down the next steps for every NBA team that faced a disappointing early exit.\n\n49-33 season, Lost 4-0 to Timberwolves\n\nUnder contract: Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Jusuf Nurkic, Grayson Allen, Nassir Little, David Roddy\n\nThe Suns' roster around their very expensive \"big three\" of Durant, Booker and Beal showed shaky chemistry and fit throughout the year, then got swept in the first round.\n\n\"The house is not on fire. We're in a great position!\" Suns owner Mat Ishbia claimed recently, sounding almost like a real-life version of the This is Fine meme. And despite failing to win a single playoff game, he's doubling down, paying massive luxury tax bills, and sticking with his core.\n\nThat's partly because they don't really have much of a choice, having already traded away almost their entire future for these long, expensive contracts. Beal, the weakest member of the big three, also has a no-trade clause and $161 million remaining on his contract through 2027.\n\nThey're now reportedly considering firing Frank Vogel, so part of this offseason could be spent looking for a new coach. They also have a real need for defense, depth, and possibly a point guard -- even if they disagree -- so how can they improve?\n\nThat expensive starting five means they're once again going to be in the dreaded second tax apron. This limits the moves they can make, and they will again rely on veteran's minimum players to fill out a roster that was already the second oldest in the league.\n\nThe biggest change can only be done via trade, and contrary to popular belief, they will actually have two first round picks they can move on draft night. The Suns can trade the No. 22 pick and another first-rounder all the way in 2031, and they also have a 2028 second round pick available.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if they make another big swing, and if they send out even more picks with either Nurkic ($18 million) or Little ($6.7 million). Allen ($15 million) can't be traded until October by virtue of his recent extension, and they might want to hold on to the 46% 3-point shooter.\n\nI'm not sure if just mortgaging an entire decade of picks for this big three will pay off, or if a new coach can magically fix their issues. But they're going all in again, and it'll at least be fun to watch unfold.\n\nThey don't really have much of a choice or much to work with, so this will probably be close to a full reload apart from a new coach and minor changes.\n\n47-35 season, IST champion, Lost 4-1 to Nuggets\n\nUnder contract: Anthony Davis, Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt, Jalen Hood-Schifino, Maxwell Lewis\n\nPlayer option: LeBron James, D'Angelo Russell, Christian Wood, Jaxson Hayes, Cam Reddish\n\nLeBron James impressively keeps fending off Father Time, but this first round exit seems like a waste of great (and healthy!) seasons from both him and Anthony Davis. They went above and beyond what was expected, but basically everyone else failed them.\n\nThe inconsistent Lakers dropped so many winnable games, which led to the worst possible first-round match-up and an early exit. Darvin Ham and his staff have been fired, and a lot of blame got (fairly) put on his questionable coaching, but it should also go to the Lakers management. Jeanie Buss and Rob Pelinka were the ones who hired Ham, constructed the flawed roster, and made moves designed less for basketball and more for cost-cutting. From lowballing coaches, to letting Caruso walk, to not giving Reaves, Christie and Horton-Tucker longer rookie deals, or always leaving an empty roster slot despite being ravaged with injuries, the Lakers kept making short-sighted decisions for small \"savings\" that only ended up costing them more in the long run.\n\nAt their best, this current Lakers core has still been pretty good, winning the inaugural In-Season Tournament, and looking like a contender in flashes. \"Pretty good\" isn't going to cut it though, and the Lakers are reportedly going big game hunting yet again, for better or worse.\n\nA (somewhat weird) coaching search is already underway, and with LeBron said to be opting out of his deal, he will likely use his free agency as leverage to force roster improvements as well.\n\nD'Lo is perpetually in trade rumors, but he could also just opt out and control his destiny this offseason. That still leaves a lot of tradable contracts and three first round picks, and the Lakers are reportedly looking to get a third star like Trae Young or Donovan Mitchell.\n\nI'd argue it's better to package those picks for cheaper starters so they can upgrade and not trade away all their young players, but that's not the Lakers' style and they want the biggest name to lead the post-LeBron era (Technically, the Lauri Markkanen pipe dream ticks both boxes, but many teams can outbid them there).\n\nWe don't know if the Lakers can get a blockbuster deal done, or if any of those stars are even really available, but expect them to be involved in just about every NBA rumor in the next several weeks.\n\nThe Lakers will fall somewhere in the middle. They're most likely going to reload with their two stars, but we can expect a new coach and a rebuilt supporting cast.\n\n49-33 season, Lost 4-0 to Thunder\n\nUnder contract: Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram, CJ McCollum, Herb Jones, Larry Nance Jr., Dyson Daniels, Trey Murphy III, Jordan Hawkins, EJ Liddell, Malcolm Hill\n\nEven ignoring the disappointing sweep and the lacking supporting cast, there are also many concerns with the Pelicans' core players.\n\nZion played 70 games this season, but got injured yet again late, leaving the same questions about health and conditioning. Ingram is currently due for a contract extension, but he was also flat-out bad in the playoffs, and has an offensive game based on taking shots that opposing teams want him to take.\n\nBoth are still young, but it's hard to be optimistic about where this current group can go, and perhaps it's time to make major changes.\n\nThe Pelicans should hope Zion's conditioning and work ethic continues to improve this offseason, but they do have a lot of draft capital they can package with Ingram to get major upgrades.\n\nThey could also choose to package McCollum instead, but he seems to be a better complementary piece right now. Either way, the Pelicans have options and a LOT of tradable assets, with two first round picks this year, and several more until 2030.\n\nThe media cycle will be about big market teams going big game hunting, but the Pelicans can be the dark horse that outbids everyone. New Orleans has never paid the luxury tax though, so it'll be curious if this will be the year they decide to add more salary.\n\nI'd say they should rebuild around Zion, but does their management pull the trigger? And what can they get with Ingram's stock possibly taking a hit in the postseason?\n\n51-31 season, Lost 4-2 to Mavericks\n\nUnder contract: Kawhi Leonard, Norman Powell, Ivica Zubac, Terance Mann, Bones Hyland, Amir Coffey, Kobe Brown, Jordan Miller\n\nStop me if you've heard this one before: They had a great season! Harden just had a bad game! Things would've been different if Kawhi wasn't injured!\n\nIt's easy to throw out tired and oversimplified narratives about the Clippers, but there are very real issues surrounding the league's oldest -- and second most expensive -- \"super team.\"\n\nClippers had first round exits in the last two postseasons, and did not qualify in the year prior. Next season, Leonard will be 33, George 34, Harden 35, and Westbrook 36.\n\nRepeatedly hoping recurring issues will somehow disappear as they further move away from their primes doesn't make much sense. But fortunately, this offseason could be the best time to actually try something else.\n\nHarden is a free agent, while George, Tucker and Westbrook have player options that can either be cleared from the books or used in trades.\n\nThe Clippers can recoup some assets, have cap flexibility and restart anew. They can try getting younger and change the main pieces surrounding Leonard, but early reports seem to indicate that they're just going to try and run it back yet again.\n\nTo do that, they'll have to max out Paul George, who will be in really high demand this offseason. Then they'll have to re-sign Harden to a pretty expensive new deal as well.\n\nThe Clippers are moving to a new arena and owner Steve Ballmer doesn't seem to want a rebuild. He kept doubling down in recent years, and doing so again probably puts them back over the second apron as a repeat offender, which means they'll have even fewer avenues to improve.\n\nI'm sure this time it will work though. After all, it's just a few bad games from Harden, and it would've been different if Kawhi wasn't injured... right?\n\nUnder contract: Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, Terry Rozier, Duncan Robinson, Jaime Jaquez Jr., Nikola Jovic\n\nNext moves: Extend Adebayo, then have serious conversations about the rest of the team.\n\nThe Miami Heat were the fifth oldest NBA team (27.3 average age), but perhaps more importantly, they looked rundown when they unsurprisingly lost to the top-seeded Celtics.\n\nThe biggest concerns for the Heat now involve the four players who are extension-eligible: Butler, Adebayo, Rozier, and Robinson.\n\nAdebayo will be eligible for a max extension, which the young DPOY finalist clearly deserves. The decisions on the three others won't be as simple.\n\nButler will be 35 next season, and while he's still under contract, he reportedly wants a two-year max extension worth $113 million. Rozier is also extension-eligible, but he and Butler didn't play in the playoffs after dealing with neck and knee injuries, respectively. Robinson did come back from back issues, but he didn't look the same at all.\n\nDoes Riley think Butler would still be worth that hefty price tag, with his mileage and injuries? What will they do with Robinson and Rozier? The Heat can also end up in the second apron, which will likely factor into all of their next moves.\n\nEven with \"culture\" and great coaching, they're definitely not going to be a contender with this current roster. And at that price, they will need to take a serious look at what to do next.\n\nThe Heat have their 15th pick in the draft this year, plus future first round picks in 2030 and 2031 available for a trade.\n\nIf he really doesn't get that max extension, Butler could be on his way out. Expect the Heat to also shop Herro, Rozier, Robinson, plus a pick and at least one of their two promising prospects in Jovic or Jaquez. We'll see if they get any takers though.\n\nI think they should completely rebuild around Adebayo, but that'll really depend if other teams are even interested in what they can offer.\n\n49-33 season, Lost 4-2 to Pacers\n\nUnder contract: Damian Lillard, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez, Bobby Portis, Pat Connaughton, MarJon Beauchamp, Chris Livingston, Ryan Rollins, Jaylin Galloway\n\nIt's fair to blame injuries for this series, but the Bucks also have more issues than that after now exiting in the first round for two consecutive years. This season they were the third oldest team in the NBA, with a flawed roster that lost their trademark guard/wing defense. They also had a mid-season coaching change.\n\nI still don't think hiring Doc Rivers was the best move for the Bucks, who went just 17-19 with him. But he's their coach now and they won't just change that after getting him a fresh $40 million contract. There are also rumors of a GM change, so it'll be interesting to see if that moves forward.\n\nMilwaukee was over the second apron this season, and will likely stay there for the next one. They'll need youth and defense, but it'll be hard to do as they likely won't have much flexibility or assets available.\n\nThe Bucks won a title in 2021, but next season, their core will see Giannis turning 30, Middleton at 32, and Lillard at 33. If he remains with the team, Lopez will also be 36.\n\nWithout much flexibility, the best they can hope is that minor tweaks can plug some holes, and that more reps and better health from both Giannis and Dame can get them back to title contention.\n\nNext moves: Get a star with all that cap space, then take care of Tyrese Maxey.\n\nThe 76ers had a disappointing series against the Knicks, but will have the most flexibility among all these playoff teams this offseason. Harris and Hield had bloated deals, but Philly pretty much only has Embiid under contract now. They have a lot of cap space to build a contender around him and restricted free agent Maxey, who looks like a bonafide star.\n\nThe Sixers will probably target a wing player, and the biggest names available will likely be Paul George, James Harden, DeMar Derozan, Pascal Siakam, Klay Thompson, OG Anunoby, and, although unlikely, LeBron James.\n\nThey're already being linked to George, but that cap space also means being able to absorb entire contracts from a trade. According to ESPN, they'll also be monitoring some of the possible targets we mentioned above, in Jimmy Butler and Brandon Ingram.\n\nThe team will definitely have options, even if it just means bringing in one key star/starter and then re-signing most of their current core. Either way, Sixers are likely to fill up their roster first to maximize that space, before finally taking care of Maxey and signing him over the cap.\n\nEmbiid and Maxey will stay, but the Sixers have a lot of flexibility, so this could go anywhere from adding one or two key players, to a completely rebuilt roster.\n\n47-35 season, Lost 4-3 to Cavs\n\nUnder contract: Cole Anthony, Paolo Banchero, Wendell Carter Jr., Jalen Suggs, Anthony Black, Franz Wagner, Jett Howard\n\nThe Magic have a promising young core around Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs that impressed this season, and they just got invaluable experience during their seven-game playoff series with the Cavs.\n\nThe future seems bright, but what's better for them is that they have so much cap space and a large stash of draft picks to outbid teams and make even bigger improvements. Banchero, Suggs and Wagner are still on rookie-scale contracts, and the Magic will have a lot of flexibility to add to an already promising team.\n\nThey can use some veteran leadership and another guard, which makes it no surprise that they're already being tied to Paul George as well.\n\nThe Magic could also opt for someone a bit closer to their young core's timelines, like OG Anunoby or Malik Monk, before picking up veterans on any of their exemptions. They could also absorb big contracts through trades with that space, like say Dejounte Murray or maybe Anfernee Simons.\n\nAfter filling up the team, they can re-sign some of their own free agents like Gary Harris or Markelle Fultz (should they choose to bring him back), before eventually handling the rookie extensions of Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs.\n\nThis offseason can go a lot of different ways depending on who is truly gettable in free agency and what Orlando is actually willing to spend, but the Magic are in a great position to just add key pieces to a young playoff team that has already overachieved.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki",

He was regarded as a 3-and-D player, which was something the Lakers had lacked over the previous couple of seasons.\n\nPrince began the regular season in then-head coach Darvin Ham's starting lineup, which led some to criticize Ham, especially when he later settled on Rui Hachimura for that same starting small forward spot. Prince was lackluster defensively and didn't help much on the boards, but he did contribute in an important area -- 3-point shooting.\n\nBefore the season started, he said he wanted to shoot 40% from 3-point range for the season. He struggled in November, but Ham stuck with him and played him major minutes during the first few months of the season, which led to more criticism.\n\nHowever, Prince came on strong starting in December, and he ended the regular season at 39.6% from downtown.\n\nHe was moved to the bench in February in favor of Hachimura, and it seems as if that was the move that got the Lakers going. It also may have helped Prince improve his shooting efficiency.\n\nAs a starter this season, he made 43.1% of his field-goal attempts and 38.4% of his 3-point attempts. But as a reserve, he ended up at 46.9% overall and 42.9% from downtown.\n\nPrince will be a free agent this summer, and while many Lakers fans may not want him back, he can continue to help a Lakers team that struggled mightily from 3-point land early in the season, only to get hot afterward.", "source": {"uri": "lebronwire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LeBron Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_marvi@lebronwire.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Marvi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurean_Prince", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taurean Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2024/05/USATSI_22956991-e1714962042928.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

And we are all witnesses.\n\nAfter the news dropped that, as expected, head coach Darvin Ham was being let go following a five-game first round defeat at the hands of the Denver Nuggets, L.A. has apparently wasted no time in cleaning house elsewhere.\n\nAccording to Dave McMenamin of ESPN, the Lakers have now fired all of Ham's bench, including longtime assistant coach and player development trainer Phil Handy, who has worked under four different, nonconsecutive Los Angeles head coaching regimes.\n\nThe departures of the other assistants doesn't come as much of a surprise, but team president Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss' decision to ditch Handy, too, is a bit stunning.\n\nHandy first served under Mike Brown from 2011-12 and his replacement, Mike D'Antoni, from 2012-13, during the end of the Kobe Bryant-Pau Gasol era. After winning championships with the LeBron James-era Cleveland Cavaliers and the Nick Nurse-era Toronto Raptors, Handy returned to L.A. under head coach Frank Vogel, winning his third title immediately in 2019-20. Even after Vogel was let go in 2022, Handy stuck around. He had been considered a potential fit as a Darvin Ham replacement ever since Darvin Ham was hired, frankly (he had a bumpy start with Russell Westbrook in 2022), so it's surprising to see that he, too, is out.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kirschenbaum@si.com", "name": "Alex Kirschenbaum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Handy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Handy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Brown_(basketball,_born_1970)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_D'Antoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike D'Antoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau_Gasol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pau Gasol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5790,h_3256,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx07y2kj6rpc5fcpar", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539541", "eventUri": "eng-9539541", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

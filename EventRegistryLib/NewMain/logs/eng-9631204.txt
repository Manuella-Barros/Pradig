It culminated in a treble that included La Liga, the Champions League, and the Spanish Super Cup. However, the 20-year-old midfielder's journey was far from easy; Bellingham played through a persistent shoulder injury for much of the campaign.\n\nBellingham dislocated his shoulder during a 0-0 draw with Rayo Vallecano in November. The initial recovery period saw him miss only two to three weeks. However, the injury lingered, requiring him to wear a heavy brace and play through significant discomfort. According to Cadena SER, surgery is a possibility to address the ongoing issue, although it is an option that all parties are keen to avoid.\n\nDespite the injury, the Englishman made 47 appearances in all competitions, scoring 23 goals and playing a pivotal role in Real Madrid's treble-winning season. His ability to perform at such a high level while managing pain is a testament to his resilience and determination.\n\nBellingham's shoulder injury has not fully healed, and his participation in Euro 2024 could exacerbate the problem. If the injury persists, surgery may become unavoidable, potentially sidelining him for up to three months. This would mean missing the entire pre-season and the start of the 2024-25 campaign. It would be a significant setback for both the player and Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nMedical experts have indicated that, while \"conservative treatment\" is the first course of action, a dislocated shoulder often requires surgical intervention if pain and instability continue. Bellingham's condition has been monitored closely, with Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti acknowledging the possibility of surgery if the shoulder does not improve.\n\nThroughout the season, Bellingham has struggled with his shoulder injury, especially noticeable before the Champions League final. Despite the pain, he continued to deliver outstanding performances, helping Los Blancos secure major trophies. His situation highlights the challenges athletes face when balancing the desire to compete with the need to manage serious injuries.\n\nThe midfielder's commitment to his team and his ability to perform under such circumstances have not gone unnoticed. He acknowledged the difficulties he faced during the season but also expressed that the success made all the hardships worthwhile. \"I've always dreamed of playing in these games,\" he told TNT Sports. \"When it gets hard at times you start to wonder if it's all worth it - but nights like tonight make it all worth it.\"\n\nAs Bellingham prepares to join the England squad for Euro 2024, his fitness remains a concern. He missed a friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina following Real Madrid's Champions League triumph. Nonetheless, he is expected to be a key player for England in the tournament. The hope is that he can manage his condition throughout the competition without the need for immediate surgery.\n\nLooking ahead, Real Madrid and Bellingham will need to weigh the long-term benefits of surgical intervention against the short-term impact on his availability.

The ex-Dortmund sensation enjoyed a remarkable debut season with Los Blancos, helping them win the La Liga title and a memorable 15th Champions League.\n\nBellingham scored 23 goals in all competitions from 42 games, with 19 in the league.\n\nThe Englishman scored 14 of the 19 goals in the first 15 games, beating Cristiano Ronaldo's previous first-season record of 13.\n\nBellingham also registered 13 assists, demonstrating his all-round match-winning capacities.\n\nFrom 90-minute winners to an El-Classico hat trick and Champions League-winning assist, there was little to deny the inevitable hype Bellingham was getting.\n\nNot to mention that the 20-year-old's media image is remarkably flawless.\n\nHe is well-spoken and mature for his age, and he never puts a foot wrong. Jude Bellingham is the perfect poster boy for Real Madrid to take them into the new generation following departures from crucial figures over the years.\n\nIn stark contrast to Bellingham, Vinicius Jr. is a player who does not get the same hype and recognition as Bellingham due to his perception by the vast public despite being Madrid's top performer for the last few seasons.\n\nAfter winning his second Champions League with Real Madrid, Vinicius became only the second player to score in multiple UEFA Champions League finals before turning 24, the other being Lionel Messi.\n\nIn a game where Bellingham had a quiet game by his standards, Vinicius stood up, showing energy on the wing and urging the crowd when the game was slipping from Madrid.\n\nThe sealing goal was just the cherry on top for a player who has been 'amongst the elites' for a while now.\n\nVinicius properly arrived on the scene in the 21/22 season and has not looked back ever since.\n\nThe electrifying winger, who previously had been criticized for his end product in the final third, refined his craft to an elite level, scoring a breakout 17 goals in La Liga.\n\nVini also netted four goals in the Champions League that season, including the winning goal against Liverpool in the final.\n\nThe Brazillian's output continued to skyrocket, with 23 Champions League goal contributions in his last 22 games.\n\nHe always showed up in the biggest of games. His elite form saw him beat Messi's knockout stage assists record of 12 in 55 fewer games.\n\nA stat said Vinicius had scored or assisted in 92% of the knockout stages he has played in the Champions League. The only time he failed was against Chelsea in the 2021 semi-finals.\n\nThis was no longer the same talented but wasteful teenager from Flamengo who Madrid legend Karim Benzema said was \"playing against us\" to Benjamin Mendy.\n\nSo why does Vinicius not get the media hype and recognition of other top players, such as Earling Haaland, Kylian Mbappe - and even Bellingham?\n\nThis is because people still perceive Vini as this wonder kid who arrived from Campeonato Brasileiro and could not score a goal to save his life despite the statistical output that has been evident for the last three years.\n\nVinicius doesn't do his image any favours with his antics on and off the pitch, but with a maturity that will disappear from his game.\n\nBut we do have to keep in mind the constant racial abuse the Madrid star has to go through, so some of his actions are justified.\n\nIt's time for the public to accept that Vinicius Jr. is undoubtedly one of the best footballers in the world. Despite the headlines, he is the face of Real Madrid and will be for the next decade.\n\nIt may not take long for Vini to earn his due respect with the Balon D'or ceremony on the horizon, with the 'Prince of Madrid' going in as one of the major favorites.\n\nThe football world will eagerly tune in to what would be an exciting vote count to which the name Vinicius Jnr is bound to have been ever-present.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_Flamengo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CR Flamengo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Brasileiro_S\u00e9rie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn4.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Real-Madrid-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9631204", "eventUri": "eng-9631204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

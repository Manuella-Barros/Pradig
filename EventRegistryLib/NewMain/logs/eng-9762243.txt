Together with OP Corporate Bank plc, its role is to raise funding for OP Financial Group from money and capital markets.\n\nFinancial standing\n\nThe intermediary loans and loan portfolio of OP MB totalled EUR 16,758 million (16,988)* on 30 June 2024. Bonds issued by OP MB totalled EUR 14,915 million (14,915) at the end of June.\n\nOP MB's covered bonds after 8 July 2022 are issued under the Euro Medium Term Covered Bond (Premium) programme (EMTCB), pursuant to the Finnish Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds (151/2022). The collateral is added to the EMTCB cover pool from the member cooperative banks' balance sheets via the intermediary loan process on the issue date of a new covered bond.\n\nIn January, OP MB issued a covered bond in the international capital market. The fixed-rate covered bond worth EUR 1 billion has a maturity of seven years and six months. All proceeds of the bond were intermediated to 63 OP cooperative banks in the form of intermediary loans.\n\nThe terms of issue are available on the op.fi website, under Debt investors: www.op.fi/op-ryhma/velkasijoittajat/issuers/op-mortgage-bank/emtcb-debt-programme-documentation.\n\nOn 30 June 2024, 100 OP cooperative banks had a total of EUR 14,800 million (14,800) in intermediary loans from OP MB.\n\nImpairment loss on receivables related to loans in OP MB's balance sheet totalled EUR 0.1 million (0.0). Loss allowance was EUR 2.5 million (2.6).\n\nOperating profit was EUR 4.4 million (6.1). The company's financial standing remained stable throughout the reporting period.\n\n* The comparatives for 2023 are given in brackets. For income statement and other aggregated figures, January-June 2023 figures serve as comparatives. For balance-sheet and other cross-sectional figures, figures at the end of the previous financial year (31 December 2023) serve as comparatives.\n\nCollateralisation of bonds issued to the public\n\nOn 30 June 2024, loans as collateral in security of the covered bonds of EUR 5,250 million issued under the EMTCB programme worth EUR 25 billion established on 11 October 2022, in accordance with the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds (151/2022), totalled EUR 5,782 million. Loans as collateral in security of the covered bonds, totalling EUR 9,665 million, issued under the Euro Medium Term Covered Note programme worth EUR 20 billion established on 12 November 2010, in accordance with the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks (Laki kiinnitysluottopankkitoiminnasta, 688/2010), totalled EUR 12,013 million on 30 June 2024.\n\nCapital adequacy\n\nOP MB's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio stood at 46.0% (41.8) on 30 June 2024. The ratio was improved by the decrease in mortgages on OP MB's balance sheet and the resulting reduction in capital requirement for credit risk. The minimum CET1 capital requirement is 4.5% and the requirement for the capital conservation buffer is 2.5%. The minimum total capital requirement is 8% (or 10.5% with the increased capital conservation buffer). Because OP MB covers capital requirements in their entirety with CET1 capital, the CET1 capital requirement is 10.5%. Estimated profit distribution has been subtracted from earnings for the reporting period.\n\nOP MB uses the Standardised Approach (SA) to measure its capital adequacy requirement for credit risk. The Standardised Approach is also used to measure the capital requirement for operational risks.\n\nOP MB belongs to OP Financial Group. As part of the Group, OP MB is supervised by the ECB. OP Financial Group presents capital adequacy information in its financial statements bulletins and interim and half-year financial reports in accordance with the Act on the Amalgamation of Deposit Banks. OP Financial Group also publishes Pillar III disclosures.\n\nUnder regulation applied to crisis resolution of credit institutions and investment firms, the resolution authority is authorised to intervene in the terms and conditions of investment products issued by a bank in a way that affects an investor's position. The EU's Single Resolution Board (SRB) based in Brussels is OP Financial Group's resolution authority. The SRB has confirmed a resolution strategy for OP Financial Group whereby the resolution measures would focus on the OP amalgamation and on the new OP Corporate Bank that would be formed in case of resolution. According to the resolution strategy, OP MB will continue its operations as the new OP Corporate Bank's subsidiary.\n\nThe SRB has set a Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) for OP MB. From May 2024, the MREL is 16% of the total risk exposure amount and 18.5% of the total risk exposure amount including a combined buffer requirement, and 6% of leverage ratio exposures. The requirement entered into force on 15 May 2024. The requirement includes a Combined Buffer Requirement (CBR) of 2.5%.\n\nOP MB's buffer for the MREL requirement was EUR 215 million. The buffer consists of own funds only. OP MB clearly exceeds the MREL requirement. OP MB's MREL ratio was 46% of the total risk exposure amount.\n\nJoint and several liability of amalgamation\n\nUnder the Act on the Amalgamation of Deposit Banks, the amalgamation of cooperative banks comprises the organisation's central cooperative (OP Cooperative), the central cooperative's member credit institutions and the companies belonging to their consolidation groups, as well as credit and financial institutions and service companies in which the above together hold more than half of the total votes. This amalgamation is supervised on a consolidated basis. On 30 June 2024, OP Cooperative's member credit institutions comprised 101 OP cooperative banks, OP Corporate Bank plc, OP Mortgage Bank and OP Retail Customers plc.\n\nThe central cooperative is responsible for issuing instructions to its member credit institutions concerning their internal control and risk management, their procedures for securing liquidity and capital adequacy, and for compliance with harmonised accounting policies in the preparation of the amalgamation's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs a support measure referred to in the Act on the Amalgamation of Deposit Banks, the central cooperative is liable to pay any of its member credit institutions the amount necessary to preventing the credit institution from being placed in liquidation. The central cooperative is also liable for the debts of a member credit institution which cannot be paid using the member credit institution's assets.\n\nEach member bank is liable to pay a proportion of the amount which the central cooperative has paid to either another member bank as a support measure or to a creditor of such a member bank in payment of an overdue amount which the creditor has not received from the member bank. Furthermore, if the central cooperative defaults, a member bank has unlimited refinancing liability for the central cooperative's debts as referred to in the Co-operatives Act.\n\nEach member bank's liability for the amount the central cooperative has paid to the creditor on behalf of a member bank is divided between the member banks in proportion to their last adopted balance sheets. OP Financial Group's insurance companies do not fall within the scope of joint and several liability.\n\nAccording to section 25 of the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks (688/2010), which was valid at that time, the creditors of covered bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022 have the right to receive payment, before other claims, for the entire term of the bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the bond, out of the funds entered as collateral for the bond, without this being prevented by OP MB's liquidation or bankruptcy. A similar and equal priority also applies to derivative contracts entered in the register of bonds, and to marginal lending facilities referred to in section 26, subsection 4 of said Act. For mortgage-backed loans issued prior to 8 July 2022 and included in the total amount of collateral of covered bonds, the priority of the covered bond holders' payment right is limited to the amount of loan that, with respect to home loans, corresponds to 70% of the value of shares or property serving as security for the loan and entered in the bond register at the time of the issuer's liquidation or bankruptcy declaration.\n\nUnder section 20 of the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds (151/2022), which entered into force on 8 July 2022, the creditors of bonds issued after 8 July 2022, including the related management and clearing costs, have the right to receive payment from the collateral included in the cover pool, before other creditors of OP MB or the OP cooperative bank which is the debtor of an intermediary loan. A similar priority also applies to creditors of derivative contracts related to covered bonds, including the related management and clearing costs. Interest and yield accruing on the collateral, and any substitute assets, fall within the scope of said priority. Section 44, subsection 3 of the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds includes provisions on the creditor's priority claim regarding cover pool liquidity support. According to said subsection, the creditor has the right to receive payment against the funds contained in the cover pool after claims based on the principal and interest of covered bonds secured by the cover assets included in the cover pool, obligations based on derivatives contracts associated with covered bonds, as well as administration and liquidation costs.\n\nSustainability and corporate responsibility\n\nSustainability and corporate responsibility form an integral part of OP Financial Group's business and strategy, and responsible business is one of OP Financial Group's strategic priorities. The sustainability programme and its policy priorities implement OP Financial Group's strategy, and guide its sustainability and corporate responsibility actions. OP Financial Group's sustainability programme is built around three themes: Climate and the environment, People and communities and Corporate governance.\n\nAt OP Financial Group, sustainability and corporate responsibility are guided by a number of principles and policies. OP Financial Group is committed to complying not only with all applicable laws and regulations, but also with a number of international initiatives and standards guiding our operations. It is also committed to complying with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact initiative in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. Furthermore, OP Financial Group is committed to complying with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment and is a Founding Signatory of the Principles for Responsible Banking under the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).\n\nAs of the reporting year 2024, OP Financial Group reports on its sustainability and corporate responsibility in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) under the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\nOP Financial Group has drawn up a biodiversity road map that includes measures to promote biodiversity at OP Financial Group. The aim is to create a nature positive handprint by 2030. 'Nature positive' means that OP Financial Group's operations will have a net positive impact (NPI) on nature.\n\nOP Financial Group has also drawn up a Human Rights Statement and Human Rights Policy. OP Financial Group respects all recognised human rights, and the Human Rights Statement includes the requirements and expectations that OP Financial Group has set for itself and actors in its value chains. OP Financial Group is committed to remediation actions if it causes adverse human rights impacts.\n\nIn March 2024, OP MB published a Green Covered Bond Report on the allocation and impacts of Finland's first green covered bonds issued in March 2021 and April 2022. Under OP MB's Green Covered Bond Framework, the proceeds from the bonds have been allocated to mortgages with energy-efficient residential buildings as collateral.\n\nThe environmental impacts allocated to the green covered bonds in 2023 were 59,000 MWh of energy use avoided per year and 8,800 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions avoided per year.\n\nIn June, OP Financial Group published its updated Responsible AI policies to ensure ethical use of artificial intelligence throughout the Group.\n\nPersonnel\n\nOn 30 June 2024, OP MB had seven employees. OP MB has been digitising its operations and purchases all key support services from OP Cooperative and its Group members, reducing the need for its own personnel.\n\nOP MB's Managing Director is Sanna Eriksson. The deputy Managing Director is Tuomas Ruotsalainen, Senior Covered Bonds Manager at OP MB.\n\nRisk profile\n\nOP MB has a strong capital base, capital buffers and risk-bearing capacity. OP MB's capital base is sufficient to secure business continuity.\n\nOP MB's most significant risks are related to the quality of collateral and to the structural liquidity and interest rate risks on the balance sheet for which limits have been set in the Banking Risk Policy. The key credit risk indicators in use show that OP MB's credit risk exposure is stable. OP MB has used interest rate swaps to hedge against its interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps have been used to swap home loan interest, intermediary loan interest and interest on issued bonds onto the same basis rate. OP MB has concluded all derivative contracts for hedging purposes, applying fair value hedges which have OP Corporate Bank plc as their counterparty. OP MB's interest risk exposure is under control, and has been within the set limit.\n\nThe liquidity buffer for OP Financial Group is centrally managed by OP Corporate Bank and therefore exploitable by OP MB. At the end of the reporting period, OP Financial Group's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was 193% and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 130%. OP MB monitors its cash flows on a daily basis to secure funding liquidity, and its structural funding risk on a regular basis as part of the company's internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP). The amount of overcollateralisation in cover pools 1 and 2 clearly exceeded the minimum required under the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds.\n\nAn analysis of OP MB's risk exposure should always take account of OP Financial Group's risk exposure, which is based on the joint and several liability of all its member credit institutions. The member credit institutions are jointly liable for each other's debts. All member banks must participate in support measures, as referred to in the Act on the Amalgamation of Deposit Banks, to support each other's capital adequacy.\n\nOP Financial Group analyses the business environment as part of the ongoing risk assessment activities and strategy process. Megatrends and worldviews behind OP Financial Group's strategy reflect driving forces that affect the daily activities, conditions and future of the Group and its customers. Factors currently shaping the business environment include climate, biodiversity loss, scientific and technological innovations, polarisation, demography and geopolitics. External business environment factors are considered thoroughly, so that their effects on customers' future success are understood. OP Financial Group provides advice and makes business decisions that promote the sustainable financial success, security and wellbeing of its owner-customers and operating region while managing the Group's risk profile on a longer-term basis. Advice for customers, risk-based service sizing, contract lifecycle management, decision-making, management and reporting are based on correct and comprehensive information.\n\nOutlook for 2024\n\nThe Finnish economy was sluggish in the first half of 2024. GDP contracted over the previous year and unemployment increased. After spring, however, economic confidence has improved. Decelerating inflation and falling interest rates are paving the way for economic recovery. Risks associated with the economic outlook are still higher than usual. The escalation of geopolitical crises may abruptly affect capital markets and the economic environment.\n\nOP MB's capital adequacy is expected to remain strong, risk exposure favourable and the overall quality of the loan portfolio good. This will enable the issuance of new covered bonds in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OP_Financial_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OP Financial Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covered_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Covered bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Collateral (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capital requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corporate social responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_and_several_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint and several liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Cooperatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail Trade", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cooperatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/globenewswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762243", "eventUri": "eng-9762243", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-11-12", "textStart": 2445, "textEnd": 2461}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

The SRB has confirmed a resolution strategy for OP Financial Group whereby the resolution measures would focus on the OP amalgamation and on the new OP Corporate Bank that would be formed in case of resolution. According to the resolution strategy, OP MB will continue its operations as the new OP Corporate Bank's subsidiary.\n\nThe SRB has set a Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) for OP MB. From May 2024, the MREL is 16% of the total risk exposure amount and 18.5% of the total risk exposure amount including a combined buffer requirement, and 6% of leverage ratio exposures. The requirement entered into force on 15 May 2024. The requirement includes a Combined Buffer Requirement (CBR) of 2.5%.\n\nOP MB's buffer for the MREL requirement was EUR 215 million. The buffer consists of own funds only. OP MB clearly exceeds the MREL requirement. OP MB's MREL ratio was 46% of the total risk exposure amount.\n\nJoint and several liability of amalgamation\n\nUnder the Act on the Amalgamation of Deposit Banks, the amalgamation of cooperative banks comprises the organisation's central cooperative (OP Cooperative), the central cooperative's member credit institutions and the companies belonging to their consolidation groups, as well as credit and financial institutions and service companies in which the above together hold more than half of the total votes. This amalgamation is supervised on a consolidated basis. On 30 June 2024, OP Cooperative's member credit institutions comprised 101 OP cooperative banks, OP Corporate Bank plc, OP Mortgage Bank and OP Retail Customers plc.\n\nThe central cooperative is responsible for issuing instructions to its member credit institutions concerning their internal control and risk management, their procedures for securing liquidity and capital adequacy, and for compliance with harmonised accounting policies in the preparation of the amalgamation's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs a support measure referred to in the Act on the Amalgamation of Deposit Banks, the central cooperative is liable to pay any of its member credit institutions the amount necessary to preventing the credit institution from being placed in liquidation. The central cooperative is also liable for the debts of a member credit institution which cannot be paid using the member credit institution's assets.\n\nEach member bank is liable to pay a proportion of the amount which the central cooperative has paid to either another member bank as a support measure or to a creditor of such a member bank in payment of an overdue amount which the creditor has not received from the member bank. Furthermore, if the central cooperative defaults, a member bank has unlimited refinancing liability for the central cooperative's debts as referred to in the Co-operatives Act.\n\nEach member bank's liability for the amount the central cooperative has paid to the creditor on behalf of a member bank is divided between the member banks in proportion to their last adopted balance sheets. OP Financial Group's insurance companies do not fall within the scope of joint and several liability.\n\nAccording to section 25 of the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks (688/2010), which was valid at that time, the creditors of covered bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022 have the right to receive payment, before other claims, for the entire term of the bond, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the bond, out of the funds entered as collateral for the bond, without this being prevented by OP MB's liquidation or bankruptcy. A similar and equal priority also applies to derivative contracts entered in the register of bonds, and to marginal lending facilities referred to in section 26, subsection 4 of said Act. For mortgage-backed loans issued prior to 8 July 2022 and included in the total amount of collateral of covered bonds, the priority of the covered bond holders' payment right is limited to the amount of loan that, with respect to home loans, corresponds to 70% of the value of shares or property serving as security for the loan and entered in the bond register at the time of the issuer's liquidation or bankruptcy declaration.\n\nUnder section 20 of the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds (151/2022), which entered into force on 8 July 2022, the creditors of bonds issued after 8 July 2022, including the related management and clearing costs, have the right to receive payment from the collateral included in the cover pool, before other creditors of OP MB or the OP cooperative bank which is the debtor of an intermediary loan. A similar priority also applies to creditors of derivative contracts related to covered bonds, including the related management and clearing costs. Interest and yield accruing on the collateral, and any substitute assets, fall within the scope of said priority. Section 44, subsection 3 of the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds includes provisions on the creditor's priority claim regarding cover pool liquidity support. According to said subsection, the creditor has the right to receive payment against the funds contained in the cover pool after claims based on the principal and interest of covered bonds secured by the cover assets included in the cover pool, obligations based on derivatives contracts associated with covered bonds, as well as administration and liquidation costs.\n\nSustainability and corporate responsibility\n\nSustainability and corporate responsibility form an integral part of OP Financial Group's business and strategy, and responsible business is one of OP Financial Group's strategic priorities. The sustainability programme and its policy priorities implement OP Financial Group's strategy, and guide its sustainability and corporate responsibility actions. OP Financial Group's sustainability programme is built around three themes: Climate and the environment, People and communities and Corporate governance.\n\nAt OP Financial Group, sustainability and corporate responsibility are guided by a number of principles and policies. OP Financial Group is committed to complying not only with all applicable laws and regulations, but also with a number of international initiatives and standards guiding our operations. It is also committed to complying with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact initiative in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. Furthermore, OP Financial Group is committed to complying with the UN Principles for Responsible Investment and is a Founding Signatory of the Principles for Responsible Banking under the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).\n\nAs of the reporting year 2024, OP Financial Group reports on its sustainability and corporate responsibility in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) under the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\nOP Financial Group has drawn up a biodiversity road map that includes measures to promote biodiversity at OP Financial Group. The aim is to create a nature positive handprint by 2030. 'Nature positive' means that OP Financial Group's operations will have a net positive impact (NPI) on nature.\n\nOP Financial Group has also drawn up a Human Rights Statement and Human Rights Policy. OP Financial Group respects all recognised human rights, and the Human Rights Statement includes the requirements and expectations that OP Financial Group has set for itself and actors in its value chains. OP Financial Group is committed to remediation actions if it causes adverse human rights impacts.\n\nIn March 2024, OP MB published a Green Covered Bond Report on the allocation and impacts of Finland's first green covered bonds issued in March 2021 and April 2022. Under OP MB's Green Covered Bond Framework, the proceeds from the bonds have been allocated to mortgages with energy-efficient residential buildings as collateral.\n\nThe environmental impacts allocated to the green covered bonds in 2023 were 59,000 MWh of energy use avoided per year and 8,800 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions avoided per year.\n\nIn June, OP Financial Group published its updated Responsible AI policies to ensure ethical use of artificial intelligence throughout the Group.\n\nPersonnel\n\nOn 30 June 2024, OP MB had seven employees. OP MB has been digitising its operations and purchases all key support services from OP Cooperative and its Group members, reducing the need for its own personnel.\n\nOP MB's Managing Director is Sanna Eriksson. The deputy Managing Director is Tuomas Ruotsalainen, Senior Covered Bonds Manager at OP MB.\n\nRisk profile\n\nOP MB has a strong capital base, capital buffers and risk-bearing capacity. OP MB's capital base is sufficient to secure business continuity.\n\nOP MB's most significant risks are related to the quality of collateral and to the structural liquidity and interest rate risks on the balance sheet for which limits have been set in the Banking Risk Policy. The key credit risk indicators in use show that OP MB's credit risk exposure is stable. OP MB has used interest rate swaps to hedge against its interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps have been used to swap home loan interest, intermediary loan interest and interest on issued bonds onto the same basis rate. OP MB has concluded all derivative contracts for hedging purposes, applying fair value hedges which have OP Corporate Bank plc as their counterparty. OP MB's interest risk exposure is under control, and has been within the set limit.\n\nThe liquidity buffer for OP Financial Group is centrally managed by OP Corporate Bank and therefore exploitable by OP MB. At the end of the reporting period, OP Financial Group's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was 193% and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 130%. OP MB monitors its cash flows on a daily basis to secure funding liquidity, and its structural funding risk on a regular basis as part of the company's internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP). The amount of overcollateralisation in cover pools 1 and 2 clearly exceeded the minimum required under the Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds.\n\nAn analysis of OP MB's risk exposure should always take account of OP Financial Group's risk exposure, which is based on the joint and several liability of all its member credit institutions. The member credit institutions are jointly liable for each other's debts. All member banks must participate in support measures, as referred to in the Act on the Amalgamation of Deposit Banks, to support each other's capital adequacy.\n\nOP Financial Group analyses the business environment as part of the ongoing risk assessment activities and strategy process. Megatrends and worldviews behind OP Financial Group's strategy reflect driving forces that affect the daily activities, conditions and future of the Group and its customers. Factors currently shaping the business environment include climate, biodiversity loss, scientific and technological innovations, polarisation, demography and geopolitics. External business environment factors are considered thoroughly, so that their effects on customers' future success are understood. OP Financial Group provides advice and makes business decisions that promote the sustainable financial success, security and wellbeing of its owner-customers and operating region while managing the Group's risk profile on a longer-term basis. Advice for customers, risk-based service sizing, contract lifecycle management, decision-making, management and reporting are based on correct and comprehensive information.\n\nOutlook for 2024\n\nThe Finnish economy was sluggish in the first half of 2024. GDP contracted over the previous year and unemployment increased. After spring, however, economic confidence has improved. Decelerating inflation and falling interest rates are paving the way for economic recovery. Risks associated with the economic outlook are still higher than usual. The escalation of geopolitical crises may abruptly affect capital markets and the economic environment.\n\nOP MB's capital adequacy is expected to remain strong, risk exposure favourable and the overall quality of the loan portfolio good. This will enable the issuance of new covered bonds in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OP_Financial_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OP Financial Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covered_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Covered bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Collateral (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capital requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corporate social responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_and_several_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint and several liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Cooperatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Retail Trade", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cooperatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762243", "eventUri": "eng-9762243", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-11-12", "textStart": 2514, "textEnd": 2530}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-30", "textStart": 47, "textEnd": 57}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Unless otherwise specified, figures from 31 December 2023 are used as comparatives for balance-sheet and other cross-sectional items.\n\n* Change in ratio, percentage point(s).\n\n** OP bonuses to owner-customers, which were previously shown on a separate line in the income statement, have been divided under the following items based on their accrual: interest income, interest expenses, and commission income from mutual funds. The line 'OP bonuses to owner-customers' is no longer shown in the income statement. Comparative information has been adjusted accordingly. For more detailed information of the change, see Note 1 to this Half-year Financial Report, Accounting policies and changes in accounting policies and presentation.\n\nComments by the President and Group Chief Executive Officer:\n\nThe worst of the Finnish recession seems over, the moderate slowdown in inflation has continued as interest rates have fallen\n\nThe Finnish downturn seems to have passed its lowest point and an export and consumer-led recovery is expected later in the year. Economic growth is forecast to reach 2% next year, but this only represents a return to sluggish long-term growth trends.\n\nInflation in Finland fell to 1.3% in June and was clearly below the average for the euro area (2.5%). In the same month, the European Central Bank began to lower interest rates as expected, cutting the benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.75%. Among market rates, the 12-month Euribor remained at 3.6-3.7% in the second quarter. The slowdown in price rises and downward turn in market rates will support the economic turnaround.\n\nHome sale volumes and demand for home loans were clearly lower than a year earlier. In addition, home prices continued their moderate downward trend. However, there are signs of a positive turn in the housing market in the near future.\n\nStock markets were on an upward trend in early 2024, driven by continuously moderate global growth, improvements in corporate-sector balance sheets, and market expectations of interest-rate cuts. Stock prices in Finland underperformed compared to elsewhere in Europe, and fell far below the levels of the United States. The rise in US stock prices was driven by tech giants in particular.\n\nConstruction and the related sectors continued to be especially hard hit by the downturn. Overall risks in the real estate sector remained higher than normal, and private-sector investment was low.\n\nGeopolitical risks were high in the first half of the year, largely due to the continuation of Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza War in the Middle East. Unfortunately, there is no prospect of a rapid solution to either conflict. Uncertainty on the financial markets was sustained by elections held in several European countries, and their surprising results. However, the global economic outlook improved in early 2024, with indicators suggesting a gradual recovery.\n\nOP Financial Group's businesses continued to grow strongly - the excellent result will secure the continuance of competitive benefits for owner-customers\n\nDespite the sluggish business environment, OP Financial Group's operating profit continued to develop extremely well in the second quarter. Operating profit for the first half of 2024 grew by 25% from a year earlier, to EUR 1,229 million. Our strong profit performance guarantees highly competitive benefits for our owner-customers. We will pay 40% extra on OP bonuses earned in 2024 compared to the 2022 level, and will not require owner-customers to pay monthly fees for daily services throughout the year. Together, these benefits will add up to around EUR 400 million in value for our owner-customers.\n\nBeing customer-owned, OP Financial Group will continue to share its financial success through a range of financial and other benefits for its 2.1 million owner-customers. We are ready for possible changes in the taxation of customer bonuses in the financial sector. OP Financial Group's owner-customers will continue to receive at least the same level of financial benefits as before, regardless of any changes in legislation. It therefore pays to be an owner-customer of OP Financial Group.\n\nIn the first six months of 2024, OP Financial Group's CET1 ratio strengthened again, to 20.8%, which exceeds the minimum regulatory requirement by 7.5 percentage points. OP Financial Group is one of Europe's most financially solid large banks. Excellent profitability and strong capital adequacy and liquidity are critical factors for banks and insurance companies, building trust among customers, partners and other stakeholders. The importance of these factors is highlighted during economically challenging and otherwise uncertain times.\n\nOP Financial Group's income from customer business continued to grow in the first half of 2024, mainly due to the strong increase in net interest income. Both deposit funding and wholesale funding costs clearly rose year on year. Net commissions and fees decreased by 11%, chiefly due to the benefit (provided for owner-customers) of zero monthly charges for daily banking services.\n\nThe insurance service result for January to June 2024 was clearly better than in the previous year, increasing to EUR 37 million. Early in the year, claims expenditure was increased by several large claims and the profitability of health insurance was poor. However, growth in claims expenditure slowed in the second quarter and the insurance service result markedly improved, turning positive.\n\nIncome from investment activities developed extremely well throughout the first half of 2024 - the result of EUR 269 million was 7% higher than for the same period in 2023. Total income was EUR 2,400 million, or 11% more than during the equivalent period in the previous year.\n\nOP Financial Group's expenses were EUR 1,104 million in January-June, growing by 2% year on year. The key factor in cost performance was the reduction of EUR 62 million in stability contributions. Without this effect, expenses would have grown by 9% compared to the first half of 2023. This underlying rise in expenses was chiefly the result of rising personnel costs and higher investments in ICT development. OP Financial Group's cost/income ratio markedly improved year on year, to the excellent level of 46%.\n\nAll three business segments performed well during the reporting period. Growth was particularly strong in the Retail Banking segment, with operating profit rising by 31% to EUR 685 million, following favourable developments in net interest income. Corporate Banking's operating profit improved considerably, by 25% to EUR 275 million. Operating profit in the Insurance segment was EUR 267 million. This was 23% higher year on year, largely because of the excellent result in investment income.\n\nDeposits began to grow gently, while the loan portfolio slightly contracted - there were faint signs of deterioration in customers' loan repayment capacity\n\nThe deposit portfolio grew by 3% year on year. There was moderate growth in household and corporate deposits alike. OP Financial Group retained its clear position as the market-leading deposit bank in Finland.\n\nOP Financial Group's loan portfolio shrank by 1% year on year. Demand for new home loans and corporate loans continued to be low. OP Financial Group remained a strong market leader in home loans and corporate loans. Despite higher interest rates, most of our home loan customers have been repaying their loans diligently and on schedule. Although the number of loan modification applications was lower than in the first half of 2023, there was slight growth in the number of household loans being transferred to debt collection. Moreover, there was a rise in the number of corporate customers with non-performing loans in construction and the real estate sector in general. As the economy slowed in early 2024, expected credit loss and non-performing exposures grew a little. However, impairment loss on receivables reduced somewhat compared to a year earlier.\n\nOP Financial Group is investing strongly in wealth management\n\nHanna Porkka, our new Executive Vice President, Wealth Management (and a member of OP Cooperative's Executive Management Team) began in her post at the start of April. This appointment is part of OP Financial Group's strategic investment in the development and growth of its wealth management services. We aim to make a clear growth leap in this business: in line with our aim of coaching our customers to make better financial choices, we are investing heavily in the range, quality and availability of the wealth management services we provide to meet the needs of our various customer categories. We want to promote our customers' long-term financial wellbeing.\n\nOur customers were interested in systematically investing in funds, with 39% more new systematic investment agreements being made than in the same period last year. The number of OP mutual fund unitholders continued to rise and exceeded 1.3 million. There was also clear growth in the number of active equity investors. Reaching more than EUR 109 billion in value, investment assets managed by OP Financial Group grew by 10% year on year.\n\nThe insurance business's profitability improved in the second quarter\n\nInsurance revenue grew by 8%, year on year, in the first six months of 2024. The rapid growth in claims expenditure of early 2024 slowed in the second quarter, but claims expenditure was still 11% higher than in the same period in 2023. At 71%, the non-life insurance risk ratio was 3 percentage points higher than in the previous year. Compensation was paid for 94% of all claims reported to Pohjola Insurance. The profitability of non-life insurance in the second quarter clearly improved on that of the first quarter.\n\nOP Life Assurance's performance in early 2024 was excellent, with 8% growth in unit-linked insurance assets since the year began. Kristiina Michelsson, the new Managing Director of OP Life Assurance, began work in her post at the start of May. This business is one of OP Financial Group's strategic focus areas.\n\nArtificial intelligence will enable better services for our customers and provide our employees with new, productivity-improving tools\n\nWe are now investing more in ICT, particularly the development of data protection and cybersecurity. The generative AI transition could transform society even more and faster than the Internet did in its day. OP Financial Group aims to be a pioneer in using AI in its customer business and improving the productivity and quality of various functions. We are also strongly investing in reinforcement of our employees' AI competencies.\n\nIn June, we launched OP Aina, a new personal assistant on OP-mobile. OP Aina helps our customers with a range of banking and insurance matters on a 24/7 basis. OP Aina is the first Finnish financial-sector service based on AI and alerts - we are using it to provide our customers with more personalised and easily available services than before.\n\nWe have something in common\n\nOP Financial Group is in a strong position to support its customers through economic upturns and downturns. We want to be a pioneer in Finnish society, showing the way towards a better tomorrow. The success of Finland and all those who live there is our number one priority.\n\nMy warm thanks to all our customers for the trust you have shown in OP Financial Group. We aim to continue being worthy of the confidence you place in us. I would also like to thank our employees and governing bodies for their excellent work in the first half of 2024. This is a strong position from which to go forward.\n\nOP Financial Group's operating profit was EUR 1,229 million (986), up by EUR 243 million year on year. Income from customer business, or net interest income, net commissions and fees and insurance service result, increased by a total of 11.4% to EUR 1,844 million (1,656). The cost/income ratio improved to 46.0% (49.9). New OP bonuses accrued to owner-customers, which are included in earnings, increased by 14.8% to EUR 154 million.\n\nNet interest income grew by 17.6% to EUR 1,407 million. The development of market rates continued to increase net interest income. Net interest income reported by the Retail Banking segment increased by 21.8% to EUR 1,092 million and that by the Corporate Banking segment increased by 14.8% to EUR 328 million. OP Financial Group's loan portfolio decreased by 0.8% to EUR 97.7 billion while deposits grew by 2.8% to EUR 75.3 billion, year on year. Household deposits increased by 1.7% year on year, to EUR 47.8 billion. New loans drawn down by customers during the reporting period totalled EUR 10.4 billion (10.9).\n\nImpairment loss on loans and receivables, which reduces earnings, totalled EUR 67 million (99). Final credit losses totalled EUR 25 million (32). At the end of the reporting period, loss allowance was EUR 971 million (929), of which management overlay accounted for EUR 105 million (109). Non-performing exposures accounted for 3.0% (2.9) of total exposures. Impairment loss on loans and receivables accounted for 0.13% (0.19) of the loan and guarantee portfolio.\n\nNet commissions and fees decreased by 11.4% to EUR 400 million. Owner-customers have got daily banking services without monthly charges since October 2023. This contributed to the decrease in payment transfer net commissions and fees. Net commissions and fees for payment transfer services decreased by EUR 42 million to EUR 113 million, and those for residential brokerage by EUR 4 million to EUR 27 million. Net commissions and fees for mutual funds decreased by EUR 3 million to EUR 91 million.\n\nInsurance service result increased by EUR 29 million to EUR 37 million. Insurance service result includes EUR 263 million (237) in operating expenses. Non-life insurance net insurance revenue including reinsurer's share grew by 7.0% to EUR 844 million. Net claims incurred after reinsurer's share grew by 11.0% to EUR 597 million. Combined ratio reported by non-life insurance weakened to 100.4% (97.6).\n\nInvestment income, or net investment income, net insurance finance expenses and income from financial assets held for trading, increased by a total of 7.5% to EUR 269 million. Investment income grew as a result of the increase in the value of equity investments. Net investment income together with net finance income describe investment profitability in the insurance business. The combined return on investments at fair value of OP Financial Group's insurance companies was 2.6% (3.4).\n\nNet income from financial assets recognised at fair value through profit or loss, or notes and bonds, shares and derivatives, totalled EUR 1,034 million (762). Net income from investment contract liabilities totalled EUR -523 million (-300). Net insurance finance expenses totalled EUR -272 million (-253).\n\nIn banking, net income from financial assets held for trading decreased by 10.5% to EUR 17 million due to the decrease in interest income from notes and bonds.\n\nOther operating income increased to EUR 25 million (21).\n\nTotal expenses increased by 2.3% to EUR 1,104 million. Personnel costs rose by 10.5% to EUR 535 million. The increase was affected by headcount growth and pay increases. OP Financial Group's personnel increased by 1,000 year on year. Depreciation/amortisation and impairment loss on PPE and intangible assets decreased by 24.7% to EUR 69 million. Other operating expenses remained at the previous year's level at EUR 501 million. ICT costs totalled EUR 252 million (207). Development costs were EUR 171 million (127) and capitalised development expenditure EUR 31 million (50). Charges of financial authorities fell by EUR 62 million to EUR 1 million. The EU's Single Resolution Board (SRB) will not collect stability contributions from banks for 2024. In 2023, OP Financial Group paid a total of EUR 62 million in stability contributions.\n\nOP bonuses to owner-customers, which were previously shown on a separate line in the income statement, have been divided under the following items based on their accrual: EUR 76 million (71) under interest income, EUR 40 million (32) under interest expenses, and EUR 23 million (19) under commission income from mutual funds. The line 'OP bonuses to owner-customers' is no longer shown in the income statement. Comparative information has been adjusted accordingly. For more detailed information of the change, see Note 1 to this Half-year Financial Report, Accounting policies and changes in accounting policies and presentation.\n\nIncome tax amounted to EUR 244 million (196). The effective tax rate for the reporting period was 19.9% (19.9). Comprehensive income after tax totalled EUR 1,031 million (803).\n\nOP Financial Group's equity amounted to EUR 17.0 billion (16.3). Equity included EUR 3.2 billion (3.3) in Profit Shares, terminated Profit Shares accounting for EUR 0.2 billion (0.4).\n\nOP Financial Group's funding position and liquidity is strong. At the end of the reporting period, the Group's LCR was 193% (199) and NSFR was 130% (130).\n\nOutlook towards the year end\n\nThe Finnish economy was sluggish in the first half of 2024. GDP contracted over the previous year and unemployment increased. After spring, however, economic confidence has improved. Decelerating inflation and falling interest rates are paving the way for economic recovery. Risks associated with the economic outlook are still higher than usual. The escalation of geopolitical crises may abruptly affect capital markets and the economic environment.\n\nOP Financial Group's operating profit for 2024 is expected to be at a good level but lower than that for 2023.\n\nThe most significant uncertainties affecting OP Financial Group's earnings performance are associated with developments in the business environment, changes in the interest rate and investment environment and developments in impairment loss on receivables. Forward-looking statements in this Half-year Financial Report expressing the management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions are based on the current view on developments in the economy, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.\n\nPress conference\n\nOP Financial Group's financial performance will be

But it wasn't until the comments that the full truth behind her feelings came out.\n\nThe anonymous woman shared most of her story with Reddit's infamous AITA (\"Am I the A--hole\") forum, but readers didn't quite get a complete understanding of her situation until she started replying to them in the comments.\n\nThere was definitely a lot more going on under the surface than a mother, a daughter, a birthday dinner and some missing half-siblings -- and it left Redditors feeling heartbroken, frustrated, and angry.\n\nRead on to hear the first version of her story, but then keep going to find out what was really going on underneath it all.\n\n\"My mom turned turned 60 last week and I took her out to dinner to celebrate,\" OP started her story. \"It was her, me (21f), my girlfriend (22f) and my mom's best friend. I also spent most of that day with her and we went shopping, etc.\"\n\n\"During dinner she talked about how my half siblings should have come,\" she continued. \"I told her she had the option to invite them if she wanted them there but I couldn't and wouldn't make contact with them.\" That's where the heart of this emerging drama stems from.\n\nOP explained her choice of words by adding, \"Couldn't, because I have no contact info for them and we are not social media friends. Wouldn't because they have been very clear they want no contact with me.\"\n\nShe then offered some background as to how the family wound up this way. \"My mom was happily married to my half siblings dad and they were a happy family. Then he died,\" she wrote. \"My half siblings were 12 and under at the time.\"\n\nThey did not want me to exist. They did not want another reminder that their dad was gone\n\nWhat happened from there was a series of failed marriage for the mom and five years later, OP was born. \"My half siblings didn't see me as a sibling or as a member of their family. They view me, have always always viewed me, as an accident,\" she explained. \"As someone who should [n]ever have existed.\"\n\n\"They did not want me to exist. They did not want another reminder that their dad was gone and mom was throwing herself at all kinds of men,\" OP continued. \"They wanted a neater family, where all the siblings had the same two parents.\"\n\nAs a result, OP said she's had minimal contact with her half-siblings, who mostly \"ignored\" her when she was younger. \"It was rough being on the outside when I was small,\" she admitted, adding that their mother \"was never very stable or steady.\"\n\n\"The contact with my half siblings lessened so much over time. They are not very close to mom either. But they check in on her from time to time. They speak to her occasionally. They send cards and stuff for birthdays and Christmas, for her though and not me,\" OP added.\n\nShe wrote that she \"attempted to make contact when I moved out by sending a follow request on social media, but they never accepted. That was it.\"\n\nWith the full background established, OP returned to the birthday dinner with her mother. \"During dinner she kept saying how I should reach out, how we should be close, I should have invited them and all kinds of stuff like that,\" wrote OP. \"I told her they wanted nothing to do with me and could she please drop it.\"\n\n\"She kept pushing and especially on the topic of my relationship with them,\" she continued. \"We all tried to change the subject. When she wouldn't let it go my girlfriend and I left early, without finishing, because I was done.\"\n\nOP then shared, \"My mom was crying down the phone to me the next day and the day after that asking how I could leave her.\" And with that, she wondered: AITA for leaving my mom on her birthday because she wouldn't stop talking about my half siblings?\n\nAs it turns out, OP had not nearly divulged the entirety of the story in her post, but she repeatedly expressed it in her responses to the comments she received. That is that she doesn't feel loved by her mother, either, or at the least not nearly as loved as her half-siblings, because of their connection to their late father.\n\nOne commenter got the attention of OP with a message where they acknowledged the overall messiness of the situation, and how poorly OP had been treated by the mother and half-siblings. \"View spending time with your mom and being able to take hard conversations with her like this on the chin as proof that you are better than your half siblings,\" they suggested. \"You are present and trying while they have completely disappeared.\"\n\nBut OP explained that she \"can't take that stuff on the chin though.\" She wrote that \"it always serves as a reminder that I do not feel loved by my mom. I don't think she hates me. But I don't remember a time she has ever said she loves me.\"\n\nChildren are not meant to fix the emotional needs of parents\n\nTo make matters worse, OP wrote, \"I have heard her say it to my half siblings. I have heard her say it about them. But to memory I don't remember her saying it to me. Maybe she does say it and I can't hear it. But I always felt like she saw me a mistake too and the only difference was she didn't say it outright or show it as clearly as my half siblings did.\"\n\nShe did clarify that while there's a lot to unpack in her relationship with her mother, she does love her. \"I love her. I do. But I don't fee loved in return,\" she wrote. \"And I don't have it in me to take the pressure and the blame for things not working the way mom wants them to.\"\n\nMost Redditors disagreed, though, believing that OP was perfectly within her rights to have had enough and removed herself from the situation. \"She wasn't just 'talking about' your half-siblings. She was repeatedly pressuring you, to try to get you to pressure your half-siblings into a connection,\" wrote one.\n\n\"You didn't walk out when she started on it again. It took several times of trying to change the subject and get her to leave off the pressure.\"\n\n\"As much as I try to be a good daughter, I don't think I was ever loved by her or at least not like she loves her first three children who are the children of the man she loves,\" wrote OP, adding in another comment she wants to protect her future children so they don't \"feel lesser for being the grandkids of the wrong grandfather.\"\n\n\"I don't want that for them because being from the wrong person, even though it's not your fault, is an awful burden,\" she wrote.\n\nWith OP continuing to express her love for her mother, telling one Redditor, \"She's really all I have re family,\" there were some who were encouraging her to give herself the same care she plans to give her children.\n\nI don't think she hates me. But I don't remember a time she has ever said she loves me.\n\n\"Children are not meant to fix the emotional needs of parents,\" wrote one commenter. \"This poor OP has had a parent who has been emotionally immature their entire life. It isn't their job to fix mom or her life. OP needs to start prioritizing themselves NTA.\"\n\nThey also went in pretty hard on the mom in general for how she handled the whole situation. \"She's not acknowledging your half-siblings' resentful behavior towards you - like you have some control over the fact that you aren't in contact with them.

It sheds light on the risks and regulations associated with digital asset investments. The user, who shared their story on Xiaohongshu, detailed a tumultuous journey with Bitcoin (BTC) and the U.S. exchange. Moreover, he raised concerns about account security and property rights.\n\nIn 2017, the investor, referred to as the original poster (OP), allocated approximately \u00a5200,000 in savings to Bitcoin. Their initial investment strategy was simple: \"Buy BTC and hold long-term, either it soars or crashes.\" However, the unpredictable nature of the crypto market soon led the OP down a path of frequent trading and asset diversification. This resulted in significant financial losses. By early 2018, the OP's holdings had dwindled from 2 BTC to 0.5 BTC due to speculative trades in various altcoins.\n\nAfter enduring the volatile market, the OP consolidated their remaining assets back into BTC and held onto it until 2020. Despite a brief recovery during the 2021 Bitcoin surge, further trading between BTC, USDT, and other tokens resulted in a reduced holding of 0.23 BTC. Concerned about the security of platforms like Huobi and Binance, the OP transferred their assets to Coinbase in late 2021.\n\nHowever, the situation took a dire turn in June 2024 when the OP discovered their account was inaccessible. Upon contacting the exchange's customer service, they learned that their account had been closed and their Bitcoin sold and transferred to an institution in Wyoming. The reason cited was that the account had been deemed \"unclaimed property\" due to inactivity.\n\nHowever, the OP asserted they had logged in as recently as February and March 2024. CEX's policy, aligned with state laws, considers accounts inactive for 3-5 years as unclaimed property. Hence, the OP's login evidence was dismissed by customer service, which advised them to contact Wyoming's Unclaimed Property Division.\n\nAlso Read: BlackRock Ethereum ETF Wallet Gets 76,669 ETH From Coinbase\n\nThe above-mentioned revelation sparked outrage and sympathy among fellow crypto enthusiasts. One Reddit user emphasized the importance of maintaining control over one's digital assets..they wrote, \"Again proving, Not your keys, Not your coin.\" This sentiment was echoed by the OP, who admitted, \"Very true.\"\n\nAnother user suggested potential legal recourse against the U.S.-based crypto exchange. They wrote, \"As a public company, there are many ways to deal with them. 1. Sue Coinbase's management and company, demanding returns and compensation. 2. Write complaints to the SEC, FINRA, and PCAOB. They can easily penalize Coinbase with millions in fines.\"\n\nA contrasting perspective was offered by another user, who explained the legal framework in the U.S. Moreover, they indicated that a full recovery was indeed possible even though the OP believes he has \"zero chances\" of getting the funds back. They wrote, \"In the U.S., if a financial account is inactive for two years, it automatically goes to unclaimed property. No one is robbing you. You can just apply to get it back.\"\n\nIndeed, the silver lining in this ordeal is the possibility of reclaiming the unclaimed property. \"Unclaimed property can be reclaimed as long as you can prove your identity. It's actually meant to protect everyone,\" assured another commenter.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)\n\nTOPEKA -- A federal judge granted an Overland Park nonprofit organization's request for a temporary restraining order blocking the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission from enforcing a campaign finance law until a trial on constitutionality of the state's definition of a political action committee.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Daniel Crabtree issued the order Wednesday on behalf of Fresh Vision OP, which ran afoul of the state commission in 2021 after sending a mailer endorsing the candidacy of Faris Farassati, an Overland Park City Council member campaigning for mayor. Fresh Vision OP posted comparable information to its website. The organization also opposed use of \"tax give aways,\" incentives for economic development and tolling on U.S. 69.\n\nFresh Vision OP's attorneys, including lawyers with the Institute for Free Speech, filed a lawsuit challenging the state's definition of a PAC. The plaintiff's attorneys argued the law could be interpreted to include groups such as Fresh Vision OP that were organized primarily for a neighborhood's benefit, but also periodically endorsed candidates. The lawsuit was designed to protect free speech rights of Fresh Vision OP and organizations like it, plaintiffs said.\n\nCrabtree's temporary restraining order would allow Fresh Vision OP to resume community advocacy activities without being regulated at a PAC.\n\nThe judge said the state's definition of a PAC would likely be found to violate the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo, which said express advocacy had to be \"the major purpose\" of an organization to be regarded as a PAC. The order said the statute in question was written in a way that applied PAC requirements without first determining whether that organization's express advocacy was \"a singular major purpose\" or the major purpose.\n\n\"After considering the statutory scheme and the parties' arguments and submissions, the court grants a narrowed temporary restraining order,\" Crabtree wrote in the order.\n\nA court hearing on the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction and a trial on merits of the case has been scheduled for September.\n\n\"The court applied existing precedent that bars the imposition of burdensome political committee requirements on groups that only occasionally engage in express advocacy,\" said Charles Miller, an attorney with Institute for Free Speech. \"Those requirements chill and potentially punish protected political speech.\"\n\nLawsuit plaintiffs James Muir and Chengny Thao, who served as officers of Fresh Vision OP, sought to have the federal court block the state Governmental Ethics Commission from enforcing laws and regulations that appeared to violate their First Amendment rights to speech.\n\nThey have contended Fresh Vision OP engaged in public activism and education to promote wholesome neighborhoods, local small business growth, public safety and responsible land development. In July 2021, the organization endorsed Farassati's candidacy for mayor on its website and in a mailer.\n\nThe state ethics commission responded by notifying Fresh Vision OP that the endorsements equated to operation as a political action committee and required the organization to register in the state.\n\nThe letter advised Fresh Vision OP that it could face civil fines and criminal penalties for failing to comply with state campaign finance law. Fresh Vision OP suspended operations to avoid regulation as a political committee and disclosure of donors to the organization.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overland_Park,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overland Park, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Overland Park, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Free_Speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institute for Free Speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Topeka, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Topeka, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buckley v.

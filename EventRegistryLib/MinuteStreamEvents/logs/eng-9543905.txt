The fast-evolving landscape of the demonstrations is shaping pivotal Senate races, too.\n\nTent encampments have popped up at universities in many states where Democrats this election year are defending seats essential to maintaining the party's razor-thin Senate majority. At some schools, police crackdowns and arrests have followed.\n\nThe protests have sharpened the campaign rhetoric in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan, among other places. Republican candidates in California and Florida have stepped up their criticism of the Democratic president for the U.S. response to the war or for chaotic scenes on American campuses.\n\nSome Republicans have shown up at encampments, including one at George Washington University, not far from the White House. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "journalnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winston-Salem Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@journalnow.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "matt_rourke@journalnow.com", "name": "Matt Rourke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@journalnow.com", "name": "J.

Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nA visual history of campus protests in the US A visual history of campus protests in the US 1933: Columbia University students strike in defense of 'academic freedom' 1940: Students for Peace protest America's involvement in WWII 1968: UC Berkeley's anti-draft 'Vietnam Commencement' 1968: Howard University students call for radical administration change 1968: Students for a Democratic Society occupies Hamilton Hall at Columbia University 1969: Black Student Strike at the UW Madison 1969: Central State University students assemble in Columbus, Ohio, to oppose admissions policies 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 1970: Protests erupt following Kent State shootings 1970: Students protest racial injustice at Jackson State College 1985: Students camp out at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall to protest apartheid 1999: University of Minnesota students demand action regarding sexual conduct investigations 2014: Washington University students protest to draw attention to police abuse 2017: Emerson College students walk out to protest on-campus racism 2018: Student activists lead 'die-in' protesting gun violence at NYU A visual history of campus protests in the US 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@nwitimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "matt_rourke@nwitimes.com", "name": "Matt Rourke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jose_luis_magana@nwitimes.com", "name": "Jose Luis Magana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@nwitimes.com", "name": "J.

The fast-evolving landscape of the demonstrations is shaping pivotal Senate races, too.\n\nTent encampments have popped up at universities in many states where Democrats this election year are defending seats essential to maintaining the party's razor-thin Senate majority. At some schools, police crackdowns and arrests have followed.\n\nThe protests have sharpened the campaign rhetoric in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan, among other places. Republican candidates in California and Florida have stepped up their criticism of the Democratic president for the U.S. response to the war or for chaotic scenes on American campuses.\n\nSome Republicans have shown up at encampments, including one at George Washington University, not far from the White House. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nA visual history of campus protests in the US A visual history of campus protests in the US 1933: Columbia University students strike in defense of 'academic freedom' 1940: Students for Peace protest America's involvement in WWII 1968: UC Berkeley's anti-draft 'Vietnam Commencement' 1968: Howard University students call for radical administration change 1968: Students for a Democratic Society occupies Hamilton Hall at Columbia University 1969: Black Student Strike at the UW Madison 1969: Central State University students assemble in Columbus, Ohio, to oppose admissions policies 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 1970: Protests erupt following Kent State shootings 1970: Students protest racial injustice at Jackson State College 1985: Students camp out at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall to protest apartheid 1999: University of Minnesota students demand action regarding sexual conduct investigations 2014: Washington University students protest to draw attention to police abuse 2017: Emerson College students walk out to protest on-campus racism 2018: Student activists lead 'die-in' protesting gun violence at NYU A visual history of campus protests in the US 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "matt_rourke@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Matt Rourke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jose_luis_magana@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Jose Luis Magana", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@dothaneagle.com", "name": "J.

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nA visual history of campus protests in the US A visual history of campus protests in the US 1933: Columbia University students strike in defense of 'academic freedom' 1940: Students for Peace protest America's involvement in WWII 1968: UC Berkeley's anti-draft 'Vietnam Commencement' 1968: Howard University students call for radical administration change 1968: Students for a Democratic Society occupies Hamilton Hall at Columbia University 1969: Black Student Strike at the UW Madison 1969: Central State University students assemble in Columbus, Ohio, to oppose admissions policies 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 1970: Protests erupt following Kent State shootings 1970: Students protest racial injustice at Jackson State College 1985: Students camp out at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall to protest apartheid 1999: University of Minnesota students demand action regarding sexual conduct investigations 2014: Washington University students protest to draw attention to police abuse 2017: Emerson College students walk out to protest on-campus racism 2018: Student activists lead 'die-in' protesting gun violence at NYU A visual history of campus protests in the US 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pantagraph.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "paul_sancya@pantagraph.com", "name": "Paul Sancya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@pantagraph.com", "name": "J.

Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that in their view tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, US Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended that statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nThey called out Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nLater, at a news conference, Brown gave more expansive comments. \"Students want to make their voices heard, they need to do it in a way that's nonviolent, they need to do it in a way that doesn't spew hatred, and laws need to be enforced,\" he said.\n\nIn Michigan, which has a relatively significant Muslim population, Biden's handling of the war is expected to factor heavily into the presidential and Senate races.\n\nRogers, a favorite for the GOP nomination, thanked New York City police for confronting protesters and \"standing up to protect Jewish students at Columbia from the visceral hatred we've witnessed from Hamas sympathizers on their campus.\"\n\nRepublicans argued that US Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for Senate, had not spoken out strongly against protests at Columbia, her alma mater, and that she took five days after they began to say anything at all.\n\nSlotkin, who is Jewish, said in an April 22 statement -- the most recent wave of demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 -- that \"the use of intimidation, antisemitic signs or slogans, or harassment, is unacceptable.\"\n\nIt was, she suggested, a complicated topic.\n\n\"I would rather be thoughtful and take more time than have a knee-jerk answer for any issue,\" Slotkin said in an interview. \"But especially this one.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The fast-evolving landscape of the demonstrations is shaping pivotal Senate races, too.\n\nTent encampments have popped up at universities in many states where Democrats this election year are defending seats essential to maintaining the party's razor-thin Senate majority. At some schools, police crackdowns and arrests have followed.\n\nThe protests have sharpened the campaign rhetoric in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan, among other places. Republican candidates in California and Florida have stepped up their criticism of the Democratic president for the U.S. response to the war or for chaotic scenes on American campuses.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition.

The fast-evolving landscape of the demonstrations is shaping pivotal Senate races, too.\n\nTent encampments have popped up at universities in many states where Democrats this election year are defending seats essential to maintaining the party's razor-thin Senate majority. At some schools, police crackdowns and arrests have followed.\n\nThe protests have sharpened the campaign rhetoric in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan, among other places. Republican candidates in California and Florida have stepped up their criticism of the Democratic president for the U.S. response to the war or for chaotic scenes on American campuses.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nA visual history of campus protests in the US A visual history of campus protests in the US 1933: Columbia University students strike in defense of 'academic freedom' 1940: Students for Peace protest America's involvement in WWII 1968: UC Berkeley's anti-draft 'Vietnam Commencement' 1968: Howard University students call for radical administration change 1968: Students for a Democratic Society occupies Hamilton Hall at Columbia University 1969: Black Student Strike at the UW Madison 1969: Central State University students assemble in Columbus, Ohio, to oppose admissions policies 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 1970: Protests erupt following Kent State shootings 1970: Students protest racial injustice at Jackson State College 1985: Students camp out at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall to protest apartheid 1999: University of Minnesota students demand action regarding sexual conduct investigations 2014: Washington University students protest to draw attention to police abuse 2017: Emerson College students walk out to protest on-campus racism 2018: Student activists lead 'die-in' protesting gun violence at NYU A visual history of campus protests in the US 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "mcdowellnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McDowellNews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@mcdowellnews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "paul_sancya@mcdowellnews.com", "name": "Paul Sancya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@mcdowellnews.com", "name": "J.

The fast-evolving landscape of the demonstrations is shaping pivotal Senate races, too.\n\nTent encampments have popped up at universities in many states where Democrats this election year are defending seats essential to maintaining the party's razor-thin Senate majority. At some schools, police crackdowns and arrests have followed.\n\nThe protests have sharpened the campaign rhetoric in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan, among other places. Republican candidates in California and Florida have stepped up their criticism of the Democratic president for the U.S. response to the war or for chaotic scenes on American campuses.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nA visual history of campus protests in the US A visual history of campus protests in the US 1933: Columbia University students strike in defense of 'academic freedom' 1940: Students for Peace protest America's involvement in WWII 1968: UC Berkeley's anti-draft 'Vietnam Commencement' 1968: Howard University students call for radical administration change 1968: Students for a Democratic Society occupies Hamilton Hall at Columbia University 1969: Black Student Strike at the UW Madison 1969: Central State University students assemble in Columbus, Ohio, to oppose admissions policies 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 1970: Protests erupt following Kent State shootings 1970: Students protest racial injustice at Jackson State College 1985: Students camp out at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall to protest apartheid 1999: University of Minnesota students demand action regarding sexual conduct investigations 2014: Washington University students protest to draw attention to police abuse 2017: Emerson College students walk out to protest on-campus racism 2018: Student activists lead 'die-in' protesting gun violence at NYU A visual history of campus protests in the US 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "journalstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JournalStar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@journalstar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "matt_rourke@journalstar.com", "name": "Matt Rourke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "paul_sancya@journalstar.com", "name": "Paul Sancya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@journalstar.com", "name": "J.

The fast-evolving landscape of the demonstrations is shaping pivotal Senate races, too.\n\nTent encampments have popped up at universities in many states where Democrats this election year are defending seats essential to maintaining the party's razor-thin Senate majority. At some schools, police crackdowns and arrests have followed.\n\nThe protests have sharpened the campaign rhetoric in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan, among other places. Republican candidates in California and Florida have stepped up their criticism of the Democratic president for the U.S. response to the war or for chaotic scenes on American campuses.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nA visual history of campus protests in the US A visual history of campus protests in the US 1933: Columbia University students strike in defense of 'academic freedom' 1940: Students for Peace protest America's involvement in WWII 1968: UC Berkeley's anti-draft 'Vietnam Commencement' 1968: Howard University students call for radical administration change 1968: Students for a Democratic Society occupies Hamilton Hall at Columbia University 1969: Black Student Strike at the UW Madison 1969: Central State University students assemble in Columbus, Ohio, to oppose admissions policies 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 1970: Protests erupt following Kent State shootings 1970: Students protest racial injustice at Jackson State College 1985: Students camp out at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall to protest apartheid 1999: University of Minnesota students demand action regarding sexual conduct investigations 2014: Washington University students protest to draw attention to police abuse 2017: Emerson College students walk out to protest on-campus racism 2018: Student activists lead 'die-in' protesting gun violence at NYU A visual history of campus protests in the US 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "qctimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Quad-City Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@qctimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@qctimes.com", "name": "J.

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is facing reelection, said on social media that he went there to show solidarity with Jewish students. \"We need to do all we can to protect them,\" he said.\n\nRepublican candidate David McCormick, during a visit to the University of Pennsylvania, said protesters at the Ivy League school did not know the \"difference between right and wrong, good and evil,\" and were creating a hostile atmosphere for Jewish students.\n\nMcCormick decried what he frames as a lack of leadership and moral clarity on the part of his Democratic opponent, Sen. Bob Casey, as well as by Biden and administrators at the school buffeted by accusations of harboring antisemitism.\n\n\"What's happening on campuses is clearly a test of leadership and moral courage, both for the college presidents and for our leaders and for Sen. Casey and President Biden,\" McCormick said in an interview.\n\nIsrael and its supporters say the protests are antisemitic, a charge that Israel's critics say is sometimes used to silence legitimate opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at trying to save the lives of Palestinian civilians.\n\nMany Democrats, from Biden on down, avoided saying much about the situation until recently as universities began to crack down and comparisons were made to anti-war protests of the 1960s.\n\nEven then, Democrats balanced their criticism of antisemitism and rule-breakers with the need to protect the right to free expression and peaceful protest. Some have tried to avoid taking sides in protests that have pitted pro-Israeli versus pro-Palestinian Democrats and divided important parts of the party's base, including Jewish, Arab American and younger voters.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have railed at what they characterized as equivocating or silence by Democrats. Republicans professed solidarity with Jews against antisemitism while condemning the protests as lawless.\n\nMike Rogers, a Republican seeking an open Senate seat in Michigan, said student protesters at Columbia were \"Hamas sympathizers.\" In California, GOP Senate candidate Steve Garvey called them \"terrorists\" practicing \"terrorism disguised as free speech.\"\n\nIn five states, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, is using the protests in digital ads about student loan forgiveness, saying Democrats want to pay off the loans of students \"radicalized by the far left\" who are \"threatening Jews,\" \"attacking police\" and \"acting like terrorists.\"\n\nMcCormick and others say universities that, in their view, tolerate antisemitism should lose federal subsidies and that visas should be revoked for any foreign student inciting violence or expressing pro-Hamas sentiments at the encampments.\n\nCasey, long a staunch supporter of Israel, has criticized acts of antisemitism on campuses and pointed to legislation he sponsored as a way to make sure the Education Department takes action.\n\n\"Students of course have the right to peacefully protest, but when it crosses the line either into violence or discrimination, then we have an obligation to step in and stop that conduct,\" Casey said Thursday as he urged colleagues to pass his bill.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who is Jewish and facing reelection, said she was \"horrified\" by displays of antisemitism on campuses and, like Casey, called for the department to hold schools accountable.\n\nIn California, U.S. Rep Adam Schiff, the Democratic nominee for an open Senate seat, took aim at the Columbia demonstration and said \"antisemitic and hateful rhetoric is being loudly and proudly displayed.\" Accused by Garvey of being \"incredibly silent\" on the protests, Schiff, who is Jewish, voted for a House bill similar to Casey's and released a statement that condemned violence and the \"explicit, repeated targeting and intimidation of Jewish students.\"\n\nRepublicans elsewhere contended statements by Democrats were equivocating and inadequate.\n\nRepublicans called out Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, after he told an Axios reporter last week that he was \"not going to talk about the politics of that. People always have the right to speak out and should.\"\n\nHis Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, charged that Brown had \"wholeheartedly endorsed these vile and violent antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\nA visual history of campus protests in the US A visual history of campus protests in the US 1933: Columbia University students strike in defense of 'academic freedom' 1940: Students for Peace protest America's involvement in WWII 1968: UC Berkeley's anti-draft 'Vietnam Commencement' 1968: Howard University students call for radical administration change 1968: Students for a Democratic Society occupies Hamilton Hall at Columbia University 1969: Black Student Strike at the UW Madison 1969: Central State University students assemble in Columbus, Ohio, to oppose admissions policies 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 1970: Protests erupt following Kent State shootings 1970: Students protest racial injustice at Jackson State College 1985: Students camp out at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall to protest apartheid 1999: University of Minnesota students demand action regarding sexual conduct investigations 2014: Washington University students protest to draw attention to police abuse 2017: Emerson College students walk out to protest on-campus racism 2018: Student activists lead 'die-in' protesting gun violence at NYU A visual history of campus protests in the US 1970: GW University students carry on anti-war demonstrations near Watergate complex in DC 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "j_scott_applewhite@wcfcourier.com", "name": "J.

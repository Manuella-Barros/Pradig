Canada is not organic-averse either. While just looking at Saskatchewan figures, where there are no provincial organic regulations, one would assume organic is a venture from which farmers are deterred, as the provincial agricultural position in the organic space conceals the declining (but slowing) trend in certified farms. In reality, the number of organic acres across Canada has quadrupled since the turn of the century. In the last five years alone, the value of Canadian organic products has increased by 145%, which is used to suggest the high price organic products garner from the grocery store offsets the lower yield as a result of localized inputs. But it is not a stretch to suggest that the certification rigour may put farmers off from officially moving from a conventional to an organic operation.\n\nA very technical label\n\nThe underlying justification for an initial four-year and repeatedly detailed organic certification process is to assign authenticity and ensure traceability across the supply chain. Not only is the organic production stream heavily regulated in the field in terms of the processes and inputs that can be used, but every step along the manufacturing supply chain must also reliably follow organic limitations. As a result, regulatory officers must inspect sites for compliance every year following certification. The operating understanding of organic production boasts non-genetically modified seeds, physical considerations to prevent potential cross-contamination, and the use of pesticides as a last resort. However, farmers must ensure they have been following these regulations for at least three years before selling a product as organic.\n\nIn order for organic to be present anywhere on a Canadian label, certification and inspection are mandatory. That is part of the reason the phrase 'certified organic' is prohibited - because anything labelled organic inherently has been certified. The challenge then comes with multi-ingredient products, which have restrictions as to what can and cannot be classified as organic (Figure 1). If it is suspected that products claiming to be organic are not, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) may investigate, with subsequent punishments for offenders ranging in severity.\n\nChemical conundrum\n\nLevels of soil organic matter, a fundamental factor of agricultural productivity, can be improved with external inputs, like chemicals and fertilizer. In organic crop operations, however, it matters much more what those inputs are, and so the availability of approved chemicals is heavily regulated. For instance, pesticides may still be used in organic operations but must conform to a much stricter list of 'bio pesticides' - a term used to describe the type of pest intervention present. While chemical intervention is avoided, when possible, the prevalence of pesticide use undercuts the narrative that organic products are automatically pesticide-free.\n\nInvestigations completed in 2014 unearthed an industry conspiracy. The Canadian report revealed that 46% of organic produce is positive for chemical residue; a similar report out of the United States found 21% of organic samples positive for residues. The official response from the Canadian Organic Trade Association was that the high organic contribution is a direct effect of environmental contamination, further encouraging the narrative that organic products are safer for consumers than conventional products. While organic residue values in both surveys were dwarfed by conventional results, tests used to assess residues are typically ill-equipped to detect organic-approved pesticides. Further, the degree to how blatantly chemicals are sprayed is largely based on the income dependency of the country, rather than whether the farm is organic or conventional.\n\nThese results also called into question the general safety of agrochemicals. Although regulations and consequences to the contrary exist, consumers focused on the presence of residues in organic as opposed to the overall assurance that should come from CFIA inspections. Across food products, both imported and produced domestically, Canada has a 96.6% compliance rate, meaning nearly all available food falls at or below the maximum residue limits set by Health Canada. Maximum residue limits consider not only the quantity of chemicals used in production, but also how safe they are to handle, the product on which the substance was used, the consumption risk (to humans), and how easily the substance can be washed/removed from the product. It is the responsibility of the CFIA and Health Canada to ensure any substances involved in food production - in both organic and conventional streams - are safe for consumption, safe for the environment, and safely applied to fields.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nOne of the main reasons for limiting organic pesticide options is because of the uncertainty surrounding agrochemical use. The concern that the research on which approval is based does not adequately investigate human consequences is a major source of fear that should not be ignored by regulatory agencies, policymakers, or even producers. If consumer trust in chemical use can be enhanced, and if chemical research and development can meet the environmental concerns of organic producers, then organics and associated low yields may be advantaged by new (organic-appropriate) chemical options. However, for this to be a reality, the narrative surrounding organic pesticide-use needs to change, and production transparency, regardless of production ethos, needs to be improved.", "source": {"uri": "geneticliteracyproject.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Genetic Literacy Project"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_ladenheim@geneticliteracyproject.org", "name": "Andrew Ladenheim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organic food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organic farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Organic certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regenerative agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amino acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Traceability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatchewan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil organic matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Food_Inspection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Food Inspection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contamination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contamination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pest (organism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_Trade_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organic Trade Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable_Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable Agriculture", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Agrochemicals", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Organic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Organic", "wgt": 57}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Organization", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Organization", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Organic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Organic", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://geneticliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Spraying-pesticide.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511224", "eventUri": "eng-9511224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

That deep familiarity with organic carries over into a solid public trust. The USDA Organic seal is trusted by 70 percent of consumers - the most trusted of any agricultural label and the second-most trusted food label existing, second only to the American Heart Association's iconic checkmark.\n\n\"The results of our survey were incredibly encouraging,\" said Tom Chapman, co-CEO of OTA. \"As organic has become more accessible to consumers, the benefits of organic have become more widely known, boosting the trust in the organic seal. That's why our advocacy efforts to honor that trust and to ensure that organic standards keep evolving and strengthening are so critical.\"\n\nOTA partnered with Euromonitor International in a survey conducted in December of 2023 of around 1,200 consumers across the country to evaluate what today's consumers understand about organic, as well as their willingness to pay for USDA Organic products and the individual attributes supported by organic certification.\n\nA look at how organic stacked up against various claims and certifications was also done. The other food and beverage claims included in the survey were natural, local, grass-fed, raised without antibiotics, vegan, pesticide-free, free-range, hormone-free, humanely raised, allergen-free, fair trade, and regenerative.\n\nConsumers place a high value in organic\n\nOrganic products often command a price premium over non-organic. That's due to a variety of factors, including generally higher production costs for organic agriculture, including certification fees, higher processing costs, and limited federal support for organic agriculture and food production.\n\nToday's price-conscious shopper considers organic to be the food claim that most justify a higher price. When asked in the survey about the value of various claims, organic was ranked the most valuable, with nearly 60 percent of consumers saying that the organic claim warrants higher prices.\n\nThe OTA survey found that the more consumers know about organic, the more willing they are to pay the higher costs. Consumers who are unaware of organic's benefits often think that organic does not justify its higher prices; that changes dramatically when that consumer learns about some of the attributes of organic such as exclusions of GMOS, growth hormones, antibiotics and most pesticides. The justification to pay more for organic jumps by some 16 percentage points once the formerly unaware consumer is more knowledgeable about organic.\n\nFor more information:\n\nOrganic Trade Association\n\n444 N.

However, the market is plagued by issues of trust due to the actions of dishonest traders who mix organic with non-organic produce, selling them at premium prices without clear and specific criteria to verify the organic quality. This practice has led to consumer skepticism towards organic products, as highlighted by Nguyen Thu Ha, an owner of a farm in Cao Phong District, Hoa Binh Province, and Tran Thi Thu Huong, a long-time consumer of organic produce from Thu Duc City.\n\nThe lack of transparency has not only affected consumer trust but also posed challenges for genuine organic farmers. The situation is compounded by the existence of multiple certification bodies, both local and international, authorized by the state to certify organic products, as noted by Dr. Nguyen Duc Chinh of GenXanh farm in Hanoi's Phuc Tho District. This plethora of certification options has left producers and consumers confused about which certifications are credible.\n\nExperts argue that the definition and understanding of organic agricultural production need to be clarified to rebuild consumer confidence. The Vietnamese government, recognizing the potential of the organic agriculture market, has initiated measures to support organic farming. This includes the Organic Agriculture Development Project approved by the Prime Minister for the period 2020-2030, as mentioned by Nguyen Nhu Cuong, Director of the Department of Crop Production. Despite these efforts, challenges such as high input costs, decreased productivity, and the need for government support for organic farmers persist, as noted by representatives from the Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development in Lam Dong, Kon Tum, and Dak Lak provinces.\n\nTo further develop the organic agriculture sector, local and national government bodies are urged to provide more support to farmers and businesses involved in organic production. This includes financial support, promotional efforts to raise awareness among consumers and producers about the benefits of organic products, and the development of a robust market and distribution system for organic goods. The aim is to establish a transparent, trustworthy market for organic agriculture that benefits both consumers and producers, ensuring the long-term sustainability of Vietnam's agricultural sector.\n\nSource: en.sggp.org.vn\n\nPhoto source: Dreamstime.com", "source": {"uri": "freshplaza.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FreshPlaza"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organic farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Phong_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cao Phong district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H\u00f2a_B\u00ecnh_province", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th\u1ee7_\u0110\u1ee9c", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organic food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Vietnam", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110\u1eafk_L\u1eafk_province", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u0110\u1eafk L\u1eafk province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e2m_\u0110\u1ed3ng_province", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e2m \u0110\u1ed3ng province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kon_Tum", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kon Tum"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kon Tum"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable_Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable Agriculture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Organic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Organic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.freshplaza.com/remote/https/agfstorage.blob.core.windows.net/misc/FP_com/2024/04/15/ARem.jpg?preset=OgImage", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511224", "eventUri": "eng-9511224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Organic farming uses natural substances and processes to produce food and brings environmental, economic and social benefits.\n\nTo support European green ambitions, the European Commission launched the Farm to Fork Strategy in 2020. One of its aims is to bolster organic food sales and production with a focus on a fair and sustainable supply chain. This initiative was reinforced through the Organic Action Plan which seeks to achieve 25% of organic agricultural land by 2030. However, currently, only 10% of EU agricultural land is organic.\n\nOrganic farming is more labour-intensive and produces lower yields than conventional farmers, while generating similar income. Despite receiving economic support through the CAP, organic farmers feel they remain inadequately remunerated because their selling prices are lower than the retail prices.\n\nWhile the EU seeks to boost organic farming and food supply, some stakeholders argue that the EU needs a more robust implementation to transition towards fair and organic food systems. Others believe that the text on new genomic technologies (NGTs) approved by the European Parliament could help reach the target on organic agricultural lands.\n\nJoin this Euractiv Virtual Conference to discuss the sustainability of organic farming and its implications for reaching European green ambitions. Questions to be addressed include:\n\n- How can the EU strengthen the position of organic farmers in the supply chain?\n\n- How can the gap between organic produce selling prices and retail prices be addressed?\n\n- How compatible are the NGTs and organic farming in light of the target for agricultural lands set by the European Commission?\n\n- What steps are needed to further develop organic food supply and demand?", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organic farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Green_Deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Green Deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organic food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common Agricultural Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euractiv", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euractiv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable_Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Sustainable Agriculture", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/eaAgriFood_Twitter_Chat_29_November_20233.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511224", "eventUri": "eng-9511224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The ship has sailed.\" That was 14 years ago. Since then, algorithms have been altered. Weird Twitter came and went. Influencers say they find it all but impossible to get in front of their own Instagram followers. But Vaynerchuk, despite having founded a successful paid social media agency, argued that organic social should be \"the starting point for marketing\" to Possible conference attendees in Miami last week.\n\n\"It's a major issue. Shit, it's 2024. It's time to finally take some of this stuff seriously,\" he said. \"Organic social is the starting point for marketing, and at this conference, it's the 20th most important thing to brands.\"\n\nVaynerchuk might be right -- organic social is far down the priority list for most chief marketers. But when publishers and influencers producing original content can't get a look-in using organic social and when TikTok, one of the last platforms marketers credit any organic success to, is set to be banned in the U.S., what hope does a retailer or consumer packaged goods brand have? Digiday has delved into the debate, weighing the arguments for and against marketers relying on organic social.\n\nThe days when brand marketers could reach massive audiences with low-effort social posts \"are well and truly over,\" said Gareth Harrison, a strategist at U.K. social agency SocialChain.\n\nThe engagement well has been drunk dry, Harrison argued. When other brands began using the same friendly tone as PaddyPower or RyanAir, he argued, it eroded the distinction between them. \"Their voice is being drowned out by the sound of other brands copying that style of messaging,\" he added.\n\nCallum McMahon, executive strategy director at Born Social, said the agency stopped recommending marketers focus on organic social almost five years ago. \"If you're looking at social, just focus on paid because that's the only way you can guarantee any results,\" he recalled advising clients.\n\nTom Sneddon, co-founder and managing director of social agency Supernova, said that organic is at best, a single tool in the marketing shed. \"I've never built a brand exclusively off organic. It's a weapon at our disposal; you have to pull a few different levers. Anyone who claims they do is telling you only half the story,\" he said.\n\nRyanair's self-aware TikToks might help it recover goodwill among European holidaymakers, but it won't help it out-compete rival budget airlines.\n\n\"Organic social is massively misunderstood. It was never built for scale and it was never built for assuming social was free,\" added Sneddon. \"You are not going to get in front of the people you need to get in front of quickly by doing it organically.\"\n\nIn truth, the case for organic social is really a case for word-of-mouth recommendation and for targeting specific online communities. Social platforms that emphasize community engagement, such as Reddit, still encourage brands to use the organic route to reach consumers; the platform released free organic marketing tools just a few months ago.\n\nFor Sneddon, \"word-of-mouth remains the single biggest motivator for brand trust. That is really hard to scale with reach... [but] it's really easy to scale with engagement.\" Even today, he argued, that is still possible for a brand that has chosen its time and place well. \"If you can find a community, a location, a passion point and build positive sentiment around it through highly engaged, highly targeted, highly memorable moments I can absolutely prove to you the value of organic social,\" he said.\n\nDuring last week's London Marathon, for example, Supernova client Back Market -- an e-commerce retailer specializing in refurbished tech -- used its social presence to pluck out examples of runners crediting their race success to refurbed tech products. \"It's less about selling and actually about presenting the benefits and the values,\" said Sneddon.\n\nStephanie Schafer, president and chief growth officer at Minnesota agency The Social Lights argued in favor of keeping organic social as an experimental channel. From a reach perspective, she conceded, \"Organic doesn't make as much sense as it used to. However, it's a great test and learn.\"\n\nMarketers can try out new types of content or messaging without having to risk significant media spend, she said. \"That's a huge benefit of continuing an organic strategy in addition to having paid support.\"\n\nFor McMahon, TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels have changed the advice Born Social has been dishing out. The former is now a \"mainstay\" of organic social client plans, he said.\n\nIn response to client demand, the agency launched a newsroom service producing reactive short-form video on behalf of brands. \"Earned reach is now a thing again on social,\" he added. That said, it's not the only pillar. McMahon said he recommends clients pursue organic but use paid social to boost high-performing creative, alongside creator partnerships in service of \"one cohesive story... one clear strategy you're taking to consumers.\"", "source": {"uri": "digiday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digiday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organic food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Vaynerchuk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Vaynerchuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_W._Sneddon_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas W.

{"id": 223708914, "title": "How Hadrian\u2019s Wall is revealing a hidden side of Roman history", "text": "A party invitation. A broken flipflop. A wig. Letters of complaint about road conditions, and an urgent request for more beer. It sounds like the aftermath of a successful spring break, but these items are nearly 2,000 years old. They\u2019re just some of the finds from Hadrian\u2019s Wall \u2013 the 73-mile stone wall built as the northwestern boundary of the Roman Empire, sealing off Britannia (modern-day England and Wales) from Caledonia (essentially today\u2019s Scotland). While most of us think of Pompeii and Herculaneum if we\u2019re thinking of everyday objects preserved from ancient Rome, this outpost in the wild north of the empire is home to some of the most extraordinary finds. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dramatic stamp on the countryside \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more redolent of saying you\u2019re entering the Roman empire than seeing that structure,\u201d says Richard Abdy, lead curator of the British Museum\u2019s current exhibition, Legion, which spotlights the everyday life of Roman soldiers, showcasing many finds from Hadrian\u2019s Wall in the process. A tenth of the Roman army was based in Britain, and that makes the wall a great source of military material, he says. But it\u2019s not all about the soldiers, as excavations are showing. A multicultural melting pot Hadrian, who ordered the wall to be built in 122CE after a visit to Britannia, had a different vision of empire than his predecessors, says Frances McIntosh, curator for English Heritage\u2019s 34 sites along Hadrian\u2019s Wall. \u201cAll the emperors before him were about expanding the empire, but Hadrian was known as the consolidator,\u201d she says. He relinquished some of the territory acquired by his predecessor Trajan, and \u201cdecided to set the borders\u201d \u2013 literally, in some cases, with wooden poles at sites in Germany, or with stone in Britannia. Where those poles rotted thousands of years ago, the wall is still standing: \u201cA great visual reminder\u201d of the Roman empire, says McIntosh. It\u2019s not just a wall. There\u2019s a castle every mile along, and turrets at every third-of-a-mile point, with ditches and banks both north and south. \u201cYou can imagine the kind of impact that would have had, not just on the landscape but on the people living in the area,\u201d says McIntosh. And thanks to the finds from the wall, we know a surprising amount about those people. Although historians have long thought of army outposts as remote, male-dominant places, the excavations along the wall show that\u2019s not the case. Not only were soldiers accompanied by their families, but civilians would settle around the settlements to do business. \u201c You can almost see Housesteads as a garrison town,\u201d says McIntosh. \u201cThere were places you could go for a drink and so on.\u201d The Roman rule of thumb was not to post soldiers in the place they came from, because of the risk of rebellion. That meant Hadrian\u2019s Wall was a cultural melting point, with cohorts from modern-day Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Algeria, Iraq, Syria \u2013 and more. \u201cIt was possibly more multicultural because it was a focus point,\u201d says McIntosh, who says that the surrounding community might have included traders from across the empire. Soldiers were split into two groups. Legionaries were Roman citizens from Italy, who had more rights than other soldiers and imported olive oil, wine and garum (a sauce made from decomposing fish). They worked alongside auxiliaries \u2013 soldiers from conquered provinces, who had fewer rights, but could usually acquire citizenship after 25 years of service. Soldiers carved their names and regiments on stones to show which part of the wall they built \u2013 around 50 of them are on display at Chesters fort. But the wall shows that women and children were equally present. McIntosh says that pottery brought to the camps \u2013 from the Low Countries and North Africa \u2013 shows that the soldiers \u201cbrought their families, who cooked in traditional style.\u201d Archaeologists have found what seems to be an ancient tagine for North African-style cooking. A tombstone from Arbeia fort for a woman named Regina shows she was a freed slave from southern Britain who was bought by \u2013 and married to \u2013 a Syrian soldier. Another woman buried at Birdoswald fort was laid to rest with chainmail that appears to be from modern-day Poland. \u201cPerhaps she married someone in the army,\u201d says McIntosh, who calls the wall a \u201cmelting pot of people from all over the world under the banner of the army.\u201d \u201cThey brought their own religions, as well as worshipping Roman gods and adopting local deities,\u201d she adds. At Carrawburgh, a temple to Mithras \u2013 an originally Persian deity \u2013 sat near a spring with a shrine to a local water spirit. \u2018Wretched little Brits\u2019 Some of the most extraordinary finds from the Roman empire are coming from one site on Hadrian\u2019s Wall: Vindolanda. Here, archaeologists have found a wealth of organic remains because of what curator Barbara Birley calls the \u201cunusual conditions onsite.\u201d At Vindolanda there are the remains of at least nine forts over 14 levels. \u201cWhen the Romans would leave, they would knock down timber forts, and cover the area with turf and clay, sealing the layers underneath,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it happened so many times, the bottom five or six layers are sealed in anaerobic conditions, so things don\u2019t decay. When we get down there, we get wooden objects, textiles, anything organic.\u201d Vindolanda has the largest collection of Roman textiles from a single site in western Europe, as well as the largest leather collection of any site in the Roman empire \u2013 including 5,000 shoes, and even a broken leather flip-flop. \u201cWe probably had a population of 3,000 to 6,000 depending on the period, so 5,000 is a lot,\u201d says Birley. For Abdy, the shoes evoke the conditions of the wet borderlands. \u201cWomen\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes are hobnailed \u2013 you needed it in the mucky frontier dirt tracks. They\u2019re very evocative.\u201d There\u2019s even a wig made from a local plant, hair moss, which is said to repel midges \u2013 the scourge of Scotland during the summer. A centurion\u2019s helmet is also crested with hairmoss \u2013 the ancient equivalent of spraying yourself with insect repellent. The first woman to write in Latin One of the most famous finds is the trove of wooden writing tablets \u2013 the largest found anywhere. \u201cThey give a snapshot of what life was actually like,\u201d says Birley. \u201cWe understand so much more from written correspondence than from \u2018stuff,\u2019 and, archaeologically, it\u2019s the stuff that usually survives \u2013 things like metals and ceramics. \u201cThese were written in ink, not on a wax stylus tablet, and we believe they were used for what we\u2019d put in emails: \u2018The roads are awful,\u2019 \u2018The soldiers need more beer.\u2019 Everyday business.\u201d The tablets \u2013 or \u201cpersonal letters\u201d as Birley describes them \u2013 were found on the site of a bonfire when the ninth cohort of Batavians (in the modern-day Netherlands) were told to move on. \u201cThey had a huge bonfire and lots of letters were chucked in the fire. Some have been singed \u2013 we think it may have rained,\u201d she says. One of them calls the locals \u201cBritunculi\u201d \u2013 \u201cwretched little Brits.\u201d Another talks about an outbreak of pinkeye. One claims that the roads are too bad to send wagons; another laments that the soldiers have run out of beer. Among the 1,700 letters are 20 that mention a woman called Sulpicia Lepidina. She was the wife of the commander of the garrison, and seems to have played a crucial role. There\u2019s a letter to her from another woman, Paterna, agreeing to send her two medicines, one a fever cure. Birley says it\u2019s similar to today. \u201cIf you\u2019re a group of moms, still today we say, \u2018Do you have the Calpol?\u2019 It\u2019s very human.\u201d For Abdy, it\u2019s a sign that women were traders. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly flogging her medicines,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really great stuff.\u201d Another tablet is an invite from Claudia Severa, the wife of another commander at a nearby camp. It\u2019s an invitation to a birthday party. Under the formal invitation, presumably written by a scribe, is a scrawl in another hand: \u201cI shall expect you, sister. Farewell, sister, my dearest soul.\u201d Presumably written by Claudia herself, it is thought to be the earliest example of a woman\u2019s handwriting in Latin. Without the organic finds \u2013 the shoes and the letters that indisputably belonged to women, unlike jewellery or weaving equipment \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to prove conclusively that women lived in significant numbers. Vindolanda \u201cillustrate the missing gaps,\u201d says Abdy. For Birley, they prove that women were as crucial a part of army communities as men. \u201cBefore the Lepidina tablets were found we didn\u2019t really understand the interactions between the soldiers and their wives,\u201d she says. Another tablet is written by what is thought to be a Spanish standard-bearer\u2019s common-law wife, ordering military equipment for her partner. \u201cThe Vindolanda collection is showing that there weren\u2019t just camp followers and prostitutes; women were part of everyday life, and contributing to the military community in many ways,\u201d says Birley. Abdy says that Hadrian\u2019s Wall is interesting because the resident women span \u201call classes of society,\u201d from Regina \u2013 the dead freedwoman, who would have been \u201cbottom of the heap\u201d \u2013 to the trader Paterna and the noblewoman Lepidina. And of course, there\u2019s the wall itself. \u201cIn the Netherlands and Germany the finds are often stunning and better preserved \u2013 you go to museums and are bowled over. But in terms of structural remains, Hadrian\u2019s Wall must be among the best,\u201d says McIntosh, modestly, of her site. Abdy agrees: \u201cI can\u2019t think of many symbols so redolent of imperial will than that wall.\u201d For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/hadrian-wall-revealing-hidden-side-070015827.html", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/7792e0e292f47d5dcd53066673ea6587", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:00:39", "author": "Julia Buckley", "authors": ["Julia Buckley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.352}

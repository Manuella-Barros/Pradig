{"id": 239757628, "title": "Yankees' Aaron Judge to Skip 2024 MLB HR Derby: 'I'll Be There' When It's Back in NY", "text": "Aaron Judge said he will pass on the 2024 Home Run Derby, citing that \"there's no need this year,'' per the New York Post's Dan Martin. Judge, who won the event in 2017, said that his days participating in the Home Run Derby aren't over, but he'd rather wait until it's in New York again. \"I'm not done with it,'' Judge said. \"Once it's back in New York, I'll be there.\" Judge has not competed since his rookie year and will once again forgo the Home Run Derby despite being asked to compete. He will likely still be at Globe Life Field in Texas for the All-Star Game, which takes place on July 16. Judge currently leads the majors in home runs with 28, collecting his most recent in the first inning against the Atlanta Braves on Saturday. It will certainly be a disappointment for some fans to not see Judge competing, but Yankees fans have to feel a sense of pride that he'd rather hit long balls in front of a home crowd. In 2017, Judge blasted 47 total home runs across three rounds, and he needed just about half of his allotted time to defeat Miguel San\u00f3 in the final round with 11 home runs. He also had four homers longer than 500 feet, with his longest going 513 feet. As impressive as that performance was, fans will have to wait a few years to see him replicate it, as the Home Run Derby won't be in New York for at least two more years. The 2025 All-Star Weekend will take place at Truist Park in Atlanta before traveling to Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia in 2026. Perhaps Judge's decision to sit out of the event until it's in New York will influence MLB to let the Yankees host in 2027. While Judge won't be hoisting a Home Run Derby trophy this season, he'll be looking to be crowned a champion in another way. The Yankees sit at the top of the AL East at 51-27 so far this year, and they're looking to put together a strong postseason performance to win their first World Series since 2009.", "summary": "Aaron Judge said he will pass on the 2024 Home Run Derby, citing that \"there's no need this year,'' per the New York Post's Dan Martin.

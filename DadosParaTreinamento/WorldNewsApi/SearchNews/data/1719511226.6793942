Security guard trying to stop Sky Sports' Martin Brundle...", "text": "French footballer Kylian Mbappe has become the latest star to get the Martin Brundle treatment - as his security guard was given a ticking-off at the Monaco Grand Prix. Sky Sports pundit Brundle - renowned for ambushing celebrity guests at Formula One races - persisted in questioning the Real Madrid-bound striker at today's event. And not even attempts to fend him off by a security official could stop former F1 driver Brundle, who insisted on camera: 'It's all right, mate - I'm in charge here.' Brundle did manage to get some words from Mbappe, having previously been given the silent treatment by some celebrities evidently unhappy about his attentions. Among those frustrated by being 'Brundled' in his famous 'Grid Walks' have been British model Cara Delevingne and US rapper Machine Gun Kelly. Mbappe, who has announced he is leaving French champions Paris St Germain this summer, seemed briefly more agreeable after Brundle got to this morning. But at first an official with a 'VIP' lanyard around his neck had attempted to intervene between the pair when the interviewer approached - only for Brundle to tell him: 'It's all right, mate - I'm in charge here.' The Sky Sports presenter then addressed 25-year-old World Cup winner Mbappe, saying: 'How are you doing? I think he's happy to talk, really - Kylian, are you up for a quick word with Sky?' After Mbappe replied, 'I'm just here for the race', Brundle continued: 'I think you're fast enough to beat these cars to the first corner.' Mbappe smiled as he answered: 'No, no, I'm not faster than the cars. 'I just want to be here like a fan and enjoy the moment.' Brundle signed off the interview with a sardonic reference to the security guard, telling Mbappe: 'I'll let you get on and enjoy the moment. Thanks for talking to us - and your dear friend there.' Viewers posting on X, formerly Twitter, after the exchange was shared by Sky Sports appeared largely in favour of Brundle's approach - with some questioning why Mbappe was in the VIP section if wanting to be there 'like a fan'. Some suggested Brundle made them cringe - but most seemed entertained, with comments such as 'Best one yet', 'Love him' and 'legend'. One poster wrote: 'Sometimes I think the gimmick of the grid walk has worn off then Martin Brundle delivers something like this.' Others remarked, 'You tell em Martin', 'Good on you' and 'No one stops Brundle'. And there was also the comment: 'A true legend of the game. And Kylian Mbappe.' Another poster complained of Mbappe: '\"I want to be here like a fan\" as he walks down the grid just before the race with a VIP pass and 4 security guards.' Other celebrities who have been attending today's Monaco Grand Prix - seen as the most prestigious on the F1 circuit - have included models Heidi Klum and Emily Ratajkowski, Manchester United and England footballer Mason Mount and Hollywood actor Michael Douglas. Broadcaster Brundle, 64, started at Sky Sports in 2012 - and has frequently hit the headlines with tense and awkward celebrity exchanges in racetrack VIP areas. He was snubbed when trying to interview model Delevingne, 31, live on camera ahead of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in July last year. In his interview with Delevingne in July, the model left Brundle high and dry on the grid at the British Grand Prix, after snubbing his request for a chat live on camera. With the Red Arrows roaring above, Brundle spotted her nearby but was swiftly told by an apparent security aide that 'she doesn't want to talk'. The broadcaster responded by insisting: 'That's the deal now, everybody talks on the grid.' Delevingne was seen to grimace as he moved closer and asked her: 'Can we have a quick chat at Sky F1? Good to see you on the grid.' After she twice said 'no', Brundle told her: 'The deal is everybody has to speak on the grid.' But after she looked away, insisting 'I can't hear anything, sorry', he sarcastically rounded things up by saying: 'Okay, well, I'm sure it would have been extremely interesting.' She then gave a thumbs-up for the camera and later that day Delevingne took to X to offer a further response to the interaction. She reposted a tweet which read: 'At this point, Martin Brundle is just doing it to manufacture the moment for the controversy of it all. 'You can clearly see the PR rep tell him \"no\" and shake his head when he goes up towards Cara Delevingne. 'He had an out and he chose not to take it to make a statement.' Cara replied: 'I was told to say no so I did. Thank you for seeing both sides xxx.' Another awkward exchange came at the Brazilian Grand Prix last November, when Machine Gun Kelly - real name Colson Baker - struggled to get with Brundle. Their two-minute conversation was filled with awkward pauses, in what viewers later dubbed 'the most awkward interview ever' - with matters not helped with the US star, 33, tried to initiate a live 'air guitar and piano' session with his interviewer. The first hints of awkwardness came when he reached over to fiddle with the broadcaster's pin, with Brundle explaining: 'That's a poppy.' They soon hit another hurdle when Brundle asked: 'What's going on with your career at the moment?' Machine Gun Kelly responded with: 'My career - I don't think about my career. I don't think about it.' Clearly stumped, Brundle responded: 'Well, good luck with it, whatever you do.' Machine Gun Kelly later responded to a backlash from viewers by posting on X: 'My vibe is \"the worst\" how? because someone put a microphone in my face essentially forcing me to do a random interview when I was just trying to enjoy an event? 'Because car engines were so loud I couldn't hear him? please tell me more about why I'm the worst.' In a separate tweet, he added: 'My anxiety has won. I hate being in public.' Today's clash with Mbappe's protector was not Brundle's first brush with security guards. Another US rapper Megan Thee Stallion seemed happy enough to engage at the 2021 United States Grand Prix, waving at the presenter. But two crew members, with at least one being part of her security detail, made it difficult for Brundle to get an interview. Amasked bodyguard first held him off with an arm and shook his head as Brundle introduced himself while the singer smiled. Brundle told the bodyguard, 'Okay, boss, before directing his attention back to Megan - saying: 'You're a freestyle rapper; have you got any rap for us today on Formula 1?' She laughed and responded: 'I have no rap today, sorry.' As he asked the multi-Grammy Award winner who she would be supporting in the race, another man put his body between the journalist and the star. He pushed Brundle away and told him he could not speak with her, only for the presenter to hit back: 'I can do that, because I did.", "summary": "Sky Sports pundit Brundle - renowned for ambushing celebrity guests at Formula One races - persisted in questioning the Real Madrid-bound striker at today's event.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13461525/Kylian-Mbappe-Sky-Sports-Martin-Brundle-football-Monaco.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/15/85353223-0-image-m-51_1716735538581.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:05:39", "author": "Aidan Radnedge,Editor", "authors": ["Aidan Radnedge", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.099}

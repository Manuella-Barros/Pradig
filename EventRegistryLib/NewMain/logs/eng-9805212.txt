He picked up the minor injury during joint practice with the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday. Because of the ankle ailment, Prescott won't play in Dallas' preseason opener.\n\nStill, it doesn't appear as if Dak Prescott is in danger of missing any time come regular season.

Thankfully, the Cowboys are progressing with franchise quarterback Dak Prescott, who wants a hefty pay raise from Dallas. Conversations with Prescott's agent on a new deal are ongoing. Though a deal is not considered close, the Cowboys believe they are in a better place than they were this offseason.\n\nPrescott is entering the final year of his contract, and whether the Cowboys will pay Prescott has been one of the most fascinating subplots of the NFL offseason. Prescott is adamant that he wants to be paid what he believes he's worth. Not just because Prescott wants generational wealth, mind you. Instead, he's paving the way for his teammates and other quarterbacks.\n\n\"I'm a guy that grew up with two older brothers,\" Prescott said. \"You understand what a brotherhood means, not only for just this team but the fraternity of the NFL and the players. The money is out there, and the money can happen. It can be done. There's ways to make everything work for both ways. In that sense, it's always about pushing the envelope for the next man.\"\n\nWhile the talks between Prescott's representatives are ongoing, Dallas's situation is at least improving. While things might not be in the same spot in talks with star wideout CeeDee Lamb's pending extension, the Cowboys considers itself further along on a new deal with Lamb than with Prescott.\n\nWill the Cowboys figure things out with Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb?\n\nA cloud will hang over training camp until Dallas figures out how to sign Prescott and Lamb to long-term deals. While some progress with both players is still progress, it might not be enough with the Cowboys facing such an important season.\n\nDallas needs both of its stars this season and in the future, especially with Prescott appearing open to free agency. If that were to happen, a team like the Pittsburgh Steelers, experiencing a quarterback audition, could sign Prescott.\n\nThe Cowboys cannot afford to lose Prescott in free agency. They have one of the NFL's more complete rosters, and Prescott is the centerpiece of their offense.

CeeDee Lamb has had enough of Jerry Jones: He no longer feels part of the Dallas Cowboys\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys made the decision to give quarterback Dak Prescott a day off from Friday's practice, citing minor ankle soreness as the reason. The team assured fans that this was purely a precautionary measure, with no serious injury concerns on the horizon. Prescott's ankle has been a point of attention ever since he fractured it a few years ago.\n\nEarlier this offseason, he was seen wearing a walking boot on that same ankle, raising some eyebrows. However, Prescott was quick to dismiss any worries, telling Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that it was \"absolutely nothing\" to be concerned about. He also confirmed that he is no longer wearing the boot, further easing concerns.\n\nFriday's practice was a light one, coming on the heels of joint sessions with the Los Angeles Rams, as the Cowboys prepare for their preseason game on Sunday. With Prescott sitting out, backup quarterbacks Cooper Rush and Trey Lance took the snaps during practice. Even if Prescott had been on the field, it's likely that Rush and Lance would have seen more action, as Prescott isn't expected to play in the upcoming preseason game.\n\nThe decision to rest Prescott is a standard move at this stage of training camp, where the focus is on keeping key players healthy for the regular season. The Cowboys are clearly taking a cautious approach with their star quarterback, who is essential to their Super Bowl ambitions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys' training camp has been eventful for reasons beyond Prescott's minor injury. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, another cornerstone of the Cowboys' offense, has been absent from camp as he negotiates a new contract.\n\nLamb's absence has been notable, with both fans and the organization eagerly anticipating his return to the field. The young receiver's contract situation has been a major storyline, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the team's preseason activities.\n\nAs the Cowboys gear up for the 2024 season, the health and readiness of Dak Prescott, coupled with the resolution of CeeDee Lamb's contract, will be critical. The team's success this year hinges on these two key players being fully engaged and ready to contribute. Fans will be watching closely, hoping for positive outcomes on both fronts as the regular season approaches.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Rush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/70802df2fd97b63d3c9439db140261e3/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/08/09/17232340922184.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805212", "eventUri": "eng-9805212", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The same cannot be said for star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, who is also in the final year of his contract and hinted at frustration with the Cowboys via social media on Thursday night.\n\nFans in Dallas are likely concerned about both Prescott's contract and his ankle. Prescott underwent surgery to repair a compound fracture dislocation of his right ankle in 2020. The injury forced him to miss the final 11 games of the 2020 season. He was spotted in a walking boot last month, and some found his explanation for that to be worrisome.\n\nPrescott passed for 4,516 yards and a league-high 36 touchdowns last year while leading Dallas to a 12-5 record in the regular season.

Sports Illustrated's Mike Fisher reported that if Prescott continues to wait, his average annual salary for his next deal could reach $70 million.\n\n\"So, after a recent QB deal averaging $53 million annually (Jared Goff), Dak might settle in at $54 million? No, wait. What about the recent $55 million deal (Joe Burrow)? No, wait. What about the many hints that we're talking about $60 million?\" Fisher wrote in an August 8, 2024, story titled, \"Source: 'Patient' Cowboys QB Dak Prescott Can Sign $70 Million Per Year Contract.\"\n\n\"No, wait. On the way to Dak seeking a 'highest-paid-player-ever' offer, one NFL source tells CowboysCountry.com that with 'patience,' Prescott's value will hit $70 million annually.\"\n\nFor context, Prescott has an average annual salary of $40 million in his current four-year, $160 million contract. If Prescott reaches $70 million annually on his next deal, it would be close to double the rate of his current contract.\n\nThe Cowboys were not done any favors by the recents deals for Jared Goff and Trevor Lawrence. ESPN's Adam Schefter previously reported that Prescott would land a salary of at least $60 million.\n\nSpotrac projects Prescott's market value to be a four-year, $220 million contract. This would give Prescott an average annual salary of $55.1 million. Prescott's latest comments serve as the backdrop for all this chatter as the quarterback left the door open to playing elsewhere.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's a business. I'm going to say it. I want to be here, but when you look up, all the great quarterbacks I watch played for other teams,\" Prescott explained to reporters on July 26.\n\n\"So, my point in saying that is that that's not something to fear. That may be a reality for me one day. May not be my decision, so that's the the freedom that I have.\"\n\nPrescott firmly controls his future thanks to a no-franchise tag clause in his current deal. The quarterback could opt to play out the final year of his deal and become a free agent in 2025.\n\nFisher also reported that Prescott may seeking to be the \"highest-paid player in the history of the NFL.\" This would make it challenging to re-sign other players like CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons while fielding a competitive roster.\n\n\"If the Cowboys QB isn't really serious about negotiating now because he wants to wait ... and wait ... and wait ... while seeking to be the highest-paid player in the history of the NFL? That's a problem. So. ... $70 million APY?\" Fisher added.\n\n\"That would blow away the five-year contract worth $275 million that averages $55 million APY that Burrow has in Cincy - and it is certainly Prescott's right to seek that ... now, from the Cowboys' Jerry Jones ...Or next spring, from the Cowboys or any other highest bidder.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_adams@heavy.com", "name": "Jonathan Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1740000904-e1723205983721.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805212", "eventUri": "eng-9805212", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1877, "textEnd": 1884}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

He threw 36 touchdown passes and just nine interceptions while racking up 4,516 yards through the air, his third season with over 4,000 passing yards. His 410 completions tied a career-high and were the most in the NFL.\n\nPrescott isn't the only notable star player from Dallas's offense that wasn't present on Friday. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb was also absent as he continues to angle for a contract extension from the Cowboys. Lamb's contract saga became spotlighted further after a comment he made on social media Thursday night in response to comments made by Jerry Jones.\n\nPrescott voiced his support for Lamb to receive a new deal when speaking to reporters after Thursday's practice. Prescott is also in the market for a contract extension himself, with free agency looming after the 2024 season, so he's certainly eager to see his teammate get paid.\n\nDallas plays its first preseason game on Sunday, Aug. 11 against the Los Angeles Rams. The starters likely won't be on the field much, if at all.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Cowboys Say Dak Prescott 'Will Be Fine' After Missing Practice With Ankle Soreness.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karl_rasmussen@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Karl Rasmussen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/eoxp2q/picture290926099/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/28a60281-32ad-40be-92ff-6bea8e87924b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805212", "eventUri": "eng-9805212", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 1397, "textEnd": 1404}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The Dallas Cowboys are among those teams.\n\nThat's why Thursday's joint practice that involved the Cowboys hosting the Los Angeles Rams was so critical: it was the first and last action against another team that many of Dallas' starters will face this offseason before kicking off the 2024 NFL season at the Cleveland Browns in a month. Given the joint practice's importance, here are nine observations with thoughts from both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. Enjoy.\n\nOffenseDak Prescott looks ready for Week 1 Dak Prescott DAL * QB * #4 CMP%69.5YDs4516TD36INT9YD/Att7.65 View Profile\n\nDak Prescott has never played in a preseason with Mike McCarthy as his head coach, which has been since 2020. The last time he did suit up in an exhibition game was in 2019, the last year of Jason Garrett's tenure. That meant Thursday's joint practice against the Rams was Prescott's last time facing competition outside of his teammates in practice for the next month's opener.\n\nPrescott routinely zipped balls past the ear holes of Los Angeles defenders and into the arms of his intended targets all afternoon long, indicating he is ready to play ball for real. The 2023 NFL MVP runner-up said as much after practice.\n\n\"I'm going into Year 9 and I've had a lot of experience,\" Prescott said. \"I think that carries into my confidence to say I could play a game right now. A part of me wishes that (scrimmage against the Rams) was a game, I wish it was, that those third and fourth downs were real. To see the defense come on and to see the whole chess match, I'm looking forward to feeling that and getting into that rhythm, but the team will get to that and everything we need in the preseason to make sure that we're ready to roll when it's time to roll. Me, personally, I'm ready to play and get out there.\"\n\nThe month off for Prescott doesn't provide cause for concern for Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones, who, obviously, wants to keep his quarterback upright for the months ahead. Some teams play their starters for a few drives in the preseason. Not Dallas.\n\n\"I didn't think about him not having competition to work against for the next four or five weeks. I don't think he needs that for the price you pay for exposure (to a potential injury),\" Jones said Thursday. \"I'm really proud that our other quarterbacks (Trey Lance and Cooper Rush) are going to get that exposure. So that's a plus. Dak has been just outstanding in my eyes, so far in this camp.\"\n\nMcCarthy concurred.\n\n\"I think Dak is having an excellent camp,\" McCarthy said before the joint practice.\n\nPrescott believes he is playing better now than he did in 2023 when he led the NFL in passing touchdowns (36), which helped him earn NFL MVP runner-up and second-Team All-Pro honors. The reason why is because he is in his second season of the Cowboys offense with McCarthy calling the plays.\n\n\"Everywhere,\" Prescott said when asked where he has improved as a quarterback from last year to now. \"I think for one experience helps. So just seeing things, recognizing things a whole lot faster. It's just a credit to the experience and then my footwork, accuracy, all of that's just the time that I put into it in the offseason. I take pride in how hard I work, and how diligent I am in my work. I expect to make those plays, I expect to get better. ... I think that's a credit to McCarthy and this offense as well. ... Being tied to my footwork, and those guys (younger receivers and tight ends) accepting the challenge and saying, 'Hey, I don't care if I'm young or not, I can make a play, and watch this.' They've been doing that, and it's been very, very impressive.\"\n\nEzekiel Elliott still has some juice left Ezekiel Elliott DAL * RB * #15 Att184Yds642TD3FL1 View Profile\n\nCowboys three-time Pro Bowl running back Ezekiel Elliott said he takes the most pride in still being in the NFL entering his ninth season in 2024, but Thursday against the Rams, he looked more than just happy to be here.\n\n\"I've seen juice in his legs,\" Jones said Thursday when talking about Elliott's joint practice production. \"When one of y'all figure out how to determine whether or not he's still got it or not with what we're doing out here at practice, tell me about it. Ok. That's hard to ascertain. I liked what I've seen from Zeke. By the way, no surprise at all, Zeke is an outstanding practice player, and he's outstanding. Prepared when he does get into competition. I don't think there's anybody in the sports world that doesn't know that he'll compete when the kickoff of the first real games happen.\"\n\nDallas believes that despite Elliott's rushing yards per carry and rushing yards per game figures declining over the years, he brings an element to its ground game that it missed without him in 2023 when it had Tony Pollard and Rico Dowdle as its top two running backs. Dowdle once again will be one of Dallas' top two backs along with Zeke in 2024.\n\n\"I thought we were missing physicalness in our run game,\" Jones said. \"Now, Rico is a physical runner, but we didn't have his availability all the time. Zeke gives us a punishing runner, that does take its toll. We've had a lot of success with him as our running back. That gives you a pretty good base of being happy he's back here.\"\n\nWR Brandin Cooks is WR1 in CeeDee Lamb's absence Brandin Cooks DAL * WR * #3 TAR81REC54REC YDs657REC TD8FL0 View Profile\n\nA lot of ink gets spilled about wide receiver Brandin Cooks, who is entering his 11th NFL season in 2024 and turning 31 years old on Sept. 25, being a mentor to younger receivers. However, he was quick to remind everyone Thursday, including one of his former teams in the Rams, why he is angling to become the first player in NFL history to record a 1,000-yard receiving season for five different teams in 2024. Prescott trusts him thoroughly.\n\n\"He's a professional, probably the most professional teammate I've ever been around and one of the best men I've ever been around,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"That carries over into how he prepares, how he communicates and how he practices, which obviously helps with our connection. I knew that he wanted to come out here and have a great day obviously against a team that he was once on, and he did exactly that.\n\n\"So he is still a big-time receiver, can be a No. 1 receiver, whatever you wanna call it. He's very valuable to me,\" Prescott continued. \"He's very valuable to this offense and I think today was just another glimpse of it. For our connection, he'll only get better. He's a guy that I spent time with on and off the field, and that connection will just continue to grow.\"\n\nTE Jake Ferguson could have another breakout in 2024 Jake Ferguson DAL * TE * #87 TAR102REC71REC YDs761REC TD5FL0 View Profile\n\nTight end Jake Ferguson, a 2022 fourth-round pick out of Wisconsin, earned his first Pro Bowl nod in 2023 after hauling in 71 catches for 761 receiving yards and five touchdowns. Those numbers could double in 2024 with how much Prescott loves throwing to him over the middle. Prescott targeted him over a handful of times in 11-on-11 drill work against the Rams on Thursday.\n\n\"Honestly, there's not a ceiling for that guy,\" Prescott said on Aug. 2. \"I feel like I keep saying it, and it's good that I keep saying it because that's the type of people we have: another guy that loves the game, that takes this job very serious, has a passion for it. His intensity, you saw it last year in plenty of games. Just his aggressiveness and the mindset that he has to have, especially at that position. You're asked to block some of the best athletes in our game, and then go run routes on safeties, linebackers and cornerbacks, and you're expected to win.\"\n\nSeeing the way he attacks off the line of scrimmage as a blocker in the run game the same way he does as a receiver in the passing game fires Prescott up.\n\n\"That's a guy that has that mindset to do exactly that. Whether it's blocking Micah Parsons, D-Law or another great end on another time,\" Prescott said. Or it's running a route against (DaRon) Bland, Donovan Wilson or a DB from somebody in the division. He expects to win every single time. As long as he has that mindset and continues to grow and communicate, there is no ceiling for that guy. Blessed to have him. I know he's already been a great tight end for us, but he is going to continue to get better and better, and I'm excited about that.\"\n\nLeft guard Tyler Smith could be an All-Pro in 2024 Tyler Smith DAL * OG * #73 View Profile\n\nDallas left guard Tyler Smith, the team's first-round pick in 2022, shined in his second season en route to his first Pro Bowl selection. His 74.5 offensive grade ranked as Pro Football Focus' ninth-best figure among guards who played a minimum of 600 snaps. Smith dominated as a run-blocker last season, earning a 79.7 PFF run-blocking grade, the sixth-highest among NFL guards to accumulate 600 or more snaps.\n\nNow that he has positional stability at left guard with 2024 first-round pick Tyler Guyton slotted in as the left tackle of the future, Smith is ready to shine as a full-time left guard, something he indicated by mauling Rams defensive tackle Kobie Turner in the run game.\n\n\"It felt great,\" Smith said post-practice. \"That's what we're here to do. We're here to open up lanes for them [running backs], to go out and show their athleticism and who they are as running backs. That's something that we can be better on. I don't think I could have dominated every run. I want to dominate every single run block and I know that that might be an unrealistic expectation, but that's what I want to do every run. .... So it felt good to just be able to have them getting those open lanes and run.\"\n\nCenter Brock Hoffman holding off third-round rookie Cooper Beebe for starting job Brock Hoffman DAL * C * #67 View Profile\n\nWhen the Cowboys selected back-to-back Big 12 Offensive Lineman of the Year Cooper Beebe out of Kansas State in the third round of the 2024 NFL Draft, it was assumed he would be in line to succeed Pro Bowler Tyler Biadasz as Dallas' starting center.\n\nEarly on in camp, 25-year-old undrafted center Brock Hoffman has predominantly lined up with the starting offense, and more than held his own at that spot.\n\n\"I think he's holding [Cooper Beebe] off in a very impressive way,\" Jones said Thursday. \"Brock Hoffman was, when we were discussing our offensive line during the spring and looking for the draft and looking at free agency, his name came up and [we] said, 'Boy, don't discount him.' He's really impressive and he is evolving. He's getting better and better and better. You're seeing that, and I think he is a starting center in the NFL.\"\n\nDespite Hoffman being a backup last season, his voice held some weight in the locker room because of his unyielding passion for the game of football, something Prescott highlighted post-practice.\n\n\"A lot of the reason I'm sure he's here is because of his passion for the game,\" Prescott said of Hoffman. \"His intensity. It was great. It's exactly what it's been at practice. A guy that gets up there, is confident in his calls. Then from there, setting the tempo, allowing me to push the tempo. Just our whole operation was great. Just looking to continue to build off of that.\"\n\nDefenseFifth-round rookie CB Caelen Carson flashes Caelen Carson DAL * DB * #41 View Profile\n\nDallas opted for youth over experience along its cornerback depth chart, allowing 33-year-old, five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Stephon Gilmore to remain in free agency and opting to draft 22-year-old cornerback Caelen Carson in the fifth round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of Wake Forest.\n\nCarson has been impressing in camp, and on Thursday, he hauled in an aggressive red zone interception off Los Angeles backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo -- someone whom the Cowboys struggled to beat when he was the starter for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\"I've been impressed,\" Prescott said of Carson. \"He's a guy that's aggressive. Obviously, he's being coached the right way. We've got some older guys (Trevon Diggs, DaRon Bland) to learn from in that room who do it exactly that way: who are aggressive, who make plays, who know when to take those shots and get those big time plays. I'm not surprised, I'm looking forward to watching that tape and watching Carson and some of those other guys who have been doing well against us, seeing how that transitions into these guys (against the Rams Thursday) and even come the (preseason) game on Sunday.\"\n\n2023 first-round DT Mazi Smith shows off strength Mazi Smith DAL * DT * #58 View Profile\n\nGetting back to his ideal playing weight and role up front has 2023 first-round pick Mazi Smith looking like someone who can contribute in 2024 based off some of his work in drills against the Rams.\n\nHere he opened up a rush lane for fellow defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa.\n\nMicah Parsons is still Micah Parsons Micah Parsons DAL * LB * #11 View Profile\n\nBreaking news: Micah Parsons, the 2023 NFL leader in quarterback pressures (103), quarterback pressure rate (21.8%) and pass-rush win rate (35.3%), is still excellent at flustering opposing quarterbacks.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford was quickly reminded of that fact Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_podell@cbssports.com", "name": "Garrett Podell", "type": "author",

The Cowboys open the preseason Sunday against the Rams, but Prescott was not going to play. He has not played in a preseason game since Mike McCarthy became coach in 2020.\n\nThe Cowboys had their most competitive practice of training camp Thursday. Prescott, who turned 31 on July 29, did not appear to be limited in his movements.\n\nLast month, Prescott briefly wore a walking boot after what was described as a right foot sprain after some workouts before training camp.\n\nIn 2020, Prescott suffered a fractured and dislocated right ankle in a Week 5 win against the New York Giants. He returned the following season and missed one game because of a calf strain.\n\nHe has talked about the lengths that he goes to keep his ankle in good shape with a prolonged warmup and pre-habilitation regiment.\n\nAfter today's workout, the Cowboys do not return for a full practice until Tuesday. On Saturday, the team has a walkthrough and on Sunday morning will travel to SoFi Stadium from Oxnard, California, to Los Angeles for the preseason game.\n\nPrescott has not missed a training camp practice since suffering a strained right latissimus in 2021. Coming off his ankle injury, he did not play in the preseason and threw for 403 yards and three touchdowns in Week 1 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe Cowboys and Prescott have had talks regarding a contract extension. He is set to become a free agent after the season as he plays out the final year of a four-year, $160 million deal he signed in 2021.

That's why the Cowboys are being extra cautious with the quarterback Friday and holding Prescott out of practice a day after Dallas' joint practice with the Los Angeles Rams. The team is calling his absence precautionary as it is occurring because of ankle soreness. The quarterback suffered a compound fracture dislocation in his right ankle back in 2020, an injury that ended his season that year.\n\nThe 31-year-old wore a walking boot back in July while on a deep sea fishing trip in order to combat ankle soreness from sitting for a while in the boat.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm getting older. It was the same ankle that I snapped and had a nasty surgery on four years ago, so yeah a couple hard days of training, you get a little sore,\" Prescott said in July. \"Then, you're going on a fishing trip, and you want to protect it and make sure things don't get worse. Literally, it is absolutely nothing. People are reaching, trying to make things that they aren't. I'm getting older, have to take care of my body. I have to be smart, and if I can take precautions and lessen something by putting on a boot, I'm going to do it. Sorry that I caused such a whirlwind.\"\n\nIn short, Prescott's absence isn't much to worry about, and even if he wasn't missing practice on Friday, he probably wouldn't be playing in Dallas' first preseason game on Sunday at the Rams regardless. McCarthy has never played Prescott in a preseason game since becoming the coach of the Cowboys in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_podell@cbssports.com", "name": "Garrett Podell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_boot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walking boot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/08/06/7a7ea435-03a1-4f73-9545-ca36fac7f0d5/thumbnail/1200x675/066c4062cdf3eac0b4988b6b758ce907/dak-g2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805212", "eventUri": "eng-9805212", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The team would have to play out this year with Super Bowl aspirations on one hand, and the void of unfathomable uncertainty on the other. Not an easy way to approach an NFL year.\n\nIt would all set up a possibility that Prescott would land elsewhere next winter. At the contract site Spotrac, the subject of Prescott's future was taken up by the experts there on the \"Spotrac Podcast\", and one of the most probable resolutions of a Prescott free agency was raised, one that would be especially unpalatable for even the biggest of Dak detractors: Prescott landing with the NFC East rival Giants.\n\nIn rattling off a list -- a lengthy one at that -- of potential suitors for Prescott, NFL contract expert Mike Ginnitti of Spotrac highlighted the urgency the Giants could feel to get Prescott to New York, especially if the team cuts ties with Daniel Jones as expected.\n\n\"For sure the Giants ... The Giants need him today, let alone March 12,\" Ginnitti said.\n\nThe issue the Cowboys have in handling Prescott's situation is that the team has very little leverage in the negotiations. Prescott is well-taken-care-of this year, with a $54 million 2024 payout on the books. He does not have the urgency for a new deal of a player working on an undervalued contract, and he can rest assured that there will be a market for his services when free agency comes around.\n\nGinnitti and podcast partner Dan Soemann rattled off a list of eight potential 2025 offseason destinations for Prescott, including obvious candidates like the Raiders and Steelers, as well as eye-openers like the 49ers and Broncos.\n\nAs Soemann said, \"He's never had more leverage than he's ever going to have right now. Even if the Cowboys come to him and go, 'Listen, here's a really competitive contract, we want you to be here for life,' he's in position to just say, 'Kiss off,' at this point.\"\n\nPrescott has arranged the table nicely for an impending free-agent bonanza, one that could capitalize on a skyrocketing salary cap and the corresponding skyrocketing salaries for QBs. He needs to make sure he cashes in.\n\n\"He's got to get to free agency, that's the point. ... They owe it to themselves to get to free agency and in this case, I think Dak Prescott owes it to himself to get to free agency as well,\" Ginnitti said.\n\nAs for Prescott, the Cowboys should be a bit concerned that he has carried himself with such swagger throughout training camp this year. That's good for the 2024 season, of course, but it also indicates that knows well he is the one who holds the cards in the contract stare-down.\n\nAs he said last week, via Fox 4:\n\n\"I've got a ton of confidence, but honestly, it's not something I think about. I'm here in training camp and focused on this year. I'm on a contract for this year and that's all I really care about. Having a kid, your perspective changes a little bit in life. A lot of quarterbacks have [played for other teams]. That's just the business and nature of this game. That's just me not being naive to that.\n\n\"[Leaving is] not something I look for, or prepare, even plan for, but if something like that happens, I'll certainly be ready for it.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_deveney@heavy.com", "name": "Sean Deveney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165412198_1cb437-e1723221607311.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805212", "eventUri": "eng-9805212", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-12", "textStart": 1086, "textEnd": 1094}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

I could play a game right now.\"\n\nBut instead, what he will do is play a game in Cleveland - with Dallas hoping for another \"hell of a day'' from him.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_fisher@postandcourier.com", "name": "Mike Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Lance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trey Lance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Rush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805212", "eventUri": "eng-9805212", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-08", "textStart": 1050, "textEnd": 1057}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

With months of rumors indicating owner Jerry Jones' lack of interest in paying his athletes including Dak Prescott, new reports suggest that the QB might now bag a $70 million per year contract.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers recently stunned the NFL world by entrusting relatively new signal caller Jordan Love with a bumper $55 million per year contract.\n\nAfter the deal was announced, many expected veteran QB Dak Prescott to break the $60 million per year barrier in the next cycle of their extension. But what nobody saw coming was him being considered for a $70 million-a-year contract.\n\nIf the latest reports from Mike Fisher of Athlon Sports [via Dov Kleiman] are to be trusted, Dak might be on the brink of signing a $70 million/year contract if he plays the cards right. Ever since the reports surfaced on the internet, netizens have been left stunned.\n\nThe numbers were so outrageous for netizens to digest that they expressed their utter disbelief in Jerry Jones shattering the NFL QB wage structure for Dak Prescott.\n\nWhile the majority termed the deal too good to be true, a few fans gave the benefit of the doubt. However, they still weren't happy as they argued that monstrous contracts cripple teams by not allowing them to spend big on quality players in other positions. So if the reports were to prove their veracity, these fans argued that they would be super upset with Dak and Jones.\n\nA few netizens also started questioning Dak Prescott's pedigree post the rumors. Luckily for them, netizens were soon reminded of Dak's talents, courtesy of the footage from the Cowboys and Rams' joint training camp.\n\nWhile it's undeniable that Dak Prescott and the Cowboys have constantly underperformed in the playoffs, his pedigree as a regular-season QB has never been in doubt. After all, this is a QB who has dazzled over the years with his capability as a passer, a prime example being his 4,516 passing yards and NFL-leading 36 touchdowns last season.\n\nSo when fans were doubting Prescott's worth as a $70 million QB, the footage from the Rams-Cowboys' joint practice was a perfectly timed blessing.\n\nIn the footage, Dak Prescott looked in sublime form as he was seen effortlessly throwing fine passes from the deep to his receivers. As an athlete, Dak looked fitter than ever as he was able to evade the Rams' defense with silky smoothness.\n\nConsidering the LA Rams are one of the contenders for the NFC Championship this season, Dallas' training camp domination should serve the Cowboys with a booster shot of confidence.\n\nThe footage also signifies that despite the uncertainty around their top stars, the locker room seems calm as seen from their performances in the camp so far. As always, expectations will be rife for the Dallas Cowboys this season.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suresh_menon@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Suresh Menon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/08/1383a3a7-yagya-fis-2024-08-09t075306.730.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805212", "eventUri": "eng-9805212", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

His girlfriend once called him \u201cthe patron saint of Canton.\u201d That girlfriend, Karen Read, is now on trial, accused of killing O\u2019Keefe in a case that has attracted national attention and called into question the integrity of a wide swath of Massachusetts' law enforcement community and even some of O'Keefe's friends. Born and raised in suburban Braintree, O\u2019Keefe graduated from Northeastern University and earned a master\u2019s in criminal justice from the University of Massachusetts. He was 46 at the time of his death, and had been a Boston police officer for 16 years. For much of that time, O\u2019Keefe also had been raising his niece and nephew in Canton after his sister and her husband died just months apart. He also lost his best friend, fellow Boston Officer Pat Rogers, to suicide. Rogers\u2019 girlfriend was pregnant at the time, and O\u2019Keefe quickly stepped up to support her as well, acting as godfather to her son. \u201cHe was the first person in my delivery room after I gave birth,\u201d Laura Sullivan testified during the trial, describing O\u2019Keefe as a \u201cconstant\u201d presence in her son\u2019s life. \"Every birthday, Christmas, he was always in contact. He was the first person in my delivery room after i gave birth. he was a constant,\" she added.

Other witnesses described O\u2019Keefe\u2019s devotion to his niece and nephew, who called him J-J and were just 6 and 3 when he became their guardian. O'Keefe's sister-in-law, Erin, testified that she and her husband had been prepared to take in the children as well, but O'Keefe stepped up. \u201dWe had kind of assumed because Johnny was out, you know, on the streets doing his job, that Paul and I would take the kids,\" she said. \u201cJohnny said he was going to do it.\u201d O'Keefe was known as a father figure to his family, and was also involved with his friends' families. \"Him and my husband would always do the games. The kids use to call them my two dads. It was, they had a lot of fun together,\" added Katherine Camerano. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s younger brother, Paul, was the first witness called by the prosecution. Asked to name his siblings, he struggled to stay composed when naming his late sister and \u201cmy brother John.\u201d Everyone called him Johnny, he said, \u201cespecially if you were family.\u201d Paul O'Keefe said he had planned to see his brother the day before he died, but they canceled because of a coming snowstorm. Their last communication was in a group text with family members. John O\u2019Keefe was excited, he said, because their niece had been accepted to a private high school.", "summary": "<p>John O\u2019Keefe\u2019s title was Boston police officer, but to those who loved him, he was Johnny, J-J or affectionately, the Godfather.

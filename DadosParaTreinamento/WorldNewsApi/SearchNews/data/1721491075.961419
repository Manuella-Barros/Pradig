{"id": 237079318, "title": "Presidency, Obi clash over new presidential jet", "text": "The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on Monday, faulted the plan by the Federal Government to buy new aircraft for the presidential fleets. He described the move as insensitive while Nigerians grapple with economic hardship occasioned by the Federal Government\u2019s policies. But the Presidency, in a swift reaction, described Obi\u2019s comment as insensitive, wondering if he would rather have the life of the President jeopardised by flying faulty aircraft. Speaking with The PUNCH on Monday, the Special Adviser to President Bola Tinubu on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, said, \u201cDoes Peter Obi want the President dead? Is that his wish? Does he want him to continue moving around in a rickety plane and die like the VP of Malawi and Iran President? Let him tell us. This is a basic thing any sane government will do. You can\u2019t toy with your President\u2019s welfare. \u201cThe plane he used now, I learnt, was bought during (former President) Obasanjo\u2019s era. That was over 20 years ago and I learnt it was a very small plane. The plane developed a problem the last time he travelled to Saudi Arabia. The President had to go from there to the UK on a commercial airline. Even those managing them said the aircraft needed to be replaced. \u201cWhy will any right-thinking person still want the President to move around in it? In any way, it is the National Assembly that officially recommended that new ones should be bought. Sometimes, Peter Obi opened his mouth to make unnecessary statements.\u201d The House of Representatives Committee on National Security and Intelligence had recently called on the FG to buy new aircraft for President Bola Tinubu and Vice-President Kashim Shettima. The committee\u2019s recommendation was contained in a report released after it investigated the status of the aircraft in the presidential air fleet. The recommendation comes a few months after three planes from the Presidential Air Fleet were pencilled down for sale. But Obi described the move as unacceptable and a clear show of insensitivity to the suffering of the Nigerian people. Reacting on his X handle on Monday, the former Anambra governor said it was rather unfortunate that at a time when the country was making headlines over the economic crisis, occasioned by hyperinflation, a falling currency and widespread poverty, the FG was contemplating securing new presidential jets. He said, \u201cThis demonstrates extreme insensitivity to citizens\u2019 struggles. With rising insecurity, poverty, hunger, and homelessness, this decision highlights the disconnect that is apparent between the government and the people. It is unacceptable as the situation in the country today more than ever demands a more compassionate use of resources, prioritising citizens\u2019 welfare. \u201cIt is on record that our presidential jets have an average age of 12 years, purchased when most Nigerians could afford necessities. Now, as our country faces significant challenges, including a high debt profile, our citizens are in even greater need. Instead of adding to our luxuries, we should be focused on alleviating their suffering and finding solutions to their problems. \u201cWhile we had earlier refurbished the old VP residence with $2m, the over 100-year-old US Vice President\u2019s house has only undergone wide-scale renovations twice, funded by taxpayers\u2019 money; in 1993 and 2021. Every new US VP is free to finance any minor refurbishing from his funds. \u201cIt is, therefore, time to stop this impunity, insensitivity, and shamelessness and refocus on the needs of our people. We must prioritise education, healthcare, and lifting our citizens out of poverty. Let us work together to build a nation that truly serves its people, not just the interests of a few.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on Monday, faulted the plan by the Federal Government to buy new aircraft for the presidential fleets.

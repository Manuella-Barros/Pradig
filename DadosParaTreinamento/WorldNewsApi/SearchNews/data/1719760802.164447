{"id": 226345284, "title": "A chic picnic can transport you to France", "text": "With fair weather settling in and summer on the horizon, what I want to serve friends is a bright, sort-of-French pique-nique spread. In France, with cheese shops, bakeries and fine prepared foods available in every neighborhood, it\u2019s easy to have an impromptu picnic \u2014 at a park, in the woods or on a river bank \u2014 at the drop of a (straw) hat. All of the dishes here are strikingly Francophile. But as a colleague mentioned to me, it\u2019s not fancy or fussy, it\u2019s just good, simple French food. I see it as a buffet, served in the backyard with everything at room temperature, though it could also easily travel to the beach. And if you get rained out, it\u2019s still delicious indoors. I want vegetables at my picnic, so there are two salads in this menu. First is a straightforward, old-fashioned French potato salad with chives and tarragon. Medium waxy potatoes are boiled and peeled, then thickly sliced, then coated in an easy dressing. A generous dribble of fruity extra-virgin olive oil is customary. Then, there is a colorful green bean and cherry tomato salad, finished with a black olive dressing. For the best result, choose the smallest green beans and the sweetest cherry tomatoes. The dressing, made with Ni\u00e7oise olives, capers, anchovy and garlic, is similar to a Proven\u00e7al tapenade. The beans and tomatoes benefit from a short bath in the mixture. Add arugula or other salad greens just before serving, if you wish. For something grilled, consider this pepper-crusted flank steak. Flank tends to be less expensive and has a reputation for being tougher, but it can be just as tender if cooked to medium-rare and sliced thinly on a diagonal. A rather large amount of coarse crushed black peppercorns coats this flank steak for a distinctive burst of flavor. It\u2019s best to crush your own pepper, with a mortar and pestle or an electric spice mill. Patting the pepper on both sides of the steak well in advance of the cooking ensures the seasoning will penetrate. Cook your steak over coals, in a covered gas grill, in a cast-iron pan on the stove or under the broiler. It may be served warm or at room temperature. Raspberry-almond clafoutis is one of the simplest desserts out there. You mix up a little batter and pour it over fruit in a baking dish \u2014 nothing more. A traditional clafoutis is made with cherries, but here they\u2019re replaced with raspberries, which have a slight tartness. I devised a gluten-free version with almond flour and a little almond extract. It\u2019s a pretty dessert, dusted with powdered sugar. Staying true to the French theme, be sure your picnic includes chilled ros\u00e9, a lightly sparkling water and a freshly baked baguette or two. In this straightforward, old-fashioned French potato salad with chives and tarragon, medium waxy potatoes are boiled and peeled while still warm, so they best absorb the flavors. They\u2019re then thickly sliced and splashed with an easy vinaigrette. A generous dribble of fruity extra-virgin olive oil is customary \u2014 don\u2019t skimp on it. Makes 6 generous servings INGREDIENTS 2\u00bd to 3 pounds yellow-fleshed potatoes, such as Yukon Gold Salt and black pepper 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 6 tablespoons fruity extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed 1 tablespoon tarragon leaves 1 tablespoon snipped chives DIRECTIONS 1. Put potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, salt generously and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a brisk simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes, until cooked through but firm. (Test with a skewer or paring knife.) Drain. 2. Holding each potato in a paper towel or tea towel to keep from burning your fingers, peel the thin skins while still warm with a paring knife (they come away easily). Cut peeled potatoes into thick slices (about 3/8 inch) and place in a large low bowl. 3. In a small bowl, add vinegar and mustard, stirring to dissolve. Whisk in olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour over warm sliced potatoes and very gently and briefly toss with hands, taking care not to break the slices. Sprinkle with a little salt and leave to cool at room temperature. 4. When potatoes have cooled, add tarragon leaves and chives (save some of the herbs for garnish) and very gently toss again. Taste, adjust for salt and toss one more time. The salad should be fairly oily; drizzle with a little more oil if necessary. Serve at room temperature, sprinkled with reserved herbs. This colorful, full-flavored salad is finished with a black olive dressing, made with Ni\u00e7oise olives, capers, anchovy and garlic, and similar to a Proven\u00e7al tapenade. For the best result, choose the smallest green beans and sweetest cherry tomatoes. Add arugula or other salad greens just before serving, if you wish. Makes 6 servings INGREDIENTS Salt and black pepper \u00bd pound small green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces 2 cups cherry tomatoes of various colors (about 10 ounces), halved \u00bc cup pitted Ni\u00e7oise olives, roughly chopped 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons lemon juice, plus \u00bd teaspoon lemon zest 1 tablespoon capers, roughly chopped 2 anchovy fillets, roughly chopped 1 large garlic clove, grated A handful of arugula or small lettuce leaves DIRECTIONS 1. Bring a small pot of salted water to a boil, add green beans and cook for 2 minutes. 2. Drain, spread beans on a kitchen towel and cool to room temperature. 3. Put beans and cherry tomatoes in a low bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. 4. In a small bowl, combine olives, olive oil, lemon juice and zest, capers, anchovy, and garlic. Whisk together and pour over beans and tomatoes. Toss to coat. Check seasoning and adjust. Leave at room temperature. 5. Just before serving, garnish bean-tomato mixture with arugula or salad greens. Coarse crushed black peppercorns coat this flank steak for a zesty burst of flavor, complementing the rare grilled meat. It\u2019s best to crush your own, in a mortar and pestle or spice mill. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 6 servings INGREDIENTS 1 flank steak, about 2 pounds 2 tablespoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) 3 tablespoons coarse crushed black peppercorns DIRECTIONS 1. Pat steak dry. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt on each side. 2. Coat both sides of the steak with the crushed pepper, pressing down to coat evenly. Allow to rest and absorb seasoning for at least 1 hour. 3. Bring steak to room temperature. Grill over medium-hot coals or a covered gas grill at 450 degrees, about 4 to 5 minutes per side, until juices appear on the surface of the steak. Check with a meat thermometer; 125 degrees for rare, 130 for medium-rare. (Alternatively, cook in a cast-iron pan over medium-high heat or broil.) Let rest at least 10 minutes before slicing.) 4. With a sharp knife, slice on a slight bias against the grain, about 1/8-inch thick. Arrange on a serving platter. Serve warm or at room temperature. A traditional clafoutis is made with cherries, replaced here with raspberries, which have a slight tartness. The batter is made with almond flour and a little almond extract for a gluten-free version. Cool to room temperature before serving. Makes 6 to 8 servings INGREDIENTS 1 cup/112 grams almond flour \u00bd cup/100 grams granulated sugar 3 large eggs \u00bd teaspoon almond extract Pinch of salt 1\u00bc cups/300 milliliters half-and-half Unsalted butter, for greasing pan 3 cups/320 grams raspberries (12 ounces) Powdered sugar, for serving DIRECTIONS 1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Put almond flour, sugar, eggs, almond extract and salt in a blender. Blend at medium speed for a minute or so, until well combined. Scrape the bowl as necessary. Add half-and-half and blend again. 2. Butter a 10-inch round baking dish or cast-iron skillet. Arrange raspberries over the bottom of the dish. 3. Pour batter over berries. Bake on the top oven rack for 30 to 35 minutes, until puffed and lightly browned on top. (A knife inserted into the center should emerge clean.) 4. Cool clafoutis to room temperature. Sprinkle top with powdered sugar. Serve directly from baking dish, in large wedges. Recipes by David Tanis.

{"id": 225025380, "title": "Should I upgrade the brakes on my 2007 SUV?", "text": "Q. I have a 2007 Mercury Mountaineer with a V8 engine and 137,000 trouble-free miles. I\u2019d like to keep the truck for another five years. The SUV has always gone through brake rotors like tissues, with warping and atrocious stopping distances throughout my ownership. I would love to upgrade the brakes, but I cannot get a clear answer as to what is feasible. Are there cost-effective, aftermarket larger brake rotors and/or master cylinders that could decrease stopping distance and prolong the brake rotor life? I once compared my brake rotors to an F-150\u2019s rotors with both vehicles up on the lift at my garage, and noticed how much more robust the F-150 rotors were. Is it a simple job to swap brake systems? A. Great question, and I\u2019m a little jealous that you have a lift in your garage. The Ford Sport Trac (built on a similar platform as the Explorer) might be a better alternative to the F-150 pickup. The Sport Trac has larger rotors, but you would need to change the spindles, most likely the master cylinder, combination valve, and maybe even the ABS pump. The issue could also be a problem with the rear brakes. If the rear brakes are getting lazy, the front brakes could be getting too hot. Other than that, I know lots of people have gone to slotted rotors, but I usually don\u2019t see enough improvement to justify the cost. If it were me, on the next brake job, I would change the flex hoses (they get clogged), clean and lube the slides, replace or rebuild the calipers, and most important, remove corrosion from the wheel mounting surface \u2013 both disc mounting surfaces and hub mounting surface. Just a little rust can cause rotors to go out of round. Then torque the wheels with a torque wrench. Q. What should I keep in my car in case of emergencies? What I really want to know is what you keep in your car. I\u2019m guessing a portable jump-pack for starters. Is there a brand that you like? A. We have three cars in our household, and they all have small duffle bags with a few emergency items. For a jump-pack, I have had the best luck with the NOCO brand. It seems to be the most resistant to moisture and temperature variations. I have portable air compressors to connect to the car\u2019s battery. One is from WORX and it uses the same batteries as other WORX tools that I have. As a temporary tire repair, I also keep a tire plug kit. I also have some basic hand tools, flares/reflectors, gloves, and duct tape. Q. My wife loves the Volvo XC40. She asked me to ask you for three other small SUVs that you would recommend. A. The Volvo XC40 is a well-rounded vehicle and a tough competitor in its class. I would look at the Genesis GV60 and the Lexus NX. Two cars I like but I am a little afraid of long-term maintenance costs are the Jaguar I-PACE (a really nice car) and the Audi Q3. If your wife \u201cloves\u201d the Volvo XC40, that might be the best choice. Happy wife, happy life. Q. I own a 2018 plug-in hybrid Honda Clarity. I really like the car and I especially like driving it in electric mode. The range for all-electric mode varies from about 30 to 50 miles, depending on temperature and type of driving. My question is, is it OK to drive almost exclusively in electric mode and use very little gas? Does the car need to run in hybrid mode on occasion to circulate the oil throughout the engine? Also, how often should the oil be changed considering the car is mostly driven in electric mode? A. The car is designed to drive in EV mode as much as possible. I would add fuel stabilizer to keep the fuel fresh. Regarding oil changes, if the maintenance reminder doesn\u2019t come on to signal an oil change, change the oil once per year. Other than that, change the brake fluid every three years, follow the maintenance reminder for other normal service and enjoy your hybrid. John Paul is AAA Northeast\u2019s Car Doctor.

Due to this, health experts have expressed their concerns about the risks of functioning alcoholism caused by an increase in the consumption of alcohol units in an average week. According to a survey from Opinium, over half of the country (56 per cent) admitted to drinking once a week or more when the weather improves. Addiction specialists from private rehab clinic Delamere have listed some of the common signs of functioning alcoholism that people can look out for in themselves or others. Functioning alcoholism could describe a person struggling with their drinking habits but are still able to hold down a job and act normal as a work colleague or family member, Wales Online reports. The signs are not always easy to spot as those struggling from alcoholism are particularly good at hiding their condition. As there seems to be not many negative consequences, a functioning alcoholic is unlikely to want to change their habits if they don't see it as a problem.

When discussing this sensitive topic, it is important that you get the person to admit they have a problem that they need support to help overcome. If you have previously discussed this and they initially became defensive, then you may want to follow these tips in order to approach it better. Firstly, set a time aside to talk to them when they have no plans and are not intoxicated already. Preferably they will be sober but if they are dependant on alcohol then it would be good to choose a time before they begin drinking heavily. It is also helpful to speak to a functioning alcoholic about their issues after they have just suffered a negative consequence related to the drinking. This may make the person remorseful and less able to deny they have an issue. Tell the person what you know of alcoholism and the signs and symptoms of functioning alcoholism. Explain to them that alcoholism is not only recognised as a mental condition but also physiological, and that they don't need to lose everything in life to have a problem with drinking. They should not feel ashamed that they suffer from an illness that requires treatment in order to overcome. Regardless of any emotional response, try to keep calm and not engage in an argumentative stance. Arguing will give them an excuse to leave the conversation and return to their drinking. Instead, try an empathetic approach and one of showing concern and support. If it is, explain how their drinking is affecting you and other people and give examples of this. Acknowledge that the condition is much more common than they think and there are others out there who are dealing with it as well. Explain to them that people suffering from an alcohol use disorder are rarely able to get better of their own accord - due to their brain compelling them to drink and alcoholism being heavily connected to relapse. Tell them that there are many negative consequences hat non-functioning alcoholics suffer: such as a loss of relationships, jobs, criminal acts, mental issues and physical deterioration. Give them hope by explaining that alcoholism is treatable and that getting into rehab or performing a professional detox will be good for them to get well again. If the conversation goes well, the functioning alcoholic admits they have a problem and they need help, it is important to act quickly and without hesitation. Acting quickly and getting professional help while they are accepting could be the key to saving their life. If they return to defensive or confrontational means, then drop the subject and try again on a different day.", "summary": "It can be difficult to spot the underlying signs and symptoms of functioning alcoholism but it can crop up unexpectedly in the summer due to the UK's drinking culture.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/expert-lists-17-signs-functioning-32916863", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32917475.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1904522489.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:49:05", "author": "Abbie Meehan,Ketsuda Phoutinane,Neil Shaw", "authors": ["Abbie Meehan", "Ketsuda Phoutinane", "Neil Shaw"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.182}

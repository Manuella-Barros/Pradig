They have all performed well in every fashion, and the singer has shown many times in the past that she can sell a project like few in the industry these days. This week, the superstar proves this fact once again on a particular Billboard chart. Two of Swift\u2019s most beloved collections return to the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart. The pair of efforts both find their way back to the uppermost region on the purchase-focused tally at the same time\u2026and impressively, they\u2019re not her only wins inside the loftiest tier this time around. Swift\u2019s highest-ranking returning winner inside the top 10 on this week\u2019s Top Album Sales chart is Lover. The 2019 pop project jumps from No. 11 to No. 9. According to Luminate, Lover was purchased by 5,981 fans in the U.S. during the last tracking frame. That number is actually down nearly 6% from the period before, when it sold 6,342 copies. Just one spot lower comes another rising winner. 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) bolts from No. 13 to No. 10 on the Top Album Sales list. Like Lover, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) actually falls when looking at the total number of copies sold, but it still performed well enough to rise back into the top 10. The title sold 5,597 copies, which is a decline of a little more than 7% when compared to the seven-day period prior. As both Lover and the re-recorded take on 1989 rise and make a home inside the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart, Swift finally steps aside on top of the ranking. The Tortured Poets Department has led the charge for four weeks, and it\u2019s only been present on the list for half a dozen turns. This frame, it\u2019s replaced by Twenty One Pilots\u2019 Clancy, which opens at No. 1.

That pales in comparison to the 113,000 copies that Clancy managed in its debut frame. That sum is enough for the bestseller to settle at No. 3.

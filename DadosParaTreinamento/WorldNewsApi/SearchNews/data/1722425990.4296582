{"id": 243259682, "title": "Transgender China actress makes historic debut in UK television drama", "text": "Actress Jaylin Ye has made history by becoming the first Chinese transgender female character to appear on British television with her debut in the Amazon Prime series Dead Hot. The six-episode comedy thriller follows friends and amateur detectives Jess and Elliott as they investigate the disappearance of Peter, Jess\u2019s twin brother, and the love of Elliott\u2019s life. Ye plays Karis, Elliott\u2019s college friend, who joins the team in the third episode. Her performance has been praised as \u201cdownright hilarious\u201d by reviewer Shannon Connellan on the global entertainment platform Mashable. The series premiered in the UK and Ireland on March 1 and became available in the US and Canada on Tubi from March 27. Last summer, Ye spent about six weeks filming in Liverpool, northwest England, for her first-ever appearance in a television series. This marks the first recorded instance of a Chinese transgender female character in a British television series. The trailer, featuring Ye, even played on the big screen in New York City\u2019s Times Square. \u201cAs an immigrant, a Chinese and a trans woman, I feel that this step is historically significant, proving that people like us can reach the mainstream,\u201d Ye told the Post. \u201cYou\u2019re China\u2019s own Hunter Schafer,\u201d an online observer commented on Ye\u2019s post on Xiaohongshu. \u201cI love this show. You are fantastic in it,\u201d said another. Ye, in her 20s, was born and raised in Guangdong province in southern China. She earned dual bachelor\u2019s degrees in Chinese studies and graphic design at a mainland university. From a young age, she sensed she was \u201csomehow different\u201d and was bullied for being a \u201csissy\u201d. Ye, originally identifying as non-binary, later came out as a transgender female in August 2022. Commencing hormone therapy last year, she expressed gratitude for the supportive queer community in Britain. Hormone therapy marks the beginning of one\u2019s journey towards gender transition and gender-affirming surgeries are not a prerequisite for individuals to be recognised as transgender. She told the Post that embracing her female identity brought her immense confidence and comfort. In 2018, Ye graduated from the University of Manchester in the UK with a master\u2019s degree in marketing and returned to Guangdong, where she worked at a local international school. However, she soon realised it was not the life she wanted. In November 2020, Ye seized an opportunity to move back to Manchester and worked in the fashion industry as a makeup artist and model. Acting was initially just a hobby when she belonged to her university\u2019s drama club. In 2021, she began taking weekly acting workshops and signed with her first agency. \u201cYou need to stop daydreaming. You\u2019re not professionally trained and you do not look particularly good,\u201d her mother told her, like many East Asian parents, habitually dismissing her child\u2019s dreams despite her love. \u201cI told my mum that my face appeared on the big screen in Times Square. She asked, \u2018What is Times Square?\u2019,\u201d Ye said. Her achievements eventually got her mother\u2019s support, though her father still believed she should pursue a more stable career. In March last year, with her natural humour, she secured the role of Karis in Dead Hot after just one audition. The casting director later told her that her audition tape was the only one that made everyone laugh. Initially, Karis was written as a cisgender woman. \u201cThe Amazon team did not know I was transgender at first. I\u2019m grateful I got the role because of my performance, not my identity. This is more significant to me because, as an actress, I don\u2019t want to be limited to transgender roles,\u201d Ye said. She looks forward to continuing her efforts to increase the representation of Chinese and transgender communities and hopes to further explore her potential in the US. \u201cMy roots are Chinese, and I will always strive to incorporate Chinese elements into my work. I have a big dream that, one day, when I stand on an awards ceremony stage, I will tell everyone that I am native-born Chinese,\u201d Ye told the Post. \u201cI want to convey the message, \u2018Come on, let\u2019s be real, there are millions of queer people in China\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll write a book someday about my story.\u201d", "summary": "Jaylin Ye says she is proud to be the first native-born Chinese transgender actress to appear in a British TV drama.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/gender-diversity/article/3268289/transgender-china-actress-makes-historic-debut-uk-television-drama", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/28/8580d394-0a05-4ff0-8633-e3b0486b9051_6ed00712.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:00:11", "author": "Iris Jiang", "authors": ["Iris Jiang"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.735}

{"id": 243256322, "title": "Gareth Jenkins: Five key moments from Post Office inquiry", "text": "Four days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt \u201cbetter with systems than people\u201d. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. \"Can't you use the report I have already sent you?\" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this \"over with\". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely.", "summary": "Key moments from former Fujitsu engineer Gareth Jenkins' long-awaited appearance at the Post Office inquiry.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c880e78rl77o", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9142/live/46efa590-34aa-11ef-a044-9d4367d5b599.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:12:31", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.073}

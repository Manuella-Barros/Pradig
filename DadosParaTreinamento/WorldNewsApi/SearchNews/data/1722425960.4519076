During the second inning against the Mets, both shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a \u2014 who had the mic during the Apple TV+ broadcast \u2014 and third baseman Alex Bregman tracked down a seemingly benign pop-up from Jeff McNeil, though neither could actually catch it. As the two ran underneath the ball, there was seemingly no communication over who would take it. Noticing the ball was behind him, Bregman stopped and turned around, hoping to see Pe\u00f1a catch the ball. He did not. Instead, the ball bounced on the dirt between them and a frustrated look quickly surfaced on Pe\u00f1a\u2019s face. Luckily for Pe\u00f1a, the error didn\u2019t impact the inning. McNeil was quickly caught in a pickle while trying to steal second base, and Harrison Bader later struck out to end the frame. A similar instance happened earlier in June to the Dodgers\u2019 Kik\u00e9 Hernandez, who committed an error while interviewing with Apple TV+ announcers Wayne Randazzo and Dontrelle Willis. Willis asked: \u201cYou guys are [a] very close-knit ball club. Where does that come from?\u201d just as the Yankees\u2019 Gleyber Torres hit a ground ball to Hernandez at third base. Before the infielder attempted to field the ball, Willis told Hernandez to answer \u201cafter the play.\u201d However, Hernandez was unable to grab the ball cleanly, and Torres arrived safely at first. After a 2-1 Los Angeles win, Hernandez admitted that the ball bounced strangely and that the interview may have only impacted him a bit. Hernandez said the misplay wouldn\u2019t deter him from agreeing to do an interview in the future, though, as players earn a $10,000 stipend for partaking in the in-game interviews during a regular season game and $15,000 in the playoffs. \u201cNo, because we\u2019re getting paid,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI like money.\u201d", "summary": "A mic\u2019d-up mishap has now plagued the Astros.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/astros-jeremy-pena-flubs-easy-pop-up-in-micd-up-mlb-mishap/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-y2mumh8qg-1719623964553.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719609667&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:42:29", "author": "Bridget Reilly", "authors": ["Bridget Reilly"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.426}

{"id": 231996612, "title": "Weekly Horoscope: June 9-June 15, It Is Time to Build Your Life Patiently", "text": "This week, the wheel of life turns on and we will feel another change of pace. Mars, the planet of energy and passion, will parade into the fields of Taurus from June 9 to July 20. This is a crucial period to focus on how you can patiently, methodically and practically build your personal and professional goals for the long term. We may feel frustration by wanting to speed up the process, but if we are able to center ourselves and focus on proceeding slowly but surely, everything we manifest will be built on a solid foundation. Beware that June 9, June 11 and June 12 could be a bit rocky. We might face some challenges, but luckily as we move toward June 14 and into the weekend, things should be back on track with more clarity! Read on for your weekly horoscope. Aries (March 21 to April 19) You\u2019ve felt fired up for months, Aries, like you\u2019ve been on top of the world. Your energy has likely been through the roof. Starting this week, however, the energy will shift to be far more focused on finances. You could notice that your expenses are erupting and you\u2019re burning through cash on big-ticket items. Your hunger for wealth could also significantly increase. This is a great period to focus on your budget, chase down new income streams or even look for a better-paying job. Charge onward and you may find later in the year that you\u2019re sitting like a lucky leprechaun on a shimmering pot of gold! Taurus (April 20 to May 20) Get ready to feel like a powerhouse, Taurus! You\u2019re always strong, but the universe is infusing you with raw power, speed and adrenaline. Starting this week, you\u2019re being ignited by fire. You will have more dominance, magnetism, courage, energy and sex appeal. From now until mid-July, you must use all of this fuel to take the lead and launch any significant personal or professional initiatives. You\u2019re like a rocket ship! The plans you set in motion now could end up becoming jewels in your crown. Also, regardless of whether you're single or attached, your sexual attraction and libido will be sizzling. Everyone will want a taste of you, so become the sex icon that you\u2019ve been eager to be. Gemini (May 21 to June 20) You have a ton of cosmic favor on your side, Gemini, but there will be a shift in the wind this week. A large part of you will want to be center stage, but there\u2019s also a part of you that needs to focus on spending time in solitude. This may be because you\u2019re deeply engrained in development \u2014 perhaps working on projects behind the scenes that you may launch later this year, especially between July and September. You may also find yourself very focused on your health, especially if your anxiety or fears are causing you grief. Find time for stillness, relaxation and meditation if so. Cancer (June 21 to July 22) You\u2019re going to notice that your social life is suddenly firing up once again, Cancer. This trend lasts until mid-July and it's likely you'll be feeling the need to socialize, connect with friends and get involved in community matters as a result. Expanding your network could be a big priority for you now, whether that\u2019s in person or online. Expect many invitations, lively celebrations and important moments with friends at this time and in the weeks to come. If single, this could be a period that has you especially popular in online dating or igniting sizzling chemistry with an acquaintance in the streets. Leo (July 23 to Aug. 22) You\u2019ve recently been very focused on how you can build various sectors of your life, Leo. However, from now until mid July, you'll be narrowed in on your ambitions, career and professional ascent. You have the best energy to increase your recognition and scale the ladder now, so take advantage of this and make moves! It\u2019s likely big projects could land on your table at this time \u2014 and if you crack the whip and hustle quickly, a promotion, award or competitive job offer could soon be around the corner. Do not let this energy go to waste! Virgo (Aug. 23 to Sept. 22) You may feel an incredible deep fire burning within you to step outside of your comfort zone and shake up your normal routine, Virgo. And guess what? It may come out of nowhere! As much as you like to follow your plans, it\u2019s likely you\u2019re going to consider how you can open yourself to more. Some of you might even find yourselves involved with long-distance travel, international relations or business or immigration. Others could find that they\u2019re deeply invested in academic matters or gaining more wisdom about life. No matter what, pursue the path before you. Ensure it's one that fills you with butterflies and will lead you to new adventures! Libra (Sept. 23 to Oct. 22) You're about to feel a deeper focus on where you stand in a significant partnership this week, Libra. You could find that you\u2019re growing closer with a person of interest, igniting your sense of intimacy or embracing the urge to merge. You realize your attention is placed on wealth instead, especially tied to big-ticket item expenses or paying off debt. There's the best part, though! If you need to apply for money \u2014 such as a credit line or capital \u2014 it could be approved. Scorpio (Oct. 23 to Nov. 21) You\u2019ve had extra special attention on significant relationships for the past year, Scorpio. Beginning this week until around September, you\u2019ll have an even greater need for a union. Flying solo won't get you ahead now, so finding the perfect personal or professional partner should be a top priority. If single, put yourself out there to search for someone with long-term potential. If coupled up, you could be making long-term promises, moving in or taking things to the next level. On a professional note, you could be deeply invested in working with a collaborator \u2014 or even, have extra luck on your side to find the ideal match. This could be an agent, manager, assistant, trainer or someone in your field of work. Sagittarius (Nov. 22 to Dec. 21) You\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities this month for fun and connection, Sagittarius, but note that a shift in the cosmic flow ignites now until mid-July. You\u2019re going to be firing on all cylinders and racing forward like the Energizer Bunny! Productivity is a top priority for you now and it\u2019s likely you\u2019re juggling a million responsibilities, routines, priorities and projects. You might also find yourself taking on big endeavors from your employer or using this energy to find a better job. You may also see progress happen quickly if you want to improve your health, diet or fitness \u2014 so get moving on it now, Sagittarius! Capricorn (Dec. 22 to Jan. 19) Life has been rather sweet in the past year, Capricorn \u2014 and starting this week, it should be even more vibrant for you. You have some of the best cosmic energy in two years to pursue your heart\u2019s desires. This is one of the sweetest periods for singles to line up options or for couples to reignite their spark. (True love could be right around the corner!) All Capricorns will feel more magnetic and attractive now, so expect your desire for romance and sex to beat like a drum! Enjoy this energy by having fun with children or pursuing pregnancy, embracing your hobbies or rolling the dice on games of chance. Above all, prioritize having fun and living in the moment! Aquarius (Jan. 20 to Feb. 18) Beginning this week, there\u2019s a big focus on your domestic and family life, Aquarius. You could be deeply engrained in moving, renovations or redecorating from now until mid-July. Your attention may also be focused on real estate or, whether it be yours already or a desire to get some of your own. On a different note, you may find that there\u2019s tension around family affairs \u2014 or perhaps, you're being required to step in to aid one of your kindred. Be aware that your emotions are particularly fired up now, so find ways of practicing relaxation or mindfulness if you\u2019re feeling tense and agitated. Pisces (Feb. 19 to March 20) Life is back in the fast lane once again, Pisces, and you\u2019ll love the brisk pace! You\u2019re being encouraged to set sail into new horizons, both physically and intellectually. Travel, socializing and learning are big for you now. It's likely that you\u2019ll feel more curious and excited about life at this time and in the weeks ahead. Consider playing tourist in your town or head out to nearby destinations with friends or a lover. Last to note is that some Pisces may suddenly be very focused on intellectual pursuits and communication-related projects. It could be as simple as updating your resume or as big as being featured on a major show.

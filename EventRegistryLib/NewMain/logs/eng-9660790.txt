Reuters\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a staunch ally of Kyiv and a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, will succeed Jens Stoltenberg as NATO chief, Dutch national broadcaster NOS reported on Tuesday, after Hungary and Slovakia backed him.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, Stoltenberg neither confirmed nor denied the media report.\n\n\"With the announcement of (Hungarian) Prime Minister (Viktor) Orban, I think it's obvious that we are very close to a conclusion &mldr; to select the next secretary-general, and I think that's good news,\" he told reporters while praising Rutte.\n\n\"I think Mark is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Rutte has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support to Ukraine, stressing time and again what he said was the absolute need for a Russian battlefield defeat to secure peace in Europe.\n\nUnder his recent leadership, the Netherlands has ramped up defence spending above the 2 per cent threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nRutte's support for Ukraine is underscored by his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, as the Netherlands holds Russia accountable for the downing of passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 - which killed all 298 passengers and crew, 196 of them from the Netherlands.\n\nHours before the NOS report, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to NATO's top job.\n\nNATO makes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\nOrban drops opposition\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\"\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nStoltenberg's term will end on October 1, 10 years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass the opportunity to see a woman, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, take the helm of NATO for the first time - something several members had lobbied for.\n\nKallas, a candidate mainly touted by Eastern European countries, was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some Western member states.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands",

The summit is to mark NATO's 75th anniversary.\n\nAt talks in Budapest last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is due to step down in October, clinched a deal with Orban to ensure that Hungary would not block NATO's plans for Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg accepted that Hungary should not be obligated to provide personnel or funds for the collective effort, but Orban wanted to hear it from Rutte, too.\n\nNATO takes all of its decisions by consensus, giving any of the 32 member countries an effective veto, including on whether they should take part in any joint effort or operation.\n\nTaking to social media, Orban said it was important for Hungary to establish \"that this agreement can stand the test of time.\"\n\nHe posted Rutte's letter, dated June 18, a day after the two men had met in Brussels on the sidelines of a European Union summit.\n\nRutte wrote that \"in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General I will fully support this outcome of the talks between Jens Stoltenberg and you.\"\n\nIt was enough for Orban.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO. In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General,\" he posted on X.\n\nBudapest had also complained about unidentified remarks that Rutte had made about the Hungarian government three years ago and demanded an apology.\n\nRutte wrote that he \"took note\" that his past remarks \"caused dissatisfaction in Hungary. My priority in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General will be to maintain unity and treat all Allies with the same level of understanding and respect\".\n\nFollowing Hungary's announcement, Dutch national broadcaster NOS reported that Rutte will succeed Stoltenberg as NATO chief.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference alongside US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, Stoltenberg neither confirmed nor denied the media report.\n\n\"With the announcement of ... Orban, I think it's obvious that we are very close to a conclusion ... to select the next secretary-general, and I think that's good news,\" he told reporters, while praising Rutte.\n\n\"I think Mark is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO secretaries-general are responsible for chairing meetings and guiding sometimes delicate consultations among member countries to ensure that an organisation that operates on consensus can continue to function.\n\nRutte is far and away the preferred candidate of the majority of NATO allies, including the United States and Germany. Earlier this year, Turkey voiced opposition to Rutte's bid but lifted its objections in April.\n\nThe candidature of Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who is nearing the end of his second five-year term as head of state, remains a hurdle but officials and analysts believe it will not pose a major problem.\n\nStoltenberg is seen as a steady hand at NATO's helm for a decade and his mandate has been extended several times. Biden and his NATO counterparts had been due to name a successor when they met in Lithuania in July 2023, but no consensus could be found about a replacement.\n\n\"I mean it sincerely, you've been great. I just wish you'd extend your term another 10 years,\" Biden said as he met the former Norwegian prime minister at the White House on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

Romania was the only NATO country that had not yet endorsed Rutte, who needs the unanimous support of all 32 member states. Hungary and Slovakia endorsed Rutte after a European Union leaders' summit earlier this week.\n\nThe term of current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is due to end on October 1. In Washington on Tuesday, Stoltenberg said: \"I think it's obvious that we are very close to a conclusion in the alliance, for allies to select the next secretary general. And I think that's good news.\"\n\nRomania's opposition to Rutte's candidacy followed from its support for Iohannis, the country's head of state. But Romania's northwestern neighbour, Hungary, resisted Rutte in particular until this week.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban ended his opposition on Tuesday. \"Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary General,\" Orb\u00e1n said on X, alongside a copy of a letter from Rutte promising to respect an agreement between Orb\u00e1n and the current secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, that Hungary will not be required to contribute to Ukraine's war effort.\n\nRutte's letter, also dated Tuesday, noted that remarks he made in 2021 \"have caused dissatisfaction in Hungary. My priority in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General will be to maintain unity and treat all Allies with the same level of understanding and respect.\"\n\nEU leaders have accused Orban's government of undermining the rule of law in Hungary, and European Union courts have also ruled against Budapest.\n\nRutte and Orban met on Monday ahead of a dinner for EU leaders in Brussels, after which Rutte told reporters that he would soon be sending a letter to Orban. Rutte told members of the press that the Hungarian premier had not asked him to apologize, and that they were focused on the \"future.\"\n\nSlovakia's new president, Peter Pellegrini, also said in Brussels on Monday that his country would back Rutte, Slovakian national news agency TASR reported.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday: \"I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as Prime Minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon the Alliance will have decided on my successor, and that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "ommcomnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ommcom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Romania", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Romania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bucharest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bucharest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Hungary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ommcomnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/202406193176910.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 993, "textEnd": 1002}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow, read the report.\n\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Rutte has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support to Ukraine, stressing time and again what he said was the absolute need for a Russian battlefield defeat to secure peace in Europe.\n\nUnder his recent leadership, the Netherlands has ramped up defence spending above the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nRutte's support for Ukraine is underscored by his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, as the Netherlands holds Russia accountable for the downing of passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 - which killed all 298 passengers and crew, 196 of them from the Netherlands.\n\nHours before the NOS report, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to NATO's top job.\n\nNATO takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\nORBAN DROPS OPPOSITION\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\"\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nStoltenberg's term will end on October 1, 10 years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden, read the report.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass the opportunity to see a woman, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, take the helm of NATO for the first time - something several members had lobbied for.\n\nKallas, a candidate mainly touted by eastern European countries, was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states.\n\nBiden, Zelenskiy inch toward NATO with 10-year defense agreement", "source": {"uri": "ariananews.af", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ariana News"},

All of the military alliance's 32 members must approve a candidate for the four-year term.\n\nDutch RTL News on June 18 quoted unnamed sources as saying Budapest \"no longer opposes [Rutte's] candidacy\" after a meeting between Rutte and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on the sidelines of an EU leaders' meeting.\n\nOrban spokesman Zoltan Kovacs confirmed on the social network X that Orban and Rutte had met late on June 17 ahead of the EU summit to focus on \"bilateral and international issues.\"\n\nDutch outlet NOS quoted Orban's spokesman as saying the Hungarian prime minister and Rutte had a \"good conversation.\"\n\nThere has been no public word from Hungarian officials of any change of position.\n\nOrban had said earlier this month that he would end his opposition to Rutte's NATO candidacy if he apologized for recent criticism of his government in Budapest and permitted Hungary to exclude itself from the military alliance's higher aid plans to Ukraine.\n\nRutte said on June 17 that he remained \"cautiously optimistic about Hungary.\"\n\nThen on June 18, new Slovak President Peter Pellegrini said his country is prepared to support Rutte for the NATO top job.\n\n\"After a final discussion with Mark Rutte and consultation with the Slovak government, Slovakia can imagine Mark Rutte as the NATO chief,\" Reuters quoted Pellegrini telling a televised news briefing.\n\nSlovaks are among the most pro-Russian of EU and NATO members, and left-wing populist Prime Minister Robert Fico halted arms shipments to Ukraine after his appointment as prime minister in October.\n\nLike Orban, Fico has also publicly opposed Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO.\n\nPellegrini, who is regarded as a Fico ally, was sworn in to replace staunch Ukraine supporter Zuzana Caputova as president on June 15.\n\nOrban has been a staunch critic of sanctions and direct military assistance to Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago, and he has continued visits and other diplomatic overtures to Moscow despite Western calls for unity in the face of the Russian threat.\n\nHe and his national populist Fidesz party have also spearheaded anti-EU sentiment within and outside the bloc that seemingly contributed to right-wing gains in this month's elections for the European Parliament.\n\nStoltenberg traveled to Hungary on June 12 and emerged from a meeting with Orban saying Budapest had agreed not to block assistance and military aid to Ukraine, although it would exercise an opt-out.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis has sought the NATO leadership job for

FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\n\"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Russia.\n\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Rutte has been one of the driving forces behind European military support to Ukraine, stressing time and again what he said was the absolute need for a Russian battlefield defeat to secure peace on the continent.\n\nUnder his recent leadership, the Netherlands has ramped up defence spending above the two per cent threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Ukraine as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nRutte's support for Ukraine is underscored by his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, as the Netherlands holds Russia accountable for the downing of passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 - which killed all 298 passengers and crew.\n\nHours before the NOS report, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to the NATO military alliance's top job.\n\nNATO takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies.\n\nOnly Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with the Hungarian foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn country a \"crazy mission\".\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nStoltenberg's term will end on October 1, 10 years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nGet the latest news from

Hungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\nORBAN DROPS OPPOSITION \"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\" Orban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\" Turkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there. Stoltenberg's term will end on October 1, 10 years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia. Four countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass the opportunity to see a woman, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, take the helm of NATO for the first time - something several members had lobbied for. Kallas, a candidate mainly touted by eastern European countries, was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Rutte has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support to Ukraine, stressing time and again what he said was the absolute need for a Russian battlefield defeat to secure peace in Europe.\n\nUnder his recent leadership, the Netherlands has ramped up defence spending above the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nRutte's support for Ukraine is underscored by his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, as the Netherlands holds Russia accountable for the downing of passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 - which killed all 298 passengers and crew, 196 of them from the Netherlands.\n\nAlso Read: | Record number of NATO allies are hitting their defense spending target during war in Ukraine\n\nHours before the NOS report, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to NATO's top job.\n\nNATO takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies.

has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with the Hungarian foreign minister last month labelling

Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO.\"\n\nIn his letter, Rutte wrote that he would honour the deal cinched between Stoltenberg and Orban in Budapest last week, which confirmed that Hungary would be left out of NATO's support for Ukraine.\n\nRutte also mentioned that he had taken note of unidentified remarks he had made about Hungary in 2021 that had caused dissatisfaction within the Hungarian government.\n\nThe 57-year-old Dutch politician assured Orban in writing that Hungary's troops and funds would not be involved in NATO's support for Ukraine.\n\nDecisions in NATO are made via consensus between all members. Therefore, Hungary's veto on Rutte's leadership meant that he was blocked from ascending to the top position in the alliance.\n\nRutte has the approval of most NATO allies, including the US and Germany. Turkey previously opposed Rutte's bid but backtracked into approving him in April.\n\nAmong the 32 member states of the alliance, only Romania remains undeclared. The country's President Klaus Iohannis announced his own bid to become the next NATO secretary general in March, yet failed to drum up as much support as Rutte.\n\nRutte is known for being the longest-serving Dutch PM in history, having led four coalition governments since 2010.\n\nNATO is set to hold its annual summit in Washington in July, after which Rutte is expected to take over the helm of the alliance from Stoltenberg. The summit will focus on how to ensure long-term military support for Ukraine.\n\nAs head of NATO, Rutte would have to decide how to support Ukraine and deal with potential US president Donald Trump during his tenure. Trump is a well-known sceptic of the alliance and has threatened to quit unless other members boost their defence spending.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hungary", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense Ministries", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/51/47/18/1200x675_cmsv2_5e59ef1d-2eb1-52e8-87e8-6b24246027e1-8514718.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

I think that's good news. I think that Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate.\"\n\nRutte said on June 17 that he remained \"cautiously optimistic about Hungary.\"\n\nEarlier on June 18, new Slovak President Peter Pellegrini said his country was prepared to support Rutte for the NATO top job.\n\n\"After a final discussion with Mark Rutte and consultation with the Slovak government, Slovakia can imagine Mark Rutte as the NATO chief,\" Reuters quoted Pellegrini as telling a televised news briefing.\n\nRutte is now on the verge of the unanimous support he needs to be chosen for the position, with only Romania undeclared among the military alliance's 32 members to approve the Dutch politician for a four-year term.\n\nSlovaks are among the most pro-Russian of EU and NATO members, and left-wing populist Prime Minister Robert Fico halted arms shipments to Ukraine after his appointment as prime minister in October.\n\nLike Orban, Fico has also publicly opposed Ukraine's eventual membership in NATO.\n\nPellegrini, who is regarded as a Fico ally, was sworn in to replace staunch Ukraine supporter Zuzana Caputova as president on June 15.\n\nOrban has been a staunch critic of sanctions and direct military assistance to Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago, and he has continued visits and other diplomatic overtures to Moscow despite Western calls for unity in the face of the Russian threat.\n\nHe and his national populist Fidesz party have also spearheaded anti-EU sentiment within and outside the bloc that seemingly contributed to right-wing gains in this month's elections for the European Parliament.\n\nStoltenberg traveled to Hungary on June 12 and emerged from a meeting with Orban saying Budapest had agreed not to block assistance and military aid to Ukraine, although it would exercise an opt-out.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis has sought the NATO leadership job for himself.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"},

Rutte told members of the press that the Hungarian premier had not asked him to apologize, and that they were focused on the \"future.\"\n\nSlovakia's new president, Peter Pellegrini, also said in Brussels on Monday that his country would back Rutte, Slovakian national news agency TASR reported.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday: \"I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate.

Rutte, who has been the leader of the Netherlands since 2010, remains prime minister in the country's transitional government, and a diplomat who requested anonymity, in line with protocol, said the current NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, was for now expected to stay until his term ends in October.\n\nRutte has increasingly echoed a main NATO message that supporting Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia is vital for preserving democracy and national sovereignty across the alliance.\n\n\"This war is not simply about defending the freedom of the Ukrainian people; it is also about protecting the freedom and security of the Netherlands,\" Rutte is quoted as saying at the top of his government's website. \"So we will not abandon those most in need.\"\n\nStill, Rutte is not seen as unwilling to deal with Russia or with Moscow's few allies in NATO, as had been the case with some candidates from Eastern Europe or the Baltic states who also had expressed interest in the top job.\n\n\"It is a consensus organization, so you have 32 allies that you need to bring on board,\" said Camille Grand, a former NATO assistant secretary general who is now at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"If you're perceived as leaning toward one particular geography of the alliance, or too dovish or too hawkish, then it makes things complicated.\n\n\"There was a concern that it was important to have someone who is perceived as in the middle ground of the alliance, rather than on the edges of the debate,\" Grand said. \"So he was ticking all the boxes.\"\n\nGrand knew and worked with Rutte when they overlapped at NATO headquarters in Brussels. \"He was always pretty mainstream in the room,\" Grand said. \"He was never the guy who was difficult on anything, but always very supportive of NATO, sometimes even to the point of criticizing his peers when they were not loyal enough.\"\n\nRutte's criticism of Hungary in 2021 was seen as almost costing him the top NATO job.\n\nHungary is both a member of NATO and of the European Union, and its leader, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has exasperated officials in both organizations for imposing some authoritarian policies and maintaining relations with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. In 2021, Orban's government restricted LGBTQ+ content in the media and schools, eliciting \"deep concern\" from EU leaders and prompting Rutte to declare that Hungary \"has no business being in the European Union anymore.\"\n\nThat set off three years of acrimony between the two men and led to suggestions by Orban that he would not support Rutte's candidacy as the NATO chief, whose election requires unanimous consent within the alliance. But Orban backed down last week as part of an agreement that Hungary would not provide or otherwise support NATO efforts to continue sending military aid to Ukraine for the duration of the war.\n\nIn a letter to Orban on Tuesday, Rutte said he would respect that agreement \"in a possible future capacity as NATO secretary general.\"\n\nBut Rutte stopped just short of apologizing for his remarks about Hungary.\n\n\"I also took note that some remarks I made in 2021 as prime minister of the Netherlands have caused dissatisfaction in Hungary,\" Rutte wrote in the letter, dated Tuesday. \"My priority in a possible future capacity as NATO secretary general will be to maintain unity and treat allies with the same level of understanding and respect.\"\n\nNATO allies who backed Rutte's bid have sought to lock down support before the July meeting in Washington. Iohannis, the Romanian president, dropped out of the running after Orban's concession made it clear that Rutte's bid had widespread support. On Thursday, Iohannis endorsed Rutte and announced that Romania would send one of its urgently needed Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine.\n\nRutte announced last July that he would not seek reelection in the Netherlands after his government was split over the issue of Dutch asylum for migrants and refugees.\n\nIn October, he told Dutch radio that he found the job of NATO's civilian chief \"very interesting,\" and by February, he had secured the backing of the United States and of European powers.\n\nRutte is not married, lives in the same house in The Hague that he bought as a student with friends, and often rides his bike to work.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Peter Pellegrini had endorsed Rutte in return for help from the Dutch in securing air defence equipment.\n\nNATO diplomats said they expect Romania's Iohannis to announce soon that he was withdrawing from the race, though there was still no formal word from Bucharest.\n\nRutte would likely assume office when Stoltenberg's term ends on October 1.\n\nIn the letter posted by Orban, Rutte also \"took note\" of critical remarks he made in 2021 of Orban's populist right-wing government that \"have caused dissatisfaction in Hungary\".\n\nHe pledged to \"maintain unity and treat all allies with the

The mandate of the current secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, expires on October 1. His replacement must have the unanimous support of all the bloc's members.\n\nBudapest previously threatened to veto Rutte's appointment due to comments he made regarding Hungary's domestic policies. In 2021, Rutte denounced Orban's anti-LGBT legislation, saying Hungary \"has no business being in the European Union anymore.\" He added at the time that \"the long-term aim\" was to \"bring Hungary to its knees\" on the issue.\n\nEarlier this year, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Budapest \"certainly couldn't support the election of a person... who previously wanted to force Hungary on its knees.\"\n\nViktor Orban reportedly said earlier this month he would drop his objections if Rutte apologized for his comments.\n\nThe Hungarian leader has also been a vocal critic of the bloc's stance on Ukraine and of the policy of sending military aid to the country to help it fight Russia. In May, he threatened to \"redefine\" Hungary's NATO membership. Last week Stoltenberg assured Orban that Hungary could opt out of the bloc's Ukraine-related policies and that it would not be forced to participate in military action outside NATO territory.\n\nOn Monday, Rutte and Orban met at an EU summit in Brussels, after which the Dutch politician said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that Hungary would drop opposition to his appointment, AFP reported.\n\nThe two men talked on the sidelines of an EU leaders dinner on Monday night, according to Financial Times.\n\nOrban did not seek an apology, according to the AFP account of the meeting.

The mandate of the current secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, expires on October 1. His replacement must have the unanimous support of all the bloc's members.\n\nBudapest previously threatened to veto Rutte's appointment due to comments he made regarding Hungary's domestic policies. In 2021, Rutte denounced Orban's anti-LGBT legislation, saying Hungary \"has no business being in the European Union anymore.\" He added at the time that \"the long-term aim\" was to \"bring Hungary to its knees\" on the issue.\n\nEarlier this year, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Budapest \"certainly couldn't support the election of a person... who previously wanted to force Hungary on its knees.\"\n\nViktor Orban reportedly said earlier this month he would drop his objections if Rutte apologized for his comments.\n\nThe Hungarian leader has also been a vocal critic of the bloc's stance on Ukraine and of the policy of sending military aid to the country to help it fight Russia.

Caputova as president on June 15.\n\nOrban has been a staunch critic of sanctions and direct military assistance to Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine two years ago, and he has continued visits and other diplomatic overtures to Moscow despite Western calls for unity in the face of the Russian threat.\n\nHe and his national populist Fidesz party have also spearheaded anti-EU sentiment within and outside the bloc that seemingly contributed to right-wing gains in this month's elections for the European Parliament.\n\nStoltenberg traveled to Hungary on June 12 and emerged from a meeting with Orban saying Budapest had agreed not to block assistance and military aid to Ukraine, although it would exercise an opt-out.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis has sought the NATO leadership job for

Orban had already secured the assurance from current NATO chief Stoltenberg last week but Rutte has agreed to honour it.\n\nUnder the compromise deal, Budapest would \"not block\" plans for the alliance to play a bigger role in arms shipments to the Kyiv Government, but Hungary would not have to contribute to the initiative.\n\n\"Our next step this week was to ensure that this agreement can stand the test of time,\" Orban posted, along with a photo of him and Rutte shaking hands and a letter signed by Rutte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the letter posted by Orban, Rutte also \"took note\" of critical remarks he made in 2021 of Orban's populist right-wing government that \"have caused dissatisfaction in Hungary\".\n\nHe pledged to \"maintain unity and treat all allies with the same level of understanding and respect\".\n\nMedia reports in Slovakia, which had been sitting on the fence on Rutte's appointment, said yesterday that President Peter Pellegrini had endorsed Rutte in return for help from the Dutch in securing air defence equipment.\n\nIt is now believed that Romania's Iohannis will announce shortly that he is ending his candidacy.\n\nThe way will then be clear for Rutte to assume office when Stoltenberg's term ends on October 1.\n\nStoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, has been NATO's secretary general since 2014. His tenure has been extended on a number of occasions when the alliance failed to find a successor.\n\nThe Norwegian put a stop to that this year when he said he no longer wanted to serve. While there was wide speculation on Stoltenberg's successor Rutte made the running early as he was supported by the US, UK, Germany and France.\n\nRutte is a centre-right politician, who was known as a social studies lecturer. He served as prime minister of the Netherlands for 14 years. He is known at home as \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to avoid leadership challenges.\n\nWith reporting from AFP.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nTo NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Ukraine's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time he will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Russia.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nAlongside Ukraine, the biggest challenge will be \"to ensure that defence spending remains high in Europe... given the world we're living in,\" Rutte said.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of gross domestic product on defence.\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine after Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, which a tribunal found was carried out by Russia-backed fighters.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType":

The latest development came as Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, dropped his opposition to Rutte's candidacy. Earlier on Tuesday, the outgoing Dutch prime minister gave written guarantees that he would not force the country to take part in the military alliance's new plans to provide support to Ukraine.\n\nRutte's assurances, contained in a letter to Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n, remove a major obstacle to him becoming the next NATO secretary-general -- the organization's top civilian official.\n\nIt could also allow NATO to put on a major show of unity and demonstrate solidarity with war-ravaged Ukraine when US President Joe Biden and his counterparts meet in Washington on July 9-11. The summit is to mark NATO's 75th anniversary.\n\nAt talks in Budapest last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is due to step down in October, clinched a deal with Orb\u00e1n to ensure that Hungary would not block NATO's plans for Ukraine. Stoltenberg accepted that Hungary should not be obligated to provide personnel or funds for the collective effort, but Orb\u00e1n wanted to hear it from Rutte too. NATO takes all of its decisions by consensus, giving any of the 32 member countries an effective veto, including on whether they should take part in any joint effort or operation.\n\nTaking to social media, Orb\u00e1n said it was important for Hungary to establish \"that this agreement can stand the test of time.\" He posted Rutte's letter, dated June 18, a day after the two men had met in Brussels on the sidelines of a European Union summit.\n\nRutte wrote that \"in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General I will fully support this outcome of the talks between Jens Stoltenberg and you.\" It was enough for Orb\u00e1n. \"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO. In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General,\" he posted on X. Budapest had also complained about unidentified remarks that Rutte had made about the Hungarian government three years ago and demanded an apology.\n\nRutte wrote that he \"took note\" that his past remarks \"caused dissatisfaction in Hungary. My priority in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General will be to maintain unity and treat all Allies with the same level of understanding and respect.\"\n\nNATO secretaries-general are responsible for chairing meetings and guiding sometimes delicate consultations among member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. Rutte is far and away the preferred candidate of the majority of NATO allies, including big members like the United States and Germany. Earlier this year, Turkey voiced opposition to Rutte's bid but lifted its objections in April.\n\nStoltenberg is seen as a steady hand at NATO's helm for a decade and his mandate has been extended several times.

'He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague.'\n\nTrump's return could pose one major challenge - to NATO's east, Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhile Donald Trump's return could pose one major challenge, to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow - if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence - a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nRead More MARK GALEOTTI: Putin's visit to Kim Jong Un's North Korea marks a line in the sand.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\nDubbed 'Teflon Mark' for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of the Second World War to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion - leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the

Stoltenberg described Rutte as a strong candidate with extensive experience, garnering support from Hungary and Slovakia. Only Romania remains opposed, as the alliance nears a consensus decision, expected to be finalized soon.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg described Mark Rutte on Tuesday as a very strong candidate to replace him after the departing Dutch prime minister won the support of Hungary and Slovakia.\n\nThe defence alliance takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still opposed to Rutte's candidacy. Dutch news outlet NOS quoted sources close to the matter as saying Rutte would succeed Stoltenberg, who steps down in October after nearly a decade at the helm. Reuters could not immediately obtain a comment from NATO on the news report.\n\nStoltenberg said the decision-making process was very close to a conclusion. \"I think it's obvious that we're very close to a conclusion in the alliance for allies to select the next Secretary General. And I think that's good news,\" he told a press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington.\n\n\"I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as prime minister, he is a close friend and colleague and I therefore strongly believe that very soon the alliance will have decided on my successor and that will be good for all of us, for NATO. And also for me.\" Hungary's backing followed a meeting Prime Minister Viktor Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform. \"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nNATO's next chief will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/01_12_2023_09_33_55_8134116.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The summit is to mark NATO's 75th anniversary.\n\nAt talks in Budapest last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is due to step down in October, clinched a deal with Orb\u00e1n to ensure that Hungary would not block NATO's plans for Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg accepted that Hungary should not be obligated to provide personnel or funds for the collective effort, but Orb\u00e1n wanted to hear it from Rutte too.\n\nNATO takes all of its decisions by consensus, giving any of the 32 member countries an effective veto, including on whether they should take part in any joint effort or operation.\n\nTaking to social media, Orb\u00e1n said it was important for Hungary to establish \"that this agreement can stand the test of time.\" He posted Rutte's letter, dated June 18, a day after the two men had met in Brussels on the sidelines of a European Union summit.\n\nRutte wrote that \"in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General I will fully support this outcome of the talks between Jens Stoltenberg and you.\"\n\nIt was enough for Orb\u00e1n. \"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should be become the next Secretary-General of NATO. In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General,\" he posted on the social media platform X.\n\nBudapest had also complained about unidentified remarks that Rutte had made about the Hungarian government three years ago and demanded an apology.\n\nRutte wrote that he \"took note\" that his past remarks \"caused dissatisfaction in Hungary. My priority in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General will be to maintain unity and treat all Allies with the same level of understanding and respect.\"\n\nNATO secretaries-general are responsible for chairing meetings and guiding sometimes delicate consultations among member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function.\n\nRutte is far and away the preferred candidate of the majority of NATO allies, including big members like the United States and Germany. Earlier this year, Turkey voiced opposition to Rutte's bid but lifted its objections in April.\n\nThe last hurdle remains the candidature of Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who is nearing the end of his second five-year term as head of state, but officials and analysts believe it will not pose a major problem.\n\nStoltenberg is seen as a steady hand at NATO's helm for a decade and his mandate has been extended several times. Biden and his NATO counterparts had been due to name a successor when they met in Lithuania in July 2023, but no consensus could be found about a replacement.\n\n\"I mean it sincerely, you've been great. I just wish you'd extend your term another 10 years,\" Biden said as he met the former Norwegian prime minister at the White House on Monday.\n\nPrime Minister of Netherlands Mark Rutte attends the annual Kultaranta Talks -debate session on foreign and security policy at the Presidential Palace, in Helsinki, Finland, Thursday, June 13, 2024.

Over the course of more than a dozen years at the top of Dutch politics, Mark Rutte got to know a thing or two about finding consensus [...]\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Over the course of more than a dozen years at the top of Dutch politics, Mark Rutte got to know a thing or two about finding consensus among fractious coalition partners. Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"It took a very long time. It's a complicated process, but it's an honor that it appears to have happened,\" Rutte told reporters in The Hague before riding his bicycle away from work.\n\nA former NATO spokesperson said Rutte was a good fit for the job.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nFrom history scholar to business manager to politics\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nOn Thursday, he posed -- in jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses -- for selfies with people outside his office while sitting on his bicycle.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nHe said the war on Europe's eastern flank was one of the reasons for seeking the job as NATO chief.\n\n\"With everything that happened in Ukraine and the instability in the world and a number of people who thought I could maybe do it, you can't just push that to one side,\" he said. \"And it is, of course, an unbelievably interesting job.\"\n\nRutte's political career hasn't been all smooth sailing\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nExperience on the international political stage\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU's efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nTo NATO's east, Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Ukraine's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time he will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Russia.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence - a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nAlongside Ukraine, the biggest challenge will be \"to ensure that defence spending remains high in Europe... given the world we're living in,\" Rutte said.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defence.\n\nWith reporting from \u00a9 AFP 2024\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defense -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab

It is providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nFormer Norwegian Prime Minister Stoltenberg's term at the helm of NATO will end on October 1. He took office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.\n\nStoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office: Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance would pass up the opportunity to appoint its first female secretary-general - something multiple member states had said they were eager to do.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was widely considered a contender for the role with strong support from Eastern European countries. But she was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some Western member states.\n\nKallas is now the leading candidate to be the next European Union foreign policy chief, according to diplomats.\n\nIohannis, whose second term as Romanian president ends this year, has repeatedly said Eastern European states need better representation in Euro-Atlantic leadership roles.\n\nRomania, a member of both NATO and the EU, has raised defence spending to 2.5 percent of its GDP in response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said.\n\n\"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nHours before, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Mr Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to NATO's top job.\n\nNATO takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Mr Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Mr Orban had with Mr Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\nOrban drops opposition\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Mr Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nMr Orban had earlier opposed Mr Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Mr Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission\".\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Mr Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier today.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nMr Stoltenberg's term will end on 1 October, ten years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Mr Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Mr Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Stoltenberg is due to step down in October.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General,\" added Orban.\n\nHis comments led to Stoltenberg later revealing, during a joint press conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that a decision regarding his replacement is on the way.\n\n\"Normally I don't say anything about my successor because it's not for me to select my successor, but with the announcement by Prime Minister Orban today, I think it's obvious that we are very close to a conclusion in the alliance to select the next Secretary General,\" he said.\n\n\"I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as Prime Minister, is a close friend and colleague and I therefore strongly believe that very soon the alliance will have decided on my successor and that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nAsked about the timing of the alliance member vote on a new Secretary General, a NATO spokesperson referred Breaking Defense to Stoltenberg's latest comments in the US.\n\nAll 32 allies are required to reach a consensus on one candidate, who will serve an initial four year term and then can have their term extended, as happened to Stoltenberg three times. He has led the alliance since 2014, a time period which saw Europe awaken to the Russian threat after Moscow's invasion of Crimea and eventually the rest of Ukraine, along with the tumultuous Trump years. Although Stoltenberg had actually accepted another job in 2023, NATO leadership extended him one more time last July, in part because there was no clear successor in place.\n\nWith Orban's support, few issues appear to stand in the way of Rutte succeeding Stoltenberg. Slovakia, another potential bureaucratic trouble spot due to its relative friendliness with Russia, has finally signaled its support. Local Slovakian media reports on Tuesday said President Peter Pellegrini had decided to back Rutte in return for Dutch support regarding the acquisition of air defense weapons.\n\nThe last of Rutte's competitors for the post, Romania's President Klaus Iohannis, is likely to withdraw from the contest, based on the views of NATO diplomats, according to France's Le Monde newspaper.\n\nRutte is a center-right lawmaker who has led the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) for 18 years and headed four Dutch governments. In a shock announcement last year, he decided against standing for re-election after a fallout on immigration policy led to a collapse of his coalition government.\n\nHe was once a human resources manager at British consumer giant Unilever, before his political career blossomed. He served as minister for social affairs and employment, moving on to minister of education, culture and science before rising to power as the VVD leader in 2010.\n\nIn a Guardian profile of Rutte, analysts described him as a \"skillful, savvy operator with a talent for building and maintaining unlikely alliances,\" and he has often been nicknamed \"Teflon Mark\" due to a reputation for avoiding political scandal.\n\nThough Rutte's tender will not begin until after the NATO Summit in Washington next month, the alliance's premiere event is set to focus on three major themes, according to Stoltenberg; deterrence and defense, Ukraine, and global partnerships, including a heavy emphasis on the Indo-Pacific.\n\nAs Ukraine continues to suffer attacks from Russia, allies are also expected to discuss additional weapons supplies at the Summit, but Stoltenberg said the alliance has not changed position on the timing of a possible invite to Ukraine to join the alliance.\n\n\"We will continue to bring Ukraine ever closer to NATO membership,\" he said earlier this week. \"So that when the time is right, Ukraine can join without delay.\"", "source": {"uri":

Only Romania had still been officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nRutte, 57, has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support for Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, and says defeat on the battlefield for Moscow is vital to secure peace in Europe.\n\nHis view is heavily influenced by the downing of an airliner over Ukraine in 2014, which the Netherlands blames on Russia, and in which 196 of the 298 victims were Dutch. NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia, he says.\n\n\"He won't stop at Ukraine, if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It's about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nAfter the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nNATO members had been due to name a successor to Jens Stoltenberg when they met in Lithuania in July 2023, but no consensus could be found about a replacement. U.S. President Joe Biden will host NATO members July 9-11 in Washington, D.C., with the alliance's 75th anniversary to be hailed.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics.\n\nRutte had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics, but he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands increased defence spending to more than the two per cent threshold of GDP desired of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv, and invested heavily in its own military.\n\nIn his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister of Netherlands when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition.\n\nHis path to replace Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became more certain after Hungary and Slovakia indicated on Tuesday that they would back his nomination.\n\nStoltenberg said this week Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members. Some members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish toward Russia.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots.\n\nEven while warning of the threat posed by Putin, Rutte has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems.\n\n\"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a parliamentary debate in April.\n\nLISTEN | The road ahead for NATO at the 75-year mark:\n\nRutte's challenges could include the possible return of Donald Trump as U.S. president, which has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nRutte said at the Munich Security Conference in February that NATO needs to \"work with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"We should stop moaning and whining and nagging about Trump,\" he said.\n\nRomania, in announcing its backing of Rutte, said it would also donate one of its two operational Patriot missile systems to Ukraine on condition that allies replace it with a similar air defence system.\n\nThe donation was made \"considering the significant deterioration of Ukraine's security situation following constant and massive attacks by Russia on civilians and civilian infrastructure,\" Bucharest's Supreme Defence Council (CSAT) said in a statement.\n\nRomania has raised defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nCanada has been criticized for lagging on its commitment to the two per cent guidance. Foreign Affairs Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly told CBC's Power & Politics last week that the government has a plan to reach that level of defence spending in the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri":

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"It took a very long time. It's a complicated process, but it's an honor that it appears to have happened,\" Rutte told reporters in The Hague before riding his bicycle away from work.\n\nA former NATO spokesperson said Rutte was a good fit for the job.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nFrom history scholar to business manager to politics\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nOn Thursday, he posed -- in jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses -- for selfies with people outside his office while sitting on his bicycle.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nHe said the war on Europe's eastern flank was one of the reasons for seeking the job as NATO chief.\n\n\"With everything that happened in Ukraine and the instability in the world and a number of people who thought I could maybe do it, you can't just push that to one side,\" he said. \"And it is, of course, an unbelievably interesting job.\"\n\nRutte's political career hasn't been all smooth sailing\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nExperience on the international political stage\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU's efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed Crimea.", "source":

He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nHours before, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to NATO's top job.\n\nNATO takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\nORBAN DROPS OPPOSITION\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\"\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nStoltenberg's term will end on October 1, 10 years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\n(Reporting by Sabine Siebold, Charlotte Van Campenhout Humeyra Pamuk, Anthony Deutsch, Benoit Van Overstraeten, Boldizsar Gyori, Anita

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, which a tribunal found was carried out by Russia-backed fighters.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType":

Reuters\n\nDutch's outgoing prime minister Mark Rutte will be the next chief of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nThis comes after Romania's president withdrew from the race.\n\nIn office since 2010, the 57-year-old Rutte is the country's longest-serving prime minister.\n\nRutte has served as prime minister of the Netherlands four times - at the head of multiple coalition governments.\n\nBut what do we know about Rutte? What can we expect when he takes over as NATO chief?\n\nRutte went to the Maerlant Lyceum school from 1979 until 1985 where he specialised in the arts.\n\nRutte got his MA degree from the prestigious Leiden University.\n\nRutte worked as a manager for Unilever before taking the plunge into politics.\n\nHe began his political career in 2002 as part of the Cabinet of then prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende.\n\nRutte was then deputy minister in the Social Affairs and Employment Ministry under Balkenende from 2002 to 2004.\n\nHe was also a member of the Dutch House of Representatives in 2003.\n\nRutte served as State Secretary for Higher Education and Science in the Education, Culture and Science Ministry from 2004 to 2006.\n\nRise to power\n\nIn 2006, Rutte began his ascent to the top of Dutch politics when he became the leader of the center-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).\n\nRutte won the 2010 general election and never looked back.\n\nArguably the biggest test of Rutte's leadership came in 2014 - when 196 Dutch nationals were killed when a missile shot down a passenger jet over Ukraine.\n\nInvestigators said the missile was supplied by Moscow.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Rutte was nicknamed \"Teflon Mark\" due to his ability to survive scandals.\n\nHe became prime minister for the fourth time in 2022 - a year after Rutte and his entire Cabinet resigned to accept political responsibility for a scandal involving the nation's tax office that wrongly labeled as fraudsters thousands of parents who claimed childcare benefits.\n\nRutte also has a reputation as a consensus builder.\n\nHis fourth coalition government - comprising the conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, together with the centrist, pro-European D66, the center-right Christian Democratic Appeal and centrist Christian Union - was made up of the same four parties that quit to end his third term.\n\nRutte resigned in July 2023 after the issue of reining in migration that has troubled countries across Europe for years brought down his government.\n\nRutte initially said he would leave politics.\n\n\"In the past few days, people have speculated about what motivates me, and the only answer is: the Netherlands. My position is completely subservient to the country. Yesterday morning I took the decision that I will no longer be available to head the VVD list. When a new government takes over, I shall leave politics,\" he was quoted as saying by The Guardian.\n\nInterestingly, Rutte in 2023 said he was not interested in the job of NATO chief.\n\nThough Rutte hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics, he later cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post.\n\nRutte is a fierce advocate of Ukraine and a long-time critic of Vladimir Putin.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands increased defence spending to more than the two per cent threshold of GDP desired of NATO members.\n\nRutte believes NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia.\n\nAddressing the UN in September 2022, months after Russia's invasion, Rutte said, \"He won't stop at Ukraine, if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It's about upholding the international rule of law.\"\n\nIn his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte's government had taken prominent role in supporting Ukraine, pledging billions of euros and leading the push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte has also praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\n\"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nZelenskyy had welcomed the 'historic' announcement and praised Rutte for making the Netherlands the first country to offer the planes.\n\nRutte taking charge of NATO allows it to put on a show of unity and demonstrate solidarity with war-ravaged Ukraine when US President Joe Biden and his counterparts meet in Washington in July to mark NATO's 75th birthday.\n\nRutte has for months been the preferred candidate of the majority of NATO allies, including big members like the United States and Germany.\n\nIn office for a decade, outgoing Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has been a steady hand at NATO's helm and has proved difficult to replace.\n\nEven while warning of the threat posed by Putin, Rutte has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems.\n\n\"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a parliamentary debate in April.\n\nThe Trump challenge\n\nRutte's challenges could include the possible return of Donald Trump as US president, which has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question US willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nRutte, who has forged good relationships with various British and US leaders, is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with Donald Trump.\n\nRutte said at the Munich Security Conference in February that NATO needs to \"work with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"We should stop moaning and whining and nagging about Trump,\" he said.\n\nHungary lifted its veto on Rutte's candidacy after the long-serving Dutch prime minister gave written guarantees that he would not force Budapest to take part in the military alliance's new plans to provide support to Ukraine should he be appointed.\n\n\"We reached an important agreement with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. We agreed that no Hungarian personnel will take part in the activities of NATO in Ukraine and no Hungarian funds will be used to support them,\" Orban said as per The Week.\n\n\"Our next step this week was to ensure that this agreement can stand the test of time. After yesterday's meeting in Brussels, PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO&mldr;In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General,\" he added.\n\nNATO makes all of its decisions by consensus, giving any of the 32 member countries an effective veto, including on whether they should take part in any joint effort or operation.\n\nTurkey had also voiced opposition to Rutte's bid but lifted its objections in April.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members.\n\nSome members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Iohannis said during a meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council that he had notified NATO allies that he had withdrawn his candidacy.\n\nRutte will assume his new powers on Oct. 2, just over a month before the U.S. elections that will determine the fate of the military alliance.\n\nRutte's path to the post of NATO secretary general has been a long one. He has been campaigning since last November. Rutte has been criticized for not doing enough to mobilize support from Eastern European countries, which questioned his support for Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline project until 2014. Rutte has also consistently failed to bring Dutch defense spending to the NATO target of 2 percent of GDP throughout his 14-year tenure as prime minister of the EU's fifth-largest economy.

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

Allies had hoped to select the next head of the military alliance before a NATO leaders summit in Washington next month.\n\nThe change of NATO leader comes at a critical moment in the alliance's 75th year and as Russia's war with Ukraine drags on. The NATO chief will have to continue corralling allies' support for Ukraine in defending itself against Russia, while also preventing any escalation between Moscow and the military alliance.\n\nThat job may be made more challenging if Donald Trump returns to the White House after US elections in November. Rutte has been seen as the best candidate to manage the former US President, who had fraught ties with his NATO counterparts in his first term, as he repeatedly pressed European allies to increase their defense budgets and questioned the value of remaining part of the alliance.\n\nTrump was right to complain about the shortfall in defense spending from his European allies, Rutte said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in January, adding that \"we have to dance with whoever is on the dance floor,\" when asked about a potential Trump victory.\n\nRutte's path was cleared when Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban backed him after receiving a written pledge to respect a deal made with Stoltenberg, giving Budapest an opt-out from the alliance's commitments to Ukraine. Slovakia also backed Rutte earlier this week, in exchange for assurances that NATO would protect Slovak airspace.\n\nWhile Rutte had early backing from a majority of the alliance, Romania's surprise move in March to put Iohannis forward delayed the process, even as many officials said his candidacy came too late to dent support for Rutte.\n\nRutte is stepping down as the Netherlands' longest serving leader now that a new coalition government has been agreed, with Dick Schoof, a former head of the Dutch intelligence service, due to replace him. The Dutch leader announced his departure last year, after his government collapsed over an internal row on migration policy.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and Latvian Foreign Minister Krisjanis Karins both expressed interest in the NATO role last year, but Rutte emerged as the favorite due to broad support from countries like the US, France and Germany.\n\n--With assistance from Lina Grau, Ellen Milligan, Natalia Drozdiak, Cagan Koc and Marton Kasnyik.\n\n(Updates with statement in second paragraph, background throughout.)", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType":

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\n- 'Teflon Mark' -\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.\n\nbur-del/ec/jj\n\nMore from this section\n\nDovenmuehle's Above Average Residential Mortgage Loan Primary Servicer Ranking Affirmed by S&P Global Rankings\n\nLatinx Festival on L.

Rutte met with Orban in Brussels on 17 June on the sidelines of an informal meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\n'Teflon Mark'\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news",

So, why did he step down?\n\nRutte's liberal-conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) had deemed his approach on asylum-seekers too lenient, causing his fragile four-party coalition government to collapse. This was followed by snap elections, won by far-right populist Geert Wilders. Rutte had been unable to prevent this shift toward the right, and it arguably marked the biggest defeat of his political career.\n\nSince then he has remained in office for nearly a year, in a caretaking role as Wilders' complicated government talks have dragged on.\n\nBy October 2023, the 57-year-old Rutte had seemingly forgotten all about his vow to retire from politics, and instead signaled his interest in succeeding NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, whose term ends in October. For months, Rutte ran a discreet one-man campaign in an effort to win over various heads of state and government, whom he already knew from years of working with various international bodies. The trained historian is a staunch supporter of Ukraine and was quickly able to secure US backing for his campaign, soon followed by most other NATO member states.\n\nWinning over Hungary's right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, with whom he is not on the best of terms, took a bit longer. Rutte had to promise Orban that Hungary would never have to participate in NATO activities supporting Ukraine outside of NATO territory as long as Rutte leads the alliance. Orban, who keeps friendly ties with Russia, also ruled out arms deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nRutte's liberal politics and Orban's illiberal outlook often put them at loggerheads in their dealings within the EU. When Hungary adopted an anti-LGBTQ+ law in 2021, Rutte told Orban he was free to leave the bloc if he disagreed with its policies.\n\nThat said, Rutte is known for his good humor and wit. As prime minister, he would cycle from his modest home to his office. Sometimes, one could witness his musical talent when he sat down to play piano at The Hague Central station.\n\nAs NATO secretary-general, Rutte will probably have to become a bit more serious and diplomatic. His main task, after all, will be to balance out the conflicting interests of NATO's 32 members so it can speak with one united voice. His predecessor, Norway's Jens Stoltenberg, was a stoic master of this balancing act. \"Stick to your message\" was his key credo for ensuring communicative success.\n\n\"True leadership requires the ability to listen and understand different perspectives,\" Rutte once said in a speech. This attitude may serve him well as NATO head. After all, Rutte is \"a successful crisis manager,\" according to journalist Sheila Sitalsin, a columnist for the Dutch daily Volkskrant, who has written a biography of the Dutch prime minister.\n\nFor a long time, many Dutch citizens were satisfied with the political stability that Rutte ensured during the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, despite shifting government majorities. He also weathered minor scandals well -- so much so that one of his nicknames in the Netherlands became \"Teflon Rutte.\"\n\nHe should be prepared for the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House and setting his sights on NATO once more. Rutte and Trump developed a surprisingly positive relationship during Trump's his first term as US president, with Trump even calling Rutte a friend. But Rutte, as the leader of a historic trading nation, fiercely opposed Trump's protectionist economic policy.\n\nUnlike Trump, Rutte favored sending weapons to Ukraine, even providing Dutch howitzers and fighter planes. The Dutch army itself, however, was underfunded during Rutte's 13 years in power. Only this year, for the first time ever, will the Netherlands spend 2% of its GDP on defense, in line with NATO spending targets.\n\nRutte has been critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin for years. After all, Russia was probably at least partly responsible for the downing of flight MH-17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014. The Malaysia Airlines plane had been on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Almost 300 people died, most of them Dutch nationals, when the plane crashed.\n\nIn the EU, Rutte is seen as \"Mr. No\", one EU diplomat told DW. That is because he rejects the kinds of ambitious reform plans and ideas that French President Emmanuel Macron floats. Rutte does, however, get on well with Germany's reserved Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He is also on good terms with Italy's right-wing populist Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Together, Rutte and Meloni have suggested processing asylum applications outside the EU in third-party states.\n\nRutte's approach to politics has shades of Houdini, writes Sitalsing. Like the famous escape artist, Rutte has been able to extract himself from almost any crisis. It's a skill that might come in useful as NATO secretary-general.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"It took a very long time. It's a complicated process, but it's an honor that it appears to have happened,\" Rutte told reporters in The Hague before riding his bicycle away from work.\n\nA former NATO spokesperson said Rutte was a good fit for the job.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nOn Thursday, he posed -- in jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses -- for selfies with people outside his office while sitting on his bicycle.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nHe said the war on Europe's eastern flank was one of the reasons for seeking the job as NATO chief.\n\n\"With everything that happened in Ukraine and the instability in the world and a number of people who thought I could maybe do it, you can't just push that to one side,\" he said. \"And it is, of course, an unbelievably interesting job.\"\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU's efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.\n\nFor more NATO news from the AP: https://apnews.com/hub/nato", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news",

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\n- 'Teflon Mark' -\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nRomania's President Klaus Iohannis dropped out as the only other contender for the NATO job\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The summit is to mark NATO's 75th anniversary.\n\nAt talks in Budapest last week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is due to step down in October, clinched a deal with Orb\u00e1n to ensure that Hungary would not block NATO's plans for Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg accepted that Hungary should not be obligated to provide personnel or funds for the collective effort, but Orb\u00e1n wanted to hear it from Rutte too.\n\nNATO takes all of its decisions by consensus, giving any of the 32 member countries an effective veto, including on whether they should take part in any joint effort or operation.\n\nTaking to social media, Orb\u00e1n said it was important for Hungary to establish \"that this agreement can stand the test of time.\" He posted Rutte's letter, dated June 18, a day after the two men had met in Brussels on the sidelines of a European Union summit.\n\nRutte wrote that \"in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General I will fully support this outcome of the talks between Jens Stoltenberg and you.\"\n\nIt was enough for Orb\u00e1n. \"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should be become the next Secretary General of NATO. In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General,\" he posted on X.\n\nBudapest had also complained about unidentified remarks that Rutte had made about the Hungarian government three years ago and demanded an apology.\n\nRutte wrote that he \"took note\" that his past remarks \"caused dissatisfaction in Hungary. My priority in a possible future capacity as NATO Secretary General will be to maintain unity and treat all Allies with the same level of understanding and respect.\"\n\nNATO secretaries-general are responsible for chairing meetings and guiding sometimes delicate consultations among member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function.\n\nRutte is far and away the preferred candidate of the majority of NATO allies, including big members like the United States and Germany. Earlier this year, Turkey voiced opposition to Rutte's bid but lifted its objections in April.\n\nThe last hurdle remains the candidature of Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who is nearing the end of his second five-year term as head of state, but officials and analysts believe it will not pose a major problem.\n\nStoltenberg is seen as a steady hand at NATO's helm for a decade and his mandate has been extended several times. Biden and his NATO counterparts had been due to name a successor when they met in Lithuania in July 2023, but no consensus could be found about a replacement.\n\n\"I mean it sincerely, you've been great. I just wish you'd extend your term another 10 years,\" Biden said as he met the former Norwegian prime minister at the White House on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType":

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organisation from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organisation that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nAlso Read: | Russia, North Korea pact shows mutual support by authoritarian powers: NATO chief\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade\", Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defence and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nFrom history scholar to business manager to politics A history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte's political career hasn't been all smooth sailing Rutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nAlso Read: | NATO at 75: Why the alliance was formed, where it stands today\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labelled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nExperience on the international political stage His years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU's efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nAlso Read: | As Sweden joins NATO, it bids farewell to more than two centuries of neutrality\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2 per cent of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05 per cent of its GDP, up from around 1.2 per cent a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed

He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for NATO and also for me.\"\n\nNATO's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Rutte has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support to Ukraine, stressing time and again what he said was the absolute need for a Russian battlefield defeat to secure peace in Europe.\n\nUnder his recent leadership, the Netherlands has ramped up defence spending above the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nRutte's support for Ukraine is underscored by his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, as the Netherlands holds Russia accountable for the downing of passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 - which killed all 298 passengers and crew, 196 of them from the Netherlands.\n\nHours before the NOS report, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to NATO's top job.\n\nNATO takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\"\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nStoltenberg's term will end on October 1, 10 years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass the opportunity to see a woman, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, take the helm of NATO for the first time - something several members had lobbied for.\n\nKallas, a candidate mainly touted by eastern European countries, was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states.\n\n(Reporting by Sabine Siebold, Charlotte Van Campenhout Humeyra Pamuk, Anthony Deutsch, Benoit Van Overstraeten, Boldizsar Gyori, Anita Komuves, Alan Charlish, Jan Lopatka, Jason

Isabel Webster grills minister over Boris Johnson as ex-PM tipped to be 'secret weapon'\n\nLike Stoltenberg, Rutte won plaudits for his careful handling of Trump during his first term in power -- when the ex-reality TV star reportedly even mulled pulling the United States out of NATO.\n\n\"I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate,\" Stoltenberg said on a visit to Washington Tuesday. \"He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week NATO announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance's target of spending two percent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\n- 'Teflon Mark' -\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.\n\nbur-del/ec/jj", "source": {"uri":

Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing follows a meeting Prime Minister Viktor Orban had with NATO's current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte\u00b4s bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nNATO's next chief will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\"\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.

Now he's going to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Over the course of more than a dozen years at the top of Dutch politics, Mark Rutte got to know a thing or two about finding consensus among fractious coalition partners. Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nFrom history scholar to business manager to politics\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte's political career hasn't been all smooth sailing\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nExperience on the international political stage\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU's efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.\n\nFor more NATO news from the AP: https://apnews.com/hub/nato", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news",

Meijer\n\nAMSTERDAM, June 20 (Reuters) - Mark Rutte, who looks set to be NATO's next secretary-general, is a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a staunch ally of Ukraine who honed his skills as a political dealmaker during nearly 14 years as Dutch prime minister.\n\nRutte, 57, has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support for Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, and says defeat on the battlefield for Moscow is vital to secure peace in Europe.\n\nHis view is heavily influenced by the downing of an airliner over Ukraine in 2014, which the Netherlands blames on Russia, and in which 196 of the 298 victims were Dutch. NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia, he says.\n\n\"He won\u00b4t stop at Ukraine if we don\u00b4t stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It\u00b4s about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics.\n\nAfter the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands has increased defence spending to more than the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv and investing heavily in its own military.\n\nHis path to replace Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became all but certain after Romania's President withdrew his own candidacy. Rutte already had the backing of the other 31 countries in the 32-state alliance.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members.\n\nSome members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia.\n\nTRANSATLANTIC BOND\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition.\n\nRutte, who is unmarried, has lived all his life in The Hague and had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics. But he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nHe is a strong backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he recalled meeting in Kyiv five years ago.\n\n\"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nBy contrast, even while warning of the threat posed by Putin, he has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems.\n\n\"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a debate with parliament in April.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots.\n\nIn his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte has forged good relationships with various British and U.S. leaders and is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is standing for re-election.\n\nThis could prove valuable experience, as Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nAt the annual Munich Security Conference last year, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\", and spend more on defence and ammunitions production, regardless of who wins the U.S. election.

With this appointment, Rutte follows in the footsteps of, among others, Joseph Luns, who held this position from 1971 to 1984. Rutte becomes the fourth Dutchman in this prestigious position, after a difficult process in which several countries initially opposed his candidacy.\n\nThe road to Rutte's appointment was anything but easy. Although 32 allies now unanimously support the Dutch politician, there was initial resistance from Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. These countries blocked Rutte's candidacy for various reasons, ranging from political considerations to internal policy issues. However, the diplomatic efforts of the Netherlands and its allies have paid off. This week, countries ceased their resistance one by one, with Romania being the last.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Johannis formally announced today that he would withdraw as an opposing candidate. \"We have decided to support the candidacy of Mark Rutte. His experience and leadership are of great value to NATO in these challenging times,\" said Johannis. This support clears the way for Rutte to take over the leadership of NATO.\n\nHowever, Rutte will not immediately take up his new role. The current secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will officially complete his term until October, although there is a possibility that Rutte will take office earlier. The exact date of the transition remains unclear, but insiders speculate that it could happen as early as September.\n\nThe term of a Secretary General at NATO lasts four years and can be extended if necessary. Rutte brings a wealth of experience from his time as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, a position he has held since 2010.

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU's efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more NATO news from the AP: https://apnews.com/hub/nato", "source": {"uri": "cbs17.com",

The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are implemented and speaks on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before succeeding Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte was put to the test.\n\nSecuring the post of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills to convince skeptics, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbn and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to support his candidacy.\n\nIt took a very long time. It's a complicated process, but it's an honor that it seems to have happened, Rutte told reporters in The Hague before cycling from work.\n\nA former NATO spokesperson said Rutte was a good candidate for the job.\n\nLike Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians who has developed a good working relationship not only with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after November's U.S. presidential election, said Oana Lungescu, NATO's former chief spokesperson.\n\nRutte is seen as a safe person to lead NATO through turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done over the past decade, Lungescu, now a member of the NATO think tank, told the Associated Press. defense and security, the Royal United Services Institute.\n\nA history graduate and former human resources director at multinational consumer products company Unilever, Rutte first became prime minister of the Netherlands in October 2010. He resigned last July as his four-party coalition fought over on how to curb migration.\n\nDespite being one of Europe's leading politicians for years, Rutte has remained down-to-earth.\n\nHe is often seen cycling around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting while eating an apple. When he handed in his resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he traveled to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nOn Thursday, he posed in jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses for selfies with people in front of his office while sitting on his bike.\n\nWhen he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after the 2022 Russian invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to kyiv, including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nHe said the war on Europe's eastern flank was one of the reasons he sought the post of NATO chief.\n\nWith everything that happened in Ukraine, the instability in the world and a number of people who thought maybe I could achieve this, you can't just put it aside, he said . And it's of course incredibly interesting work.\n\nRutte has recovered from a number of scandals while in power in the Netherlands. He was so adept at keeping political stains from clinging to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHer the third coalition government resigned in early 2021 following a scandal involving investigations into child protection benefits which wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nMonths later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival, leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition made up of the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nHis years in office also allowed him to hone his skills at the international level. Working the room with a broad smile and a firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte elaborated strong working relationships with powerful leaders like former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Frances Emmanuel Macron. He also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\nAs a veteran of European summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding than Stoltenberg of the complex NATO-EU relationship, Lungescu said. But it will also need to ensure that EU defense efforts complement NATO, rather than weaken it, at this critical time.\n\nWhile the Netherlands, under Ruttes' leadership, failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to surpass that target this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago, when the allies pledged to increase their military budgets following the annexation of Crimea by Russia.\n\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU\u00b4s efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

All NATO members supported Rutte, a strong ally of Ukraine. Romania announced its decision while donating a Patriot system to Ukraine for air defense. Rutte will now face the challenge of maintaining NATO's support for Ukraine against Russia.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis withdrew from the race to lead NATO on Thursday, clearing the way for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to become the next secretary-general of the transatlantic military alliance. All other NATO members had already backed Rutte, a staunch ally of Ukraine and outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to take over from Jens Stoltenberg, who is stepping down this year after a decade in charge.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine on NATO's doorstep and European nations concerned about the possible return of NATO-critical Donald Trump to the White House, alliance members concluded the highly experienced Rutte was the best person for the post. As it announced Iohannis's decision, Romania's supreme defence council said it would donate one of the country's two operational Patriot systems to Ukraine, responding to pleas from Kyiv to its allies for more air defence assistance.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Romania's decision \"will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror\". The supreme council, which is chaired by Iohannis, said the president had informed NATO last week of his decision to withdraw and Romania would now support Rutte's candidacy.\n\nWith all 32 NATO members now backing the Dutchman, diplomats said they expected the alliance's governing North Atlantic Council to formally select him for the post in the coming days. Rutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw NATO directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nDEFENCE SPENDING Under Rutte, the Netherlands has in recent years ramped up defence spending above NATO's target of 2% of GDP. It is providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nNorwegian ex-premier Stoltenberg's term at the helm of NATO will end on Oct. 1. He took office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Stoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden. By giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass up the opportunity to appoint a first female secretary-general - something multiple member states had said they were keen to do.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was widely considered a contender for the role, with strong support from eastern European countries. But she was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states. Kallas is now the leading candidate to be the next European Union foreign policy chief, according to diplomats.\n\nIohannis, whose second term as Romanian president ends this year, has repeatedly said eastern European states need better representation in Euro-Atlantic leadership roles. Romania, a member of both NATO and the European Union, has raised defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

He is now on track to bring his experience of leading four Dutch multi-party governments to the international stage. The new NATO Secretary General.\n\nOn Thursday, the Romanian president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top post, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and almost certain to lead the party. the largest military organization in the world starting at October.\n\nRutte's nomination could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a meeting. summit in Washington from July 9 to 11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guides sometimes delicate consultations among NATO's 32 member countries to ensure that an organization that operates by consensus can continue to function.

He resigned last July as his four-party coalition fought over on how to curb migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's most important politicians for years, Rutte has remained down-to-earth.\n\nHe is often seen cycling around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting while eating an apple. When he tendered the resignation of his government to King Willem-Alexander last year, he traveled in a Saab station wagon to an ornate royal palace.\n\nWhen he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after the 2022 Russian invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to kyiv, including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte's political career has not been smooth\n\nRutte has recovered from a number of scandals while in power in the Netherlands.

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron.

Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nDutch news outlet NOS quoted sources close to the matter as saying Rutte would succeed Stoltenberg, who steps down in October after nearly a decade at the helm. Reuters could not immediately obtain a comment from NATO on the news report.\n\nStoltenberg said the decision-making process was very close to a conclusion.\n\n\"I think it's obvious that we're very close to a conclusion in the alliance for allies to select the next Secretary General. And I think that's good news,\" he told a press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington.\n\n\"I think Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as prime minister, he is a close friend and colleague and I therefore strongly believe that very soon the alliance will have decided on my successor and that will be good for all of us, for NATO. And also for me.\"\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Prime Minister Viktor Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nNATO's next chief will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk, Benoit Van Overstraeten, Boldizsar Gyori, Anita Komuves, Alan Charlish, Jan Lopatka, Jason Hovet;

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nFrom history scholar to business manager to politics\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple. When he handed in his government's resignation to King Willem-Alexander last year, he drove to an ornate royal palace in a Saab station wagon.\n\nWhile he was Dutch prime minister, Rutte was a strong supporter of Ukraine and its right to defend itself after Russia's 2022 invasion. Under his leadership, the Netherlands pledged military hardware to Kyiv including Leopard tanks and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nRutte's political career hasn't been all smooth sailing\n\nRutte bounced back from a number of scandals while in office in the Netherlands. He was so adept at preventing political stains sticking to him that he earned the nickname Teflon Mark.\n\nHis third coalition government resigned in early 2021 over a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.\n\nA few months later, Rutte proved himself a master of survival by leading his conservative People's Party for Freedom and Democracy to victory in national elections and cobbling together his fourth and final coalition from the same parties that resigned to trigger the vote.\n\nExperience on the international political stage\n\nHis years in office also have honed his skills at an international level. Working the room with a broad smile and firm handshake at European Union summits, Rutte developed strong working relationships with powerful leaders such as former German chancellor Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. He's also visited Biden and Trump in Washington.\n\n\"As a veteran of EU summits, Rutte will bring a different understanding of the complex NATO-EU relation than Stoltenberg,\" said Lungescu. \"But he will also need to ensure that the EU's efforts on defence complement, rather than undermine NATO at this critical time.\"\n\nWhile the Netherlands under Rutte's leadership long failed to meet the NATO target of spending 2% of its GDP on defense, the Dutch are expected to edge past the mark this year. NATO estimates suggest the Netherlands will spend 2.05% of its GDP, up from around 1.2% a decade ago when the allies pledged to ramp up their military budgets after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Romania, the only member of the alliance holding out on his candidacy, removed its objection and was set to withdraw its own candidate for the job on Thursday.\n\nNATO officials confirmed to CNN that Klaus Iohannis, the Romanian president and its candidate for the job, has indicated to allies that he will be withdrawing from the running. The decision on Rutte could not be taken because there was not consensus while Iohannis was still in contention, but now that decision can go ahead - although the date for its confirmation has yet to be set.\n\nThe term of current secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, runs out on October 1.\n\nRutte will inherit a NATO that is racing to bolster its own security while also supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. The alliance is walking a tightrope of rearming and increasing military spending while avoiding provoking Moscow and escalating what is already the deadliest war on European soil in decades.\n\nWhile Rutte has been a staunch ally of Ukraine since the start of the war, critics have pointed out that during his time as Dutch leader the Netherlands' defense budget was often below the 2% of GDP target that NATO members are expected to spend.\n\nSources also say Rutte has been on a political journey, noting that in 2014 he attended the Winter Olympics in the Russian ski resort of Sochi with the Dutch king and queen while Russian tanks rolled into Crimea.\n\nHowever, with European politics likely to be unstable for the next five years and the prospect of a second Donald Trump term in the United States, Rutte, a moderate liberal, is thought to be in a good position to shepherd the 32-member alliance through what will be a difficult period.\n\nHis priority will be to maintain NATO's support for Kyiv. The alliance members have provided weapons, training and intelligence to Ukraine. Over time its position has evolved from not sending any tanks to allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with NATO weapons. Ukraine is also seeking to join the alliance.\n\nRutte must also oversee NATO's radical upgrade in defense and security capabilities. This will mean encouraging members to spend more money on defense and cooperating more closely on weapons procurement and plans for troop deployment.\n\nHe will also have to navigate the result of the next US election. NATO allies are aware that Trump has historically criticized NATO allies for not spending enough money on their own security and relying on America. While few believe Trump would withdraw from the alliance or intentionally undermine European security, his bombastic approach to diplomacy could allow belligerent nations to view NATO as being weak and vulnerable.\n\nSweden and Finland have both joined NATO since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a poke in the eye for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

How will he lead the Alliance?", "body": "NATO's Dutch tilt is official. After a seven-month campaign, outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte received unanimous approval from all thirty-two NATO member states to become the Alliance's next secretary general. Rutte won his last remaining necessary endorsement from Romania on Thursday. A staunch advocate of military aid for Ukraine with a political reputation as a conservative consensus-builder, Rutte will take office in early October after current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg steps down. How will Rutte navigate the war in Ukraine, efforts to bolster European security, and an upcoming US election with massive implications for the future of the Alliance? Below, our experts reveal the answers.\n\nClick to jump to an expert analysis:\n\nPhilippe Dickinson: Rutte must keep the Alliance unified to finish his predecessor's job\n\nRachel Rizzo: Rutte could be the key to 'Trump-proofing' the Alliance\n\nDominykas Kaminskas: Rutte has an outstanding track record, but he has 'a mammoth task' ahead of him\n\nJames J. Townsend Jr.: NATO's adversaries can see it close ranks around a new leader at the Washington summit\n\nHistory will look kindly on Stoltenberg's stewardship of NATO. Throughout his ten years as secretary general, he has navigated major shifts in geopolitics to imbue NATO with renewed purpose and direction. But how NATO navigates the challenges of the next decade will determine the long-term future of the world's most successful alliance.\n\nThe in-tray for Rutte, the Dutch prime minister since 2010, is daunting: reinforcing defense and deterrence across the Alliance in the face of a hostile and bellicose Russia, helping Ukraine to defeat Russia and welcoming Kyiv into the Alliance, and establishing NATO's role in dealing with the rising challenge posed by China. And he must manage these priorities all while evolving the Alliance to keep up with fast-paced technological change and without neglecting NATO's counterterrorism and crisis management responsibilities.\n\nBut the preeminent challenge is a political one. Rutte will take the reins of NATO at a time of significant political uncertainty across the Alliance. The new secretary general will have to manage whatever configuration of leaders the electorates in Europe and North America choose in the coming months. From his many years in Dutch politics and on the international stage, Rutte is an adroit balancer of political relationships. Much has been made about his role as a \"Trump whisperer,\" and it is this political savvy that helped him secure the job. This political savvy will be put to the test to an unprecedented extent in the years ahead. How he handles that test will determine whether he completes the good work of his laudable predecessor.\n\n-- Philippe Dickinson is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative within the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and a former career diplomat for the United Kingdom.\n\nAt last, NATO allies are poised to agree on Rutte as the Alliance's next secretary general. This decision has been a long time coming, as allies have extended Stoltenberg's term four times by unanimous consent.\n\nRutte will bring a wealth of pragmatic governance experience to his role as the new secretary general. Nicknamed \"the Trump whisperer,\" Rutte's leadership of NATO comes at a critical time, as he will assume the position less than a month before the US presidential election. Should Donald Trump, famously critical of NATO and European \"free riders,\" win a second term as US president, allies feel confident that Rutte is the key to Trump-proofing the alliance. He's seen as cool, calm, and collected. He knows how to handle big egos, he's worked with Trump before (even praising him at times), and he understands the need for European allies to increase their share of the burden of European security.\n\nFinally, Rutte has demonstrated strong Dutch support for Ukraine, including by sending F-16 fighter jets to help Kyiv fend off Russia's brutal assault. So will the Alliance look different under Rutte's leadership? His predecessor, Stoltenberg, is known as a master of diplomacy, deftly handling the now thirty-two-strong Alliance so that it speaks with one voice, a crucial art given the complex geopolitics both within and beyond Europe's borders. We should expect Rutte to be skilled at this as well. After all, he's led his country as prime minister for the last fourteen years.\n\n-- Rachel Rizzo is a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Europe Center.\n\nRutte will take office at a decisive moment for NATO. With a lot of talk about unity surrounding the Alliance's seventy-fifth anniversary and the upcoming summit in Washington, it's important to not only project it, but to ensure it. It's hard to think of anyone who would be better fit for this task than Rutte, his already-outstanding track record again confirmed by getting the thirty-two allies to sign off on his candidacy.\n\nMake no mistake, this will still be a mammoth task, even for someone with his experience. Despite all the talk about NATO being the strongest, the largest, and the best in so many different ways, it is also the most diverse it has ever been. Rutte can be very pragmatic, but at a time when the rules-based order is under serious threat, NATO requires leadership that will have to go beyond what everyone can agree on. We know the Dutch prime minister can find consensus when it's difficult, but whether he will be able to get allies to make sacrifices and decisions that they might not otherwise be comfortable making remains to be seen.\n\n-- Dominykas Kaminskas is a visiting fellow with the Transatlantic Security Initiative.\n\nStoltenberg gave a master class in how to keep the Alliance together during both political turbulence and war. He will hand off this legacy to Rutte, the seasoned Dutch leader who must now carry it forward and make it his own. To keep NATO together in time of war takes a strength of character that Rutte has in abundance and a political savvy that will help him work over, around, and through obstacles most leaders never have to confront. In this year, Rutte needs the full support not just of the allies, but of the International Staff and the NATO military authorities as well.\n\nLeadership change at NATO is hard, especially after a tenure as long as Stoltenberg's. But the July summit is the time for NATO's adversaries to see the Alliance closing ranks behind one of Europe's most seasoned leaders as we also say farewell to one of the NATO's greatest secretaries generals.\n\n-- James J. Townsend Jr. is a senior advisor in the Scowcroft Center's Transatlantic Security Initiative.\n\nRelated Experts: Rachel Rizzo, Philippe Dickinson, and Dominykas Kaminskas\n\nImage: Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte speaks to the media on the day of a European Union leaders informal summit in Brussels, Belgium June 17, 2024.

The country now has no air defense system at all.\n\nEarlier this month, Hungarian Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n received a guarantee from the current NATO Secretary General, Norwegian Jens Stoltenberg, that Hungary did not have to actively contribute to military support for Ukraine. This has already removed an important hurdle.\n\nOrb\u00e1n also called on Rutte to accept the criticism he made of Hungary in 2021. Rutte then said in response to Hungary's new anti-gay law that there would be no place in the European Union for Hungarians if they introduced such a law. Rutte then said that in a conversation last night, Orban no longer asked for an apology for the statement.

It also said that Iohannis had informed NATO late last week that he intended to pull out.\n\nHis withdrawal removes the last real hurdle Rutte might face. It should allow NATO to put on a show of unity and demonstrate solidarity with war-ravaged Ukraine when U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts meet in Washington on July 9-11 to mark NATO\u00b4s 75th birthday.\n\nRutte\u00b4s appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in coming days, or by the leaders when they meet in Washington. He would officially start work on Oct. 1.\n\nNATO secretaries-general are responsible for chairing meetings and guiding sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hungary lifted its veto on Rutte\u00b4s candidacy after the long-serving Dutch prime minister gave written guarantees that he would not force Budapest to take part in the military alliance\u00b4s new plans to provide support to Ukraine should he be appointed.\n\nRomanian President klaus Iohannis exits a voting cabin during European and local elections in Bucharest, Romania, Sunday, June 9, 2024.

I just wish you\u00b4d extend your term another 10 years,\" Biden said.\n\nIohannis is nearing the end of his second five-year term as Romania\u00b4s president and announced his intention to run in March.\n\nRomania, a NATO member since 2004, borders Ukraine and played an increasingly prominent role in the alliance throughout Russia\u00b4s full-scale invasion, including hosting a NATO meeting of foreign ministers in November 2022.\n\nAP video journalist Nicolae Dumitrache in Bucharest, Romania, contributed to this report.\n\nNetherland's Prime Minister Mark Rutte addresses the media at the end of an EU summit in Brussels, early Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump.

Now he's on track to bring the experience of leading four Dutch multiparty governments to the international stage as NATO's new secretary general.\n\nOn Thursday, Romania's president withdrew from the race for the alliance's top job, leaving Rutte the only remaining candidate and all but certain to head the world's biggest military organization from October.\n\nRutte's appointment could be sealed by a meeting of NATO ambassadors in the coming days, or when President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in Washington on July 9-11.\n\nThe secretary general chairs meetings and guide sometimes delicate consultations among the 32 NATO member countries to ensure that an organization that operates on consensus can continue to function. The NATO leader also ensures that decisions are put into action and speak on behalf of all members.\n\nEven before taking over from Jens Stoltenberg, Rutte has been put to the test.\n\nSecuring the job of NATO chief required all of Rutte's diplomatic skills as he convinced doubters, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to back his candidacy.\n\n\"Like Stoltenberg, Rutte is a pragmatist and one of the few European politicians to have developed a good working relationship not just with Joe Biden, but also with Donald Trump. That could prove a key asset for NATO after the November US presidential election,\" said Oana Lungescu, a former chief NATO spokesperson.\n\nRutte \"is seen as a safe pair of hands to lead NATO in turbulent times, just as Stoltenberg has done for the last decade,\" Lungescu, now a Fellow with the defense and security think tank, the Royal United Services Institute, told The Associated Press.\n\nFrom history scholar to business manager to politics\n\nA history graduate and former human resources manager at consumer products multinational Unilever, Rutte became prime minister of the Netherlands for the first time in October, 2010. He quit last July as his four-party coalition wrangled over how to rein in migration.\n\nAlthough he has been one of Europe's top politicians for years, Rutte has remained down to earth.\n\nHe can often be seen riding his bicycle around his hometown of The Hague, or walking from his office to a meeting eating an apple.

clearing the way for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to become the next secretary-general of the transatlantic military alliance.\n\nAll other NATO members had already backed Rutte, a staunch ally of Ukraine and outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to take over from Jens Stoltenberg, who is stepping down this year after a decade in charge.\n\nWith the war in Ukraine on NATO's doorstep and European nations concerned about the possible return of NATO-critical Donald Trump to the White House, alliance members concluded the highly experienced Rutte was the best person for the post.\n\nAs it announced Iohannis' decision, Romania's supreme defence council said it would donate one of the country's two operational Patriot systems to Ukraine, responding to pleas from Kyiv to its allies for more air defence assistance.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Romania's decision \"will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror\".\n\nThe supreme council, which is chaired by Iohannis, said the president had informed NATO last week of his decision to withdraw and Romania would now support Rutte's candidacy.\n\nWith all 32 NATO members now backing the Dutchman, diplomats said they expected the alliance's governing North Atlantic Council to formally select him for the post in the coming days.\n\nRutte will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw NATO directly into a war with Russia.\n\nUnder Rutte, the Netherlands

As the former Dutch prime minister, he's been a staunch ally of Ukraine and a fierce critic of Putin, advocating for robust European military support. His tenure as NATO chief looks to solidify transatlantic ties and strengthen the alliance's defense posture.\n\nMark Rutte, who looks set to be NATO's next secretary-general, is a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a staunch ally of Ukraine who honed his skills as a political dealmaker during nearly 14 years as Dutch prime minister. Rutte, 57, has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support for Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, and says defeat on the battlefield for Moscow is vital to secure peace in Europe.\n\nHis view is heavily influenced by the downing of an airliner over Ukraine in 2014, which the Netherlands blames on Russia, and in which 196 of the 298 victims were Dutch. NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia, he says. \"He won't stop at Ukraine if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It's about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics. After the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands has increased defence spending to more than the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv and investing heavily in its own military. His path to replace Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became all but certain after Romania's President withdrew his own candidacy. Rutte already had the backing of the other 31 countries in the 32-state alliance.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near. Under Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members.\n\nSome members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia. TRANSATLANTIC BOND\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition. Rutte, who is unmarried, has lived all his life in The Hague and had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics. But he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nHe is a strong backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he recalled meeting in Kyiv five years ago. \"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nBy contrast, even while warning of the threat posed by Putin, he has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems. \"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a debate with parliament in April.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots. In his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte has forged good relationships with various British and U.S. leaders and is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is standing for re-election. This could prove valuable experience, as Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nAt the annual Munich Security Conference last year, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\", and spend more on defence and ammunitions production, regardless of who wins the U.S. election.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

But she was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states.\n\nKallas is now the leading candidate to be the next European Union foreign policy chief, according to diplomats.\n\nIohannis, whose second term as Romanian president ends this year, has repeatedly said eastern European states need better representation in Euro-Atlantic leadership roles.\n\nRomania, a

At the same meeting, the council approved the donation of a Patriot air-defense system to Ukraine, which Kyiv had been pleading for.\n\nAccording to the council, Mr. Iohannis has asked council members to throw their support behind Mr. Rutte's bid. It also said that Mr. Iohannis had informed NATO late last week of his intention to withdraw his candidacy.\n\nThe move clears the final hurdle for Mr. Rutte's ascension to the position of NATO chief. On June 18, Hungary and Slovakia announced their support for Mr. Rutte, leaving Romania as the last of the 32 NATO members yet to endorse the Dutch premier.\n\nTurkey had also objected to Mr. Rutte's bid but lifted its veto in April.\n\nMr. Iohannis joined the race at a late stage -- when he declared his candidacy in March, the majority of NATO allies had already sided with Mr. Rutte.\n\nThroughout his three-month campaign, Mr. Iohannis advocated for unconditional support of Ukraine's war effort. Under his leadership, he said, NATO would provide Kyiv with \"all necessary support for however long it takes\" until the country prevails in its war against Russia.\n\n\"Russia will remain the most significant and direct threat to the Alliance for the foreseeable future,\" he wrote in an op-ed on Politico's European edition. \"We also have a moral, political, and strategic obligation to make sure Ukraine advances steadily on its path toward future NATO membership, as well as its EU accession.\"\n\nNATO's secretary-general is responsible for steering the process of consultation and decision-making in the alliance, representing the organization on the world stage, and supervising the staff at its headquarters in Brussels.\n\nSelection for the job is through informal diplomatic talks behind closed doors, and a final appointment is made when all members reach a consensus.\n\nCurrent Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway, will step down on Oct. 1 after serving a decade in the post. Among those who expressed interest in his job were Mr. Rutte and Mr. Iohannis, as well as Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas and Latvian Foreign Minister Krisjanis Karins.\n\nAs the war between Russia and Ukraine rages on with no clear end in sight, Mr. Rutte emerged as a more favorable candidate than those from Romania and the Baltic states, which come under direct military pressure from Russia due to their proximity. In fact, no one from a country that was once in the Warsaw Pact -- NATO's communist counterpart in Eastern Europe -- has ever served as NATO chief.\n\nMr. Rutte is his kingdom's longest-serving prime minister and the second longest-serving leader in NATO after Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nIn July 2023, Mr. Rutte announced that he would retire from Dutch politics after his cabinet collapsed on the issue of refugees. He stayed in the post as a caretaker prime minister following the November 2023 general election, in which his political coalition lost a total of 37 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives.",

He's a close friend and colleague.\"\n\nWhile Trump's return could pose one major challenge -- to NATO's east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia's President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the NATO chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv's weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow -- if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence -- a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\n- 'Teflon Mark' -\n\nDubbed \"Teflon Mark\" for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead NATO since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country's economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion -- leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile NATO countries along the alliance's eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the NATO job, Rutte's backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.", "source":

Meijer\n\nAMSTERDAM, June 18 (Reuters) - Mark Rutte, who looks set to be NATO's next secretary-general, is a staunch ally of Ukraine and a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who honed his skills as a political dealmaker during nearly 14 years as Dutch prime minister. Rutte, 57, has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support for Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, and says defeat on the battlefield for Moscow is vital to secure peace in Europe.\n\nHis view is heavily influenced by the downing of an airliner over Ukraine in 2014, which the Netherlands blames on Russia, and in which 196 of the 298 victims were Dutch. NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia, he says.\n\n\"He won\u00b4t stop at Ukraine, if we don\u00b4t stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It\u00b4s about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics.\n\nAfter the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands has increased defence spending to more than the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv and investing heavily in its own military. His path to replace Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became all but certain after Hungary and Slovakia indicated on June 18 that they would back his nomination to lead the 32-state alliance. That left only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis was also vying for the job, opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members. Some members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia.\n\nTRANSATLANTIC BOND\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition.\n\nRutte, who is unmarried, has lived all his life in The Hague and had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics, but he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nHe is a strong backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he recalled meeting in Kyiv five years ago.\n\n\"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nBy contrast, even while warning of the threat posed by Putin, he has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems.\n\n\"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a debate with parliament in April.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots.\n\nIn his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte has forged good relationships with various British and U.S. leaders and is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is standing for re-election. This could prove valuable experience, as Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nAt the annual Munich Security Conference last year, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\", and spend more on defence and ammunitions production, regardless of who wins the U.S. election.

Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing follows a meeting Prime Minister Viktor Orban had with NATO's current Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block NATO decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of NATO,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary-General.\"\n\nNATO's next chief will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other NATO countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\"\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have

NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia, he says.\n\n\"He won't stop at Ukraine if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It's about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics.\n\nAfter the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands has increased defence spending to more than the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv and investing heavily in its own military.\n\nHis path to replace Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became all but certain after Romania's President withdrew his own candidacy. Rutte already had the backing of the other 31 countries in the 32-state alliance.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members.\n\nSome members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia.\n\nTRANSATLANTIC BOND\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition.\n\nRutte, who is unmarried, has lived all his life in The Hague and had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics. But he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nHe is a strong backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he recalled meeting in Kyiv five years ago.\n\n\"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nBy contrast, even while warning of the threat posed by Putin, he has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems.\n\n\"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a debate with parliament in April.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots.\n\nIn his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte has forged good relationships with various British and U.S. leaders and is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is standing for re-election.\n\nThis could prove valuable experience, as Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nAt the annual Munich Security Conference last year, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\", and spend more on defence and ammunitions production, regardless of who wins the U.S. election.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com",

He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for Nato and also for me.\"\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato)'s next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Rutte has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support to Ukraine, stressing time and again what he said was the absolute need for a Russian battlefield defeat to secure peace in Europe.\n\nUnder his recent leadership, the Netherlands has ramped up defence spending above the 2% threshold of GDP required of Nato members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nRutte's support for Ukraine is underscored by his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, as the Netherlands holds Russia accountable for the downing of passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 - which killed all 298 passengers and crew, 196 of them from the Netherlands.\n\nHours before the NOS report, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to Nato's top job.\n\nNato takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies.\n\nOnly Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block Nato decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next secretary-general of Nato,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform. \"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for Nato secretary-general.\"\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other Nato countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the nation a \"crazy mission\".\n\nTurkiye and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkiye saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next Nato chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nStoltenberg's term will end on October 1.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type":

Initially, Slovakia preferred a candidate from central or eastern Europe but pivoted to support Rutte. With this endorsement, Rutte is close to securing consensus approval, awaiting only Romania's nod.\n\nSlovakia supports Mark Rutte's proposed appointment as the next NATO secretary-general, Slovak President Peter Pellegrini said on Tuesday, one of the last countries in the alliance to fall in line behind the outgoing Dutch prime minister.\n\nSlovakia had preferred a \"geographically\" closer candidate from central and eastern Europe, such as Romanian President Klaus Iohannis who had also sought the job, but now backs Rutte, Pellegrini said after a European Union summit in Brussels. \"After a final discussion with Mark Rutte and consultation with the Slovak government, Slovakia can imagine Mark Rutte as the NATO chief,\" and will support him, Pellegrini said at a news briefing broadcast live on television.\n\nThe United States, Britain, France and Germany back Rutte to succeed Jens Stoltenberg, who will step down as NATO's head in October. NATO takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. With the nods of Slovakia and Hungary, Rutte now awaits support from just Romania.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next NATO chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there. \"We will ask NATO to find somewhere in member states an air-defence system\" that could be placed in Slovakia until the country has its own system, Pellegrini said.\n\nSeparately, Hungary has also dropped its opposition to Rutte, Dutch media reported on Tuesday. Turkey told its allies in April it would support Rutte. Romania's Iohannis said in March he was running for the NATO top job, arguing Eastern European states needed better representation in Euro-Atlantic leadership roles.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Slovakia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Slovakia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Romania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Romania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/01_12_2023_09_33_55_8134116.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He's a close friend and colleague, and I therefore strongly believe that very soon, the alliance will have decided on my successor,\" he said. \"And that will be good for all of us, for Nato and also for me.\"\n\nNato's next secretary-general will face the challenge of sustaining allies' support for Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion, while guarding against any escalation that could draw the military alliance directly into a war with Moscow.\n\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Rutte has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support to Ukraine, stressing time and again what he said was the absolute need for a Russian battlefield defeat to secure peace in Europe.\n\nUnder his recent leadership, the Netherlands has ramped up defence spending above the 2% threshold of GDP required of Nato members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nRutte's support for Ukraine is underscored by his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin, as the Netherlands holds Russia accountable for the downing of passenger flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 - which killed all 298 passengers and crew, 196 of them from the Netherlands.\n\nHours before the NOS report, Hungary and Slovakia had given their support to the candidacy of Rutte, clearing a crucial hurdle on his way to Nato's top job.\n\nNato takes decisions by consensus, so any candidate needs the support of all 32 allies. Only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis is also vying for the job, is still officially opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nHungary's backing followed a meeting Orban had with Stoltenberg last week, where the two sides agreed that Hungary would not block Nato decisions on providing support for Ukraine but has agreed that it would not be involved.\n\n\"PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next Secretary General of Nato,\" Orban wrote on the X social media platform.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support PM Rutte's bid for Nato Secretary-General.\"\n\nOrban had earlier opposed Rutte's candidacy because he had expressed \"problematic\" opinions that included the idea that Hungary should leave the European Union.\n\nHungary has been at odds with other Nato countries over Orban's continued cultivation of close ties with Russia and refusal to send arms to Ukraine, with Budapest's foreign minister last month labelling plans to help the war-torn nation a \"crazy mission.\"\n\nTurkey and Slovakia have also changed course on Rutte's bid, with Turkey saying it would support him in late April and Slovakia announcing its support earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSlovakia, which borders Ukraine, had stressed the need for the next Nato chief to help deal with the protection of Slovak airspace, its President Peter Pellegrini said, after the previous Slovak government donated an S-300 system to Ukraine, and allies pulled out Patriot batteries that had been temporarily placed there.\n\nStoltenberg's term will end on October 1, 10 years after taking office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nDuring his tenure, Stoltenberg oversaw Nato's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined Nato since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass the opportunity to see a woman, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, take the helm of Nato for the first time - something several members had lobbied for.\n\nKallas, a candidate mainly touted by eastern European countries, was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person",

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte lacks support only from Hungary and Romania to become the new NATO secretary general, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAccording to the agency, the other 30 NATO countries have already come out in favor of his candidacy. The last country to support Rutte was Slovakia. President Peter Pellegrini said the previous day that he would support Rutte's candidacy if he would ensure that the alliance protects the country's airspace after the transfer of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nRomanian officials indicated in April that they would not oppose Rutte's appointment if he committed to prioritizing security issues in Eastern Europe and increasing the region's representation in the alliance, Bloomberg said. However, Bucharest has not yet completely endorsed the Dutch prime minister.\n\nEarlier, the Financial Times newspaper quoted sources as saying that Rutte promised his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban not to prevent Budapest from refusing to provide military assistance to Kiev within NATO if Hungary agrees to his candidacy for the post of the alliance's secretary general. He also said that in the coming days he would \"write a letter to the Hungarian prime minister,\" which should remove all contradictions between them.\n\nThe pledge by the Dutch prime minister came after months of Hungary blocking Rutte's candidacy for NATO secretary general, the newspaper explained.\n\nThe candidacy of the new NATO secretary general will be approved at the alliance summit in Washington in July. Earlier, 29 out of 32 NATO countries expressed support for Rutte's candidacy. Orban said he opposed Rutte because he proposed to \"bring Hungary to its knees\" and exclude it from the European Union. The Hungarian prime minister also said that he would like to meet and talk to Rutte to clarify some issues concerning his attitude towards Hungary.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bucharest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bucharest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Hungary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Hungary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Budapest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 226, "textEnd": 233}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Romania, the only member of the alliance holding out on his candidacy, removed its objection and was set to withdraw its own candidate for the job on Thursday.\n\nNATO officials confirmed to CNN that Klaus Iohannis, the Romanian president and its candidate for the job, has indicated to allies that he will be withdrawing from the running. The decision on Rutte could not be taken because there was not consensus while Iohannis was still in contention, but now that decision can go ahead - although the date for its confirmation has yet to be set.\n\nThe term of current secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, runs out on October 1.\n\nRutte will inherit a NATO that is racing to bolster its own security while also supporting Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. The alliance is walking a tightrope of rearming and increasing military spending while avoiding provoking Moscow and escalating what is already the deadliest war on European soil in decades.\n\nWhile Rutte has been a staunch ally of Ukraine since the start of the war, critics have pointed out that during his time as Dutch leader the Netherlands' defense budget was often below the 2% of GDP target that NATO members are expected to spend.\n\nSources also say Rutte has been on a political journey, noting that in 2014 he attended the Winter Olympics in the Russian ski resort of Sochi with the Dutch king and queen while Russian tanks rolled into Crimea.\n\nHowever, with European politics likely to be unstable for the next five years and the prospect of a second Donald Trump term in the United States, Rutte, a moderate liberal, is thought to be in a good position to shepherd the 32-member alliance through what will be a difficult period.\n\nHis priority will be to maintain NATO's support for Kyiv. The alliance members have provided weapons, training and intelligence to Ukraine. Over time its position has evolved from not sending any tanks to allowing Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with NATO weapons. Ukraine is also seeking to join the alliance.\n\nRutte must also oversee NATO's radical upgrade in defense and security capabilities. This will mean encouraging members to spend more money on defense and cooperating more closely on weapons procurement and plans for troop deployment.\n\nHe will also have to navigate the result of the next US election. NATO allies are aware that Trump has historically criticized NATO allies for not spending enough money on their own security and relying on America. While few believe Trump would withdraw from the alliance or intentionally undermine European security, his bombastic approach to diplomacy could allow belligerent nations to view NATO as being weak and vulnerable.\n\nSweden and Finland have both joined NATO since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a poke in the eye for Russian President Vladimir Putin. While Rutte may not see further expansion during his time in charge of the alliance, any increase in NATO's operations or capabilities will be seen as provocation in Moscow.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A key supporter of Ukraine and critic of Russian policies, Rutte has significantly influenced European defense strategies. With strong ties to British and U.S. leaders, his nomination has garnered substantial international backing.\n\nMark Rutte, who looks set to be NATO's next secretary-general, is a staunch ally of Ukraine and a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who honed his skills as a political dealmaker during nearly 14 years as Dutch prime minister. Rutte, 57, has been one of the driving forces behind Europe's military support for Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, and says defeat on the battlefield for Moscow is vital to secure peace in Europe.\n\nHis view is heavily influenced by the downing of an airliner over Ukraine in 2014, which the Netherlands blames on Russia, and in which 196 of the 298 victims were Dutch. NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia, he says. \"He won't stop at Ukraine, if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It's about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics. After the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands has increased defence spending to more than the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv and investing heavily in its own military. His path to replace Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became all but certain after Hungary and Slovakia indicated on June 18 that they would back his nomination to lead the 32-state alliance. That left only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis was also vying for the job, opposed to Rutte's candidacy. Stoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members. Some members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia. TRANSATLANTIC BOND\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition. Rutte, who is unmarried, has lived all his life in The Hague and had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics, but he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nHe is a strong backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he recalled meeting in Kyiv five years ago. \"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nBy contrast, even while warning of the threat posed by Putin, he has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems. \"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a debate with parliament in April.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots. In his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte has forged good relationships with various British and U.S. leaders and is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is standing for re-election. This could prove valuable experience, as Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked. At the annual Munich Security Conference last year, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\", and spend more on defence and ammunitions production, regardless of who wins the U.S. election.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Rutte's liberal party the VVD will form part of a coalition led by former spy chief Dick Schoof, after November elections that saw a surge in support for right-wing firebrand Geert Wilders.\n\nLast weekend, Rutte attended the Ukraine summit in Switzerland, from which he promised the Netherlands will \"continue to support Ukraine any way we can.

is set to become the next secretary general of Nato after his only rival dropped out of the race.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis informed the military alliance he was withdrawing his bid at the end of last week, his office said on Thursday.\n\nThe two had been vying to replace the incumbent Jens Stoltenberg, whose term expires in October.\n\nWhile Mr Rutte is the only remaining candidate in the race, he is yet to be officially confirmed by member states.\n\nMr Rutte, 57, will inherit overseeing Nato's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as the job of maintaining the US's commitment to the alliance if Donald Trump - who has previously expressed reticence about American involvement - is re-elected as president.\n\nMr Stoltenberg has been credited with dealing positively with Mr Trump in the past.\n\nHe told a security conference in February that Europe should work \"with whoever is on the dance floor\", according to AFP.\n\nMr Rutte put his hat in the ring for Nato's top job after saying he would leave politics in wake of the collapse of his coalition government last summer.\n\nHis successor, Dick Schoof, was nominated by the new Dutch coalition partners at the end of May, paving the way for Mr Rutte to step down.\n\nMr Rutte's support of Ukraine and his 14 year-stint at the top of European politics earned him candidacy endorsement from many Nato members, including key players in the UK, US, France and Germany.\n\nHowever, three member nations - Hungary, Romania and Turkey - initially held out.\n\nAfter expressing reservations, Turkey said it would support Mr Rutte's bid after the Dutch PM travelled there in April to speak to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Associated Press reported at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hungary - whose government Mr Rutte has previously been critical of - withdrew its opposition after the Dutch leader agreed Budapest would not be obliged to commit military aid to Ukraine.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban wrote on X/Twitter that as Mr Rutte had confirmed he \"fully supports\" the deal brokered with Mr Stoltenberg, Hungary was \"ready to support PM Rutte's bid\".\n\nAfter Mr Iohannis withdrew his candidacy, he asked his Romania's defence council to throw its support behind Mr Rutte, which they did, his office said.\n\nThe next Nato summit is due to be held in Washington DC in July.", "source":

Join us in this fight.\n\n\"There was a joke I heard the other day,\" Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told the audience of the Politico Defense Summit in November 2023, as the mandate of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenburg entered its final 12 months.\n\n\"The next Secretary General should be from a new member state...should definitely be from a country that has spent at least 2% of their GDP on defense, and it would be nice if it would be a woman.\"\n\n\"So it's logical it should be Mark Rutte,\" she joked, hinting that she, not the Dutch prime minister, would fulfill all three criteria.\n\nDespite Kallas' arguments, by March, Rutte had received the backing of the U.S. and U.K. and, by June, was supported by twenty-nine of NATO's thirty-two member states.\n\nOnly Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania were left to convince.\n\nRutte and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reportedly met on the sidelines of an EU leaders' dinner in Brussels on June 17. Rutte promised he would not interfere with Budapest's opting out of NATO initiatives to support Ukraine.\n\n\"In light of his pledge, Hungary is ready to support Prime Minister Rutte's bid for NATO Secretary General,\" Orban announced on June 18.\n\nSlovak President Peter Pellegrini also announced he was backing Rutte on the same day, leaving Bucharest as the last holdout. Romanian President Klaus Iohnannis is the long-shot competitor left in the running.\n\nSince becoming Dutch prime minister back in 2010, Rutte has kept a low-key persona in the Netherlands. The 57-year-old is known for cycling to work in The Hague, continuing to teach history one day a week at a local secondary school, and can be regularly spotted at a few cafes and restaurants in the city center.\n\nRutte, the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history, earned the nickname \"Teflon Mark\" for his slick handling of political scandals.\n\nDue to the nature of the Dutch parliamentary system, Rutte is used to working in complex coalitions. He is widely regarded as a stable, consensus-building politician, a feature that helped him secure the support of over 30 heads of state in his most recent top post bid.\n\nIn light of the U.S. presidential elections in November, Rutte has another competency that made him a popular candidate. During Donald Trump's presidency, Rutte proved to be able to deal with the White House's whims and communicate directly.\n\nAt the 2024 Munich Security Conference, Rutte appeared unencumbered by the prospect of another four years of Trump, arguing that Europe has to stop \"moaning and nagging and whining about Trump.\"\n\nThe remark echoed a comment he made about Trump in 2019 when he said, \"We have to work with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\nBefore 2014, working with Russian President Vladimir Putin was not off the table either. Rutte was present at events like the launch of the Nord Stream pipeline, though he occasionally raised concerns about issues such as LGBT+ rights in Russia.\n\nThis changed on July 17, 2014, when flight MH17 was shot down by Russian-led militants over eastern Ukraine two hours after taking off from Amsterdam Schipol airport.\n\nHe told Putin directly he was furious and repeatedly demanded that all the bodies be returned, according to a Politico profile. He gained a reputation as a European leader with whom Putin could not play mind games or attempt to intimidate.\n\nIn the following eight years, however, Rutte did not enact policies to get the Netherlands onto a war footing. Defense spending in the Netherlands dipped to 1.1% of GDP in 2015, a record low.\n\nThe same year, news emerged that a shortage of ammunition meant that many soldiers were training without bullets, with some resorting to making a \"bang\" noise to simulate their weapon being fired.\n\nContinued budget cutbacks and personnel shortages led one former general to describe the state of the Dutch military as being \"sick and on an IV drip\" by 2017.\n\nFollowing the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, defense spending rose to 1.6% in 2022 and an estimated 1.7% in 2023.\n\nThe Netherlands will finally spend 2% of the country's GDP on defense in 2024 and has emerged as a reliable partner for Kyiv, taking the lead with initiatives like providing F-16 planes to Ukraine.\n\nThe Netherlands has also allocated $4.35 billion in military aid to Ukraine, fifth overall.\n\nStill, the country lags behind nations in Central and Eastern Europe in terms of defense budget spending. Poland's spending on defense reached just over 3% of GDP in 2023 and plans to spend a colossal 4% in 2024.\n\nOver decades, the Dutch leader \"became a popular figure outside the Netherlands in the European arena,\" Denis Cenusa, an associated expert at the Eastern European Studies Center, told the Kyiv Independent.\n\nMeanwhile, Rutte spent months focused on winning over countries like Hungary and Turkey, which initially opposed his candidacy.\n\nNATO makes decisions \"not by means of voting, but by consensus-building,\" Anna van Zoest, the director of the Netherlands Atlantic Treaty Association and former Dutch diplomat posted to NATO headquarters, told the Kyiv Independent. \"Everyone in the end needs to be able to agree, and that requires a Secretary General who can take on a role as mediator.\"\n\nRutte would be able to find a middle ground between the cautious, large members of NATO, like Germany and the U.S., and the members that neighbor Russia, in part because the Netherlands fits into neither category.\n\nTherein lies a key reason the Netherlands has already produced three NATO Secretary Generals, van Zoest said.\n\n\"It's a country that's big enough to make an impact but small enough not to call the shots.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

NATO must be powerful to counter Moscow, and other European Union leaders must not be naive about Putin's Russia, he says.\n\n\"He won't stop at Ukraine, if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It's about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics.\n\nAfter the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands has increased defence spending to more than the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv and investing heavily in its own military.\n\nHis path to replace Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became all but certain after Hungary and Slovakia indicated on June 18 that they would back his nomination to lead the 32-state alliance.\n\nThat left only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis was also vying for the job, opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members.\n\nSome members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia.\n\nTRANSATLANTIC BOND\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition.\n\nRutte, who is unmarried, has lived all his life in The Hague and had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics, but he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nHe is a strong backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he recalled meeting in Kyiv five years ago.\n\n\"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nBy contrast, even while warning of the threat posed by Putin, he has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems.\n\n\"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a debate with parliament in April.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots.\n\nIn his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte has forged good relationships with various British and U.S. leaders and is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is standing for re-election.\n\nThis could prove valuable experience, as Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nAt the annual Munich Security Conference last year, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\", and spend more on defence and ammunitions production, regardless of who wins the U.S. election.\n\n(Reporting by Bart Meijer,

He will succeed Jens Stoltenberg, who has overseen the US-led bloc since 2014.\n\nRomanian President Klaus Iohannis had announced his candidacy for the job in March, six months after Rutte began his campaign, but notified the bloc on Thursday that he was withdrawing from consideration.\n\nOnly Hungary had endorsed Iohannis, but Prime Minister Viktor Orban announced on Tuesday that he had reached an agreement with Rutte. Another holdover, Slovakia, quickly followed suit.\n\nNATO at this point appears to have settled the succession issue before the July summit in Washington, where the bloc will celebrate its 75th anniversary. Rutte is expected to take over his duties on October 2. Not everyone has reacted to the news positively, however.\n\n\"I'm a hard NO on Rutte,\" said Richard Grenell, former acting head of US national intelligence and a confidant of former - and possibly future - President Donald Trump. \"The president of the United States in January 2025 will pick the NATO secretary-general,\" Grenell added.\n\n\"Mark Rutte spent 10+ years destroying our country. His promises are worthless. He's a pathological liar and a warmongering globalist,\" Dutch political commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek said following his endorsement by Orban, adding that having him as the secretary-general of NATO \"means serious trouble for humanity.\"\n\nRutte's critics have pointed out that in his 14 years of ruling the EU's fifth-largest economy, he failed to meet NATO's goal of having military spending account for 2% of the Netherlands' GDP. Likewise, he did not campaign very hard in Eastern Europe, which would have preferred someone more hawkish on Russia.\n\nStoltenberg has been the head of the bloc for a decade now, with his term extended four times due to disagreements about succession. The Ukraine conflict in 2022 saw his term extended through September 2023, which got pushed back again at last year's summit in Vilnius.\n\nMeanwhile, Rutte is still the caretaker prime minister of the Netherlands. He disbanded the Dutch government last July, after his coalition collapsed over immigration policy.

It is providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nNorwegian ex-premier Stoltenberg's term at the helm of NATO will end on Oct. 1. He took office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass up the opportunity to appoint a first female secretary-general - something multiple member states had said they were keen to do.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was widely considered a contender for the role, with strong support from eastern European countries. But she was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states.\n\nKallas is now the leading candidate to be the next European Union foreign policy chief, according to diplomats.\n\nIohannis, whose second term as Romanian president ends this year, has repeatedly said eastern European states need better representation in Euro-Atlantic leadership roles.\n\nRomania, a member of both NATO and the European Union, has raised defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Luiza Ilie, Sabine

This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It's about upholding the international rule of law,\" Rutte told the United Nations in September 2022, seven months after Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nRutte first took office in 2010 and went on to become the longest-serving Dutch prime minister before announcing last year that he planned to leave national politics.\n\nAfter the downing of flight MH17, he went from being primarily domestically focused to one of the EU's main dealmakers, playing an important role in European debates on immigration, debt and the response to COVID-19.\n\nUnder his leadership, the Netherlands has increased defence spending to more than the 2% threshold of GDP required of NATO members, providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv and investing heavily in its own military.\n\nHis path to replace Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down as NATO chief in October after nearly a decade at the helm, became all but certain after Hungary and Slovakia indicated on June 18 that they would back his nomination to lead the 32-state alliance.\n\nThat left only Romania, whose President Klaus Iohannis was also vying for the job, opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nStoltenberg said on Tuesday Rutte was a \"very strong\" candidate to replace him and a decision was near.\n\nUnder Stoltenberg, who joined a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the alliance has added Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden as new members.\n\nSome members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had hoped Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas would become the first woman to lead NATO but others saw her as too hawkish towards Russia.\n\nRutte will step aside formally as prime minister when the recently forged right-wing Dutch government replaces his centre-right coalition.\n\nRutte, who is unmarried, has lived all his life in The Hague and had hinted he might enjoy teaching after politics, but he cited the war in Ukraine as the reason for seeking an international post as he set his sights on the NATO leadership.\n\nHe is a strong backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he recalled meeting in Kyiv five years ago.\n\n\"It was clear even then: this is a man with a mission... I am convinced that Ukraine's success largely depends on the mentality he conveyed from the very beginning,\" Rutte told Reuters in April.\n\nBy contrast, even while warning of the threat posed by Putin, he has suggested the Russian leader is not as strong as he seems.\n\n\"Don't mentally overestimate Putin. I've talked to the man a lot. He's not a strong man, he's not a strong guy,\" Rutte said in a debate with parliament in April.\n\nRutte cemented his bid to become NATO's new chief last year while co-leading an international coalition that will deliver F-16 fighters to Ukraine and train Ukrainian pilots.\n\nIn his last months in office, he also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine, guaranteeing support from the Netherlands despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\nRutte has forged good relationships with various British and U.S. leaders and is widely seen as having been one of the most successful in the EU at dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump, who is standing for re-election.\n\nThis could prove valuable experience, as Trump's possible return has unnerved NATO leaders since the former president called into question U.S. willingness to support other members of the defence alliance if they were attacked.\n\nAt the annual Munich Security Conference last year, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\", and spend more on defence and ammunitions production, regardless of who wins the U.S. election.\n\n(Reporting by Bart Meijer,

It's not positive. We have to work something out.\"\n\nMore recently, Rutte displayed more Dutch directness at the Munich Security Conference in February, saying Europe had to work \"with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"All that whining and moaning about Trump -- I hear that constantly over the last couple of days, let's stop doing that,\" he said.\n\nRutte has a \"Mr Normal\" image that could not be further removed from the bling-bling former president.\n\nAs well as cycling to meet foreign leaders, he is known to do his own shopping at the local supermarket and drives himself to meet the king in his humble Saab station wagon.\n\nAnother viral video showed Rutte spilling a cup of coffee at a government building and insisting on mopping it up himself, as cleaning staff applauded and he chuckled at his own clumsiness.\n\nOn Ukraine, the Netherlands signed a deal this year for two billion euros ($2.1 billion) of military assistance over 10 years, later adding an additional one billion.\n\nRutte also spearheaded the push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets, a decision described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"historic\" on a trip to the Netherlands.\n\n\"Ukraine must win this battle. For their security and ours,\" said Rutte, who is posed to be the fourth Dutchman to lead the NATO alliance.\n\nRutte's 14-year tenure as Dutch PM was marked by the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed.\n\nSpeaking in Paris just two weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rutte described President Vladimir Putin in uncompromising terms: \"cold-hearted, brutal, merciless.\"\n\nAs the second longest-serving EU leader after Hungary's Viktor Orban, Rutte's diplomatic skills came to the fore as he toured NATO capitals to drum up support.\n\nHe finally wore down main holdouts Turkey and Hungary, the latter still angry at Rutte, who said Budapest should not be in the EU after it passed a law banning the promotion of LGBTQ content to minors.\n\nRutte also infuriated some southern European countries with his hard line on bailouts, earning him yet another soubriquet: \"Mr. No.\"\n\nDomestically, he was tainted by many scandals, with the sudden collapse of his coalition last year over an asylum row sparking elections that resulted in victory for far-right leader Geert Wilders.\n\nArguably the most damaging came in 2021 when his government was forced to resign after thousands of parents -- many from ethnic minority backgrounds -- were falsely accused of childcare subsidy fraud.\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Rutte's father Izaak was a trader, while his mother Mieke was the sister of Izaak's first wife, who died in a Japanese internment camp in World War II.\n\nHe initially wanted to be a concert pianist, but after attending the prestigious Leiden University, he joined Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever, including a stint at its peanut butter division, Calve.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"man of habit and tradition\" who has spent his whole life in The Hague and volunteers as a teacher.\n\nHis public image is perhaps best summed up by his regular hairdresser, Marco Rimmelzwaan, who said that \"Mark doesn't like change, he always wants the same thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [],

According to Pellegrini, it was understandable that Slovakia could imagine a representative of Central and Eastern Europe in this position.\n\n\"Following consultations with both candidates and after consultations with Prime Minister Robert Fico [Smer-SD] and the Slovak government, the Slovak Republic can imagine supporting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the head of the Alliance,\" stated Pellegrini.\n\nThe Slovak head of state also pointed out that this support is accompanied by a plea and request from Slovakia that Rutte, as the next NATO chief, should ensure the protection of the Slovak airspace, which is unprotected after the handover of previous air-defence systems to Ukraine and after NATO allies - the Dutch and Italians - withdrew their temporarily provided systems from Slovakia.\n\n\"Slovakia doesn't have any air-defence system today, and that is why Rutte and I discussed a situation that if he is elected as the head of the Alliance, he should make efforts to push through the protection and defence of Slovakia's airspace - at least until Slovakia is able to protect this airspace with its own capacities. Rutte expressed his willingness to address this in the future,\" said the Slovak president.\n\nPellegrini added that he had also asked Rutte to take into account the geographical principle when filling positions in NATO at lower levels of management after his election.", "source": {"uri": "newsnow.tasr.sk", "dataType": "news", "title": "newsnow.tasr.sk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Slovakia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Slovakia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Romania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Romania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fico", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Fico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central and Eastern Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense Ministries", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://newsnow.tasr.sk/content/images/2024/06/20241506_pellegrini_inauguracia_45051076.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Reports indicate that Budapest no longer demands an apology from the outgoing Dutch prime minister regarding his comments on Hungarian democracy.\n\nOnly the British publication mentions that Rutte has \"made an offer\" to Hungary, the most pro-Russian country in the EU and NATO, promising that under his potential leadership, Hungary would not have to participate in NATO actions supporting Ukraine, including financial contributions. Reuters noted that this commitment had already been made the previous week by the current NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will remain in office until October. Rutte is expected to leave his position in July.\n\nSlovakia has shown its preference for a new NATO Secretary General who is geographically closer, supporting Mark Rutte for the role. President Peter Pellegrini, whose party is an ally of Prime Minister Robert Fico, made this announcement, indirectly referencing the Romanian president Klaus Iohannis's candidacy.\n\nThe outgoing Dutch prime minister has garnered support from key alliance members such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Hungary's recent agreement leaves Rutte awaiting only Romania's position. Since 2019, Romania's Mircea Geoana has held the position of deputy NATO Secretary General, marking a first for a post-Cold War member country.\n\nMeanwhile, current NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that China must face consequences if it continues supporting Russia's war in Ukraine. In an interview with the BBC, he noted that Beijing's dual approach -- supporting Russia's military efforts while maintaining relations with European allies -- is unsustainable.\n\nStoltenberg, speaking from Washington, highlighted that China provides critical technologies, such as microelectronics, essential for Russia's missile and weapons production used against Ukraine. He suggested that if China does not alter its behavior, it will eventually face economic repercussions.\n\nChina, where about 20 firms (including those based in Hong Kong) were sanctioned by the US last month for supporting Russia, has defended its business dealings with Moscow, insisting it does not sell lethal weapons and adheres to laws regarding dual-use items.\n\n\"The purpose of NATO is not to wage war, but to prevent war,\" stated Stoltenberg, echoing NATO's defensive stance. He also remarked that Russia is increasingly aligning with authoritarian regimes like Iran, China, and North Korea, which allegedly sent missiles to Russia in exchange for technology for their missile and nuclear programs.\n\nAhead of a meeting with US President Joe Biden, Stoltenberg noted that more than 20 NATO countries are expected to meet the 2% defense spending target this year, the highest since the commitment was made in 2014. He emphasized that increased defense spending benefits both Europe and America, particularly as a significant portion of the funds are spent in the US.\n\nStoltenberg's comments to The Sunday Telegraph suggested that NATO might consider increasing its nuclear warhead deployment as a deterrent against rising threats from Russia and China. The Kremlin criticized these remarks, calling them an escalation of tensions.", "source": {"uri": "novinite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Novinite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's not positive. We have to work something out.\"\n\nMore recently, Rutte displayed more Dutch directness at the Munich Security Conference in February, saying Europe had to work \"with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"All that whining and moaning about Trump -- I hear that constantly over the last couple of days, let's stop doing that,\" he said.\n\n- 'Mr Normal' -\n\nRutte has a \"Mr Normal\" image that could not be further removed from the bling-bling former president.\n\nAs well as cycling to meet foreign leaders, he is known to do his own shopping at the local supermarket and drives himself to meet the king in his humble Saab station wagon.\n\nAnother viral video showed Rutte spilling a cup of coffee at a government building and insisting on mopping it up himself, as cleaning staff applauded and he chuckled at his own clumsiness.\n\nOn Ukraine, the Netherlands signed a deal this year for two billion euros ($2.1 billion) of military assistance over 10 years, later adding an additional one billion.\n\nMore from this section Young heart patients find community at Camp Taylor Lawmakers in Thailand vote in favour of same-sex marriage How are consumers addressing changes in their cost of living?\n\nRutte also spearheaded the push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets, a decision described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"historic\" on a trip to the Netherlands.\n\n\"Ukraine must win this battle. For their security and ours,\" said Rutte, who is posed to be the fourth Dutchman to lead the NATO alliance.\n\nRutte's 14-year tenure as Dutch PM was marked by the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed.\n\nSpeaking in Paris just two weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rutte described President Vladimir Putin in uncompromising terms: \"cold-hearted, brutal, merciless.\"\n\n- 'Mr. No' -\n\nAs the second longest-serving EU leader after Hungary's Viktor Orban, Rutte's diplomatic skills came to the fore as he toured NATO capitals to drum up support.\n\nHe finally wore down main holdouts Turkey and Hungary, the latter still angry at Rutte, who said Budapest should not be in the EU after it passed a law banning the promotion of LGBTQ content to minors.\n\nRutte also infuriated some southern European countries with his hard line on bailouts, earning him yet another soubriquet: \"Mr. No.\"\n\nDomestically, he was tainted by many scandals, with the sudden collapse of his coalition last year over an asylum row sparking elections that resulted in victory for far-right leader Geert Wilders.\n\nArguably the most damaging came in 2021 when his government was forced to resign after thousands of parents -- many from ethnic minority backgrounds -- were falsely accused of childcare subsidy fraud.\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Rutte's father Izaak was a trader, while his mother Mieke was the sister of Izaak's first wife, who died in a Japanese internment camp in World War II.\n\nHe initially wanted to be a concert pianist, but after attending the prestigious Leiden University, he joined Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever, including a stint at its peanut butter division, Calve.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"man of habit and tradition\" who has spent his whole life in The Hague and volunteers as a teacher.\n\nHis public image is perhaps best summed up by his regular hairdresser, Marco Rimmelzwaan, who said that \"Mark doesn't like change, he always wants the same thing.\"\n\nbur-ric/jm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It is providing F-16 fighter jets, artillery, drones and ammunition to Kyiv as well as investing heavily in its own military.\n\nNorwegian ex-premier Stoltenberg's term at the helm of NATO will end on Oct. 1. He took office in 2014, just a few months after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg oversaw NATO's shift from an alliance mainly engaged in crisis management missions in far-off places such as Afghanistan back to its roots of defence against Russia.\n\nFour countries have joined NATO since Stoltenberg took office - Montenegro, North Macedonia, Finland and Sweden.\n\nBy giving the top job to Rutte, the alliance will pass up the opportunity to appoint a first female secretary-general - something multiple member states had said they were keen to do.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was widely considered a contender for the role, with strong support from eastern European countries. But she was seen as too hawkish towards Russia by some western member states.\n\nKallas is now the leading candidate to be the next European Union foreign policy chief, according to diplomats.\n\nIohannis, whose second term as Romanian president ends this year, has repeatedly said eastern European states need better representation in Euro-Atlantic leadership roles.\n\nRomania, a member of both NATO and the European Union, has raised defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n(Reporting and writing by Luiza Ilie, Sabine

It's not positive. We have to work something out.\"\n\nMore recently, Rutte displayed more Dutch directness at the Munich Security Conference in February, saying Europe had to work \"with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"All that whining and moaning about Trump -- I hear that constantly over the last couple of days, let's stop doing that,\" he said.\n\n'Mr Normal'\n\nRutte has a \"Mr Normal\" image that could not be further removed from the bling-bling former president.\n\nAs well as cycling to meet foreign leaders, he is known to do his own shopping at the local supermarket and drives himself to meet the king in his humble Saab station wagon.\n\nAnother viral video showed Rutte spilling a cup of coffee at a government building and insisting on mopping it up himself, as cleaning staff applauded and he chuckled at his own clumsiness.\n\nOn Ukraine, the Netherlands signed a deal this year for two billion euros ($2.1 billion) of military assistance over 10 years, later adding an additional one billion.\n\nRutte also spearheaded the push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets, a decision described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"historic\" on a trip to the Netherlands.\n\n\"Ukraine must win this battle. For their security and ours,\" said Rutte, who is posed to be the fourth Dutchman to lead the NATO alliance.\n\nRutte's 14-year tenure as Dutch PM was marked by the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed.\n\nSpeaking in Paris just two weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rutte described President Vladimir Putin in uncompromising terms: \"cold-hearted, brutal, merciless.\"\n\n'Mr. No'\n\nAs the second longest-serving EU leader after Hungary's Viktor Orban, Rutte's diplomatic skills came to the fore as he toured NATO capitals to drum up support.\n\nHe finally wore down main holdouts Turkey and Hungary, the latter still angry at Rutte, who said Budapest should not be in the EU after it passed a law banning the promotion of LGBTQ content to minors.\n\nRutte also infuriated some southern European countries with his hard line on bailouts, earning him yet another soubriquet: \"Mr. No.\"\n\nDomestically, he was tainted by many scandals, with the sudden collapse of his coalition last year over an asylum row sparking elections that resulted in victory for far-right leader Geert Wilders.\n\nArguably the most damaging came in 2021 when his government was forced to resign after thousands of parents -- many from ethnic minority backgrounds -- were falsely accused of childcare subsidy fraud.\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Rutte's father Izaak was a trader, while his mother Mieke was the sister of Izaak's first wife, who died in a Japanese internment camp in World War II.\n\nHe initially wanted to be a concert pianist, but after attending the prestigious Leiden University, he joined Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever, including a stint at its peanut butter division, Calve.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"man of habit and tradition\" who has spent his whole life in The Hague and volunteers as a teacher.\n\nHis public image is perhaps best summed up by his regular hairdresser, Marco Rimmelzwaan, who said that \"Mark doesn't like change, he always wants the same thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You may follow him at Twitter @FidelRahmati\n\nAccording to a report by Dutch national broadcaster NOS, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is poised to assume leadership of NATO following widespread support from allies, including Hungary and Slovakia. Rutte, known for his staunch support of Ukraine and criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has garnered endorsement crucial for his candidacy, Reuters reported.\n\nSpeaking alongside U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington, Jens Stoltenberg, the current NATO chief, hinted at Rutte's impending appointment but stopped short of confirmation. He praised Rutte's experience and leadership qualities, anticipating a swift conclusion to the selection process.\n\nRutte's tenure as NATO Secretary-General will confront significant challenges, particularly in maintaining allied support for Ukraine amidst Russia's ongoing invasion, while navigating the risk of escalation that could entangle NATO in direct conflict with Moscow.\n\nUnder Rutte's leadership, the Netherlands has significantly bolstered its defense spending, surpassing NATO's 2% GDP threshold and supplying critical military equipment to Ukraine. Rutte's unwavering backing for Ukraine stems partly from Dutch outrage over the downing of flight MH17, a tragedy pinned on Russia.\n\nRecent endorsements from Hungary and Slovakia mark crucial diplomatic victories for Rutte, clearing obstacles in his path to NATO leadership. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reversed his opposition, citing Rutte's commitment to NATO unity and Ukrainian support.\n\nOrban's shift underscores a broader consensus among NATO members, though some reservations persist, notably from Romania, where President Klaus Iohannis remains opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\nTurkey and Slovakia's endorsements further solidify Rutte's position, with Slovakia emphasizing regional security concerns, including protecting its airspace amidst escalating tensions.\n\nStoltenberg's decade-long stewardship of NATO has been pivotal in redefining the alliance's role from crisis management to a more robust defense posture, particularly against Russian aggression. His term concludes on October 1, coinciding with a period of heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nBy electing Rutte, NATO bypasses the opportunity to appoint its first female Secretary-General, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, due to concerns over her perceived hawkish stance towards Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Rutte's imminent assumption of NATO's top post signifies a pivotal moment for the alliance, promising continuity in its response to global security challenges while navigating complex diplomatic landscapes. His leadership will likely shape NATO's future engagements and strategies in safeguarding European stability and transatlantic security partnerships.", "source": {"uri": "khaama.com", "dataType":

It is my understanding that you stressed that no Hungarian personnel would take part in these activities and no Hungarian funds will be used to support them.\"\n\nThe Dutch leader, 57, added that he would respect the commitment given to Hungary, writing \"in a possible future capacity as Nato secretary general, I will fully support this outcome of the talks\" and added: \"I look forward to our future engagement - whatever that might be.\"\n\nSlovakia, another Nato member whose government is seen as sympathetic to Russia, also said on Tuesday it was also willing to support Rutte. Peter Pellegrini, the country's president, said in a briefing: \"the Slovak republic can imagine supporting the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte as the head of the alliance.\"\n\nNato secretary generals are chosen by consensus from the 32 members of the alliance, and with Hungary and Slovakia declaring for Rutte, that only leaves Romania as the final holdout. The country's president, Klaus Iohannis, was a rival candidate, but has picked up no support and is expected by alliance members to withdraw shortly.\n\nStoltenberg, who normally never comments on the succession process, said that the effort to replace him had all but concluded at a press conference after a summit meeting with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington DC.\n\n\"With the announcement by prime minister Orb\u00e1n today, I think it is obvious we are very close to a conclusion in the alliance for allies to select a next secretary general. Mark Rutte is a very strong candidate. He has a lot of experience as prime minister. He is a close friend and colleague.\n\n\"I strongly believe that very soon the alliance will have decided on my successor and this will be good for all of us, for Nato and also for me,\" he said.\n\nStoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, became Nato's secretary general in 2014 and his term of office had been extended repeatedly after the alliance failed to find a successor. But this year, after Stoltenberg stressed he could stay on no longer, Rutte came forward and swiftly won the support of the US, UK, Germany and France.\n\nRutte, a centre-right politician, has been the prime minister of the Netherlands for 14 years, but said he would step down a year ago, and is expected to be replaced shortly after extended coalition negotiations to form a new Dutch government. Known as \"Teflon Mark\" for his powers of survival, Rutte also continued to teach social studies one day a week in schools in The Hague during the time he was prime minister.\n\nNext month, Nato will hold its annual summit in Washington DC next month, at a time when Ukraine is looking for further assistance in the face of renewed attacks from Russia. Rutte is expected to take over as the head of the alliance after the summit, which will discuss how to ensure long-term military support for Ukraine.\n\nAs well as finding ways to help Ukraine, without the country becoming a fully fledged member, Rutte may have to deal with Donald Trump, the Republican challenger to Joe Biden for the US presidency. Trump repeatedly voiced scepticism about the value of the alliance and even mooted trying to quit amid complaints about levels of defence spending by other members.\n\nEarlier this week, Stoltenberg said that \"more than 20 allies will spend at least 2% of GDP on defence,\" a Nato target originally set in 2014, compared with 11 countries 12 months ago. Trump threatened earlier this year he would not defend any Nato member that was \"delinquent\" and did not spend up to this level.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's not positive. We have to work something out.\"\n\nMore recently, Rutte displayed more Dutch directness at the Munich Security Conference in February, saying Europe had to work \"with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"All that whining and moaning about Trump -- I hear that constantly over the last couple of days, let's stop doing that,\" he said.\n\n- 'Mr Normal' -\n\nRutte has a \"Mr Normal\" image that could not be further removed from the bling-bling former president.\n\nAs well as cycling to meet foreign leaders, he is known to do his own shopping at the local supermarket and drives himself to meet the king in his humble Saab station wagon.\n\nAnother viral video showed Rutte spilling a cup of coffee at a government building and insisting on mopping it up himself, as cleaning staff applauded and he chuckled at his own clumsiness.\n\nOn Ukraine, the Netherlands signed a deal this year for two billion euros ($2.1 billion) of military assistance over 10 years, later adding an additional one billion.\n\nRutte also spearheaded the push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets, a decision described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"historic\" on a trip to the Netherlands.\n\n\"Ukraine must win this battle. For their security and ours,\" said Rutte, who is posed to be the fourth Dutchman to lead the NATO alliance.\n\nRutte's 14-year tenure as Dutch PM was marked by the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed.\n\nSpeaking in Paris just two weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rutte described President Vladimir Putin in uncompromising terms: \"cold-hearted, brutal, merciless.\"\n\n- 'Mr. No' -\n\nAs the second longest-serving EU leader after Hungary's Viktor Orban, Rutte's diplomatic skills came to the fore as he toured NATO capitals to drum up support.\n\nHe finally wore down main holdouts Turkey and Hungary, the latter still angry at Rutte, who said Budapest should not be in the EU after it passed a law banning the promotion of LGBTQ content to minors.\n\nRutte also infuriated some southern European countries with his hard line on bailouts, earning him yet another soubriquet: \"Mr. No.\"\n\nDomestically, he was tainted by many scandals, with the sudden collapse of his coalition last year over an asylum row sparking elections that resulted in victory for far-right leader Geert Wilders.\n\nArguably the most damaging came in 2021 when his government was forced to resign after thousands of parents -- many from ethnic minority backgrounds -- were falsely accused of childcare subsidy fraud.\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Rutte's father Izaak was a trader, while his mother Mieke was the sister of Izaak's first wife, who died in a Japanese internment camp in World War II.\n\nHe initially wanted to be a concert pianist, but after attending the prestigious Leiden University, he joined Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever, including a stint at its peanut butter division, Calve.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"man of habit and tradition\" who has spent his whole life in The Hague and volunteers as a teacher.\n\nHis public image is perhaps best summed up by his regular hairdresser, Marco Rimmelzwaan, who said that \"Mark doesn't like change, he always wants the same thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

Romania will back Rutte and donate one of its two operational Patriot missile systems to Ukraine on condition that allies replace it with a similar air-defence system, Bucharest's Supreme Defence Council, chaired by Iohannis, said.\n\nEarlier in the week Rutte persuaded Viktor Orb\u00e1n to support his bid, overcoming years of tensions between the EU's two longest serving leaders over democratic standards in Hungary and EU spending. At a meeting in Brussels, Rutte gave the Hungarian leader assurances that no Hungarian troops or money would be deployed in Ukraine.\n\nAfter that meeting, Orb\u00e1n said: \"We reached an important agreement with Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. We agreed that no Hungarian personnel will take part in the activities of Nato in Ukraine and no Hungarian funds will be used to support them.\n\n\"Our next step this week was to ensure that this agreement can stand the test of time. After yesterday's meeting in Brussels, PM Mark Rutte confirmed that he fully supports this deal and will continue to do so, should he become the next secretary general of Nato.\"", "source": {"uri":

If you ask me a third time, I will say yes.\"\n\nFrom that moment on, Rutte -- who had been prime minister since 2010 -- started behaving differently. Slowly, methodically, he began working towards his goal: succeeding Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's current secretary-general, in October 2024. This week, after reportedly having secured Hungarian and Slovakian endorsements and the withdrawal of the candidacy of Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, he is essentially there.\n\nIt's only fair to wonder what kind of \"sec-gen\" Rutte will be -- and whether he can steer the trans-Atlantic alliance through turbulent times. Some indications can be found in Rutte's long career -- both his 14-year premiership, during which he led four different governing coalitions in the Netherlands, and his careful preparations to secure the Brussels-based NATO job.\n\nProbably the most important thing to know about Rutte, who was born in 1967 as the youngest of seven in a middle-class family in The Hague (his father managed a car dealership), is that he is a very controlled person. He often gives people the impression that he is spontaneous, taking things lightly as they come. But under the surface of the easygoing, smiling Dutchman who cycles to the office, apple in hand, there is a lot more going on.\n\nAll his professional life, Rutte has worked in management functions -- first as a human resources official for Unilever; then as a liberal party leader starting in 2006; and during the 14 years since 2010, managing both left-wing and right-wing characters in the governments that he led. Many who observes him in these roles say his management style is shaped, above all, by his desire to prevent surprises.\n\nHe does this first by trying to work with people he can trust. He is highly personable with staff, often asking them about family, hobbies, and holidays. And he remembers everything -- from spouses' names to a joke that someone made during a trip more than a decade ago. But this intimacy is also a way of managing his relationships with staff and getting a read on them, thus anticipating their thoughts and actions.\n\nTrust, for Rutte, is the product of routine -- both at the office and in his private life. Every year, he rents the same simple holiday house with family members. For 30 years, he has spent a few days each year in New York with the same friend, staying in the same cheap hotel in Chinatown, eating in the same restaurants, always meeting Robert Caro, the biographer of former U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. (Rutte, a historian by training, is an avid reader of American political biographies.) In The Hague, he always takes coffee on Saturday morning in the same caf\u00e9, then gets his groceries at the same Albert Heijn supermarket. On Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, he meets other friends -- again, always the same ones -- at a sports club. During government meetings that run late, he tends to order the same food. The whole town knows about these habits, and many make fun of it.\n\nIn a new biography about Rutte, called Het Raadsel Rutte (The Rutte Riddle), Dutch political reporters Ron Fresen and Wilma Borgman quote his New York travel companion, who explains they never discuss where to eat \"because we know it already. This saves us time and energy we can spend discussing more interesting things.\"\n\nSo many rituals might drive other people crazy, but Rutte thrives on them. They help him make the world a little more predictable. He needs them to organize the world, eliminating background noises so he can focus on getting his job done.\n\n\"Rutte is never off duty,\" a Dutch diplomat told me recently, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"He is always on the phone, convincing somebody about something.\" He hardly has a private life. A single man, he has lived in the same modest house with the same furniture for 30 years. As the aforementioned book describes, hardly anyone ever goes there; he never cooks, he does the cleaning himself, and doesn't even own a coffee machine. He is a political animal whose life mostly consists of one thing: work.\n\nAsked by schoolchildren on the Dutch television program Schooltv in 2016 what he wanted to become when he was little, Rutte answered: \"Work for the fire brigade or become a pianist.\" Perhaps -- but it's instructive that his mother already called him \"de directeur\" (the boss) when he was a boy. And when he became politically active for the conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) when he was still a teenager, he would play \"prime minister,\" letting himself be interviewed by a friend playing a journalist.\n\nFor a politician, Rutte has a remarkably small ego. Politicians are often solo players with a strong urge to shine. Rutte, however, functions differently. He is uneasy with luxury, routinely asking ambassadors to book him a simpler hotel the next time that he visits their countries. When a suit is not required, he wears jeans, a hoodie, and sneakers.\n\nHe is also a team player. A pragmatist, he wants to solve people's problems. In the fragmented Dutch political landscape, with numerous prima donnas, compromises are essential to get anything done. So he tries to forge them, and he has no trouble giving others credit for an achievement. During the four Dutch governing coalitions he formed -- both with left-wing and very right-wing parties -- insiders were often struck by the ease with which Rutte made compromises, especially when negotiations were at breaking point. To him, compromises were often preferable to principles and agreements were preferable to content.\n\nOne could say that everything Rutte does is functional. Asked whether he has a vision, one of his former advisors told me: \"No. I don't remember him rejecting one piece of advice I gave him, in all those years, ever. For vision, he would say, you visit an eye doctor.\"\n\nAnother tactic that Rutte uses often is to never set himself a deadline, instead letting time do its work whenever possible. He seems to have done exactly this with his NATO candidacy, moving cautiously to de-mine the road ahead and forcing Stoltenberg to accept an extension of his mandate from Oct. 1, 2023, to a new end date in October 2024. Some feared in recent weeks that it would have to be extended yet again, into 2025.\n\nFor Rutte, there was only one NATO-related deadline, a personal one: July 2023, when, to general surprise, he pulled the rug from underneath his fourth government following a clash over asylum policies. For many, it was a strange spectacle for a man known for bending over backwards to save his governments from collapsing, including on migration issues. This time, he suddenly confronted his coalition partners with an ultimatum for an agreement on family reunification for asylum-seekers, a relatively minor issue.\n\nWeirder still was that when an agreement was within reach, Rutte got very annoyed, dug in, and then dissolved the government. Others were stunned: This was both unnecessary and very unlike him.\n\nFor once, apparently, Rutte actually wanted the government to fall. During the drawn-out period during which elections would be held and negotiations organized to form a new government, he would continue to run the country as a caretaker -- and meanwhile, he would be campaigning and diplomatically de-mining the long and winding road to the NATO job. It was vintage Rutte. He had it all planned and mapped out in advance.\n\nInsiders in The Haguetold me Rutte initially wanted to become president of the European Commission. That story did the rounds in Brussels, too, for several years. But in 2019, other European Union heads of state and government asked him to become president of the European Council, which represents member states in Brussels. Rutte said no. The country still needed him, he argued. He also considered it a part-time job. The 26 member states (the UK was technically still a member but did not take part in the decision-making) then appointed liberal Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel instead, a decision that many came to regret afterwards because he is not seen as very effective.\n\nThe presidency of the European Commission, which basically runs the EU, is extremely demanding. Former German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen got the job in December 2019, as her party -- the main center-right political grouping in Europe -- finished first in that year's European elections. This year, the center right won again. Rutte's political family, the liberals, lost many seats and would never have been in a position to claim this post. This is why von der Leyen is running again, for a second mandate, and Rutte never made a pitch.\n\nBecause of the war in Ukraine, which Russia frames as a war with the West, the top job at NATO seems increasingly challenging. It is probably more suitable for Rutte than an EU job. Rutte comes from a country that is totally focused on trans-Atlantic, not European relations. Dutch career politicians speak English, not French. They tend to call the EU \"a market,\" preferring to ignore its political origins and nature. As I saw first-hand in Brussels, Rutte felt uneasy at EU summits during his first years as a prime minister. That only changed in 2016, when then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked him -- when the Netherlands had the six-month EU presidency -- to convince other EU leaders to accept a migration deal that she was preparing with Turkey.\n\nRutte went to work, doing what he does best: talking to people, shaking hands, cementing relationships, and getting the job done. He did get it done. The agreement, committing Europe to take up to 200,000 Syrian refugees from Turkey in exchange for Ankara's help blocking illegal crossings into Europe, was and still is much criticized. But people who work with Rutte agree this was the first time they ever saw him enjoy EU deal-making.\n\nRutte, however, has a thick skin: Since his professional persona is so dominant, he rarely takes criticism personally. Very carefully massaging Erdogan and Orban toward accepting him without making excuses became his new mission. Traveling all over the world to lobby peers and explore ways to overcome the hurdles towards the NATO job, Rutte visibly got back some of the enthusiasm and drive that he once had as a young prime minister but had lost by his fourth, most difficult government.\n\nHe had become tired of being prime minister, and the country had gotten tired of him. A housing crisis, rising environmental and economic problems, and a nasty social child benefits scandal that hit some of the poorest and most disadvantaged in the country -- these and other issues were too profound and serious to be managed away with yet another round of Ruttian compromise-making. A fresh look at things was required in the Netherlands -- and perhaps more structural solutions were required, too.\n\nIn Brussels, interestingly, one hears very little concern about Rutte's capability to run NATO. Even Donald Trump, when he was the U.S. president, approvingly said of him: \"I like this guy.\" Rutte knows what is at stake for the alliance. Under his tenure as prime minister, Russian forces shot down the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 with 298 people on board, of whom 196 were Dutch, in the summer of 2014. Rutte, who was on one of his ritual short holidays when it happened, flew to The Hague immediately and started to manage one of the largest crises of his tenure.\n\nAt first, because of the element of surprise and chaos and the total lack of cooperation by the Russian authorities, he became extremely angry. But when he calmed down, he got to work: He formed a team, assigned tasks, offered comfort, and tried to control the situation. Many political insiders who worked with him say he did this well. Rutte, a staunch Ukraine supporter, knows by now what Russian President Vladimir Putin is capable of and how serious the challenges to Europe's defense and security have become and may yet become.\n\nThe hardest thing to imagine is not Rutte being surprised by the strategic challenges that he is about to face, nor the chairing of endless meetings with 32 hardheaded ambassadors, week after week. No, the hardest thing to imagine is Rutte living in the gated community in Brussels where NATO secretary-generals are generally housed.\n\nDe directeur, in an elegant, colonial townhouse, with a cleaning lady and a cook and a handful of bodyguards, locked up behind a thick, wrought-iron gate.

At the last annual Munich Security Conference, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\" as he called for increased defense spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election.\n\n\"An undervalued characteristic of his profile that should potentially be of oversized value is his good rapport with Donald Trump should he regain the White House,\" Hilton told Newsweek. \"By accounts, Rutte played a pivotal role in rescuing the 2018 NATO Leaders' Summit,\" he said. \"His ability to shrewdly navigate a Trump White House 2.0 will be of existential importance for NATO and Ukraine.\"\n\nThe chances of Rutte, 57, replacing Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down in October, have increased after Hungary and Slovakia indicated on Monday they would back his nomination to lead the 32-state alliance. Romania, whose president Klaus Iohannis is also a contender, is the only member opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\n\"I'm not expecting any dramatic change under Rutte. He's an astute, experienced, polished and exceptionally well-connected political operator who is well-versed in finding and following the political weather within the alliance,\" John Foreman, former British defense attache to Moscow and Kyiv, told Newsweek.\n\n\"Given his backing came originally from the U.S. and Germany, I don't expect him to be quite as outspoken as Stoltenberg on supporting Ukraine and he will probably follow the D.C. line,\" said Foreman.\n\n\"He has become more hawkish on Russia over recent years,\" Foreman added. \"Personally I don't think he is the best choice -- another western European male -- but he was the least offensive candidate to all parties.\"\n\nRutte took office as Netherlands' prime minister in 2010 and during his tenure has dealt with the aftermath of the downed MH17 airliner over Ukraine in 2014 that his country blamed on Russia, in which 196 of the 298 victims were Dutch.\n\nIn September 2022, seven months after Putin started his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rutte told the United Nations that the Russian president \"won't stop at Ukraine, if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself.\"\n\nHe said in April \"don't mentally underestimate Putin\" and in his encounters with the Russian leader he concluded that \"he's not a strong man.\"\n\nHilton said Rutte as NATO chief \"should be viewed positively\" by Zelensky and Kyiv and that like Stoltenberg, he is likely to use diplomacy to reassure anxious allies along the eastern flank of NATO.\n\nNewsweek has contacted NATO for comment.\n\nThe Netherlands is leading an international group to provide F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, with whom Rutte has signed a 10-year security pact, guaranteeing Dutch support despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\n\"One area that still remains to be decided is if his appointment will benefit or adversely impact the incoming Dutch collation government,\" said Hilton. \"Until the Cabinet is determined, more time is needed before speculating on what it means for Ukraine and national defense spending.\"",

It's not positive. We have to work something out.\"\n\nMore recently, Rutte displayed more Dutch directness at the Munich Security Conference in February, saying Europe had to work \"with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\n\"All that whining and moaning about Trump -- I hear that constantly over the last couple of days, let's stop doing that,\" he said.\n\n- 'Mr Normal' -\n\nRutte has a \"Mr Normal\" image that could not be further removed from the bling-bling former president.\n\nAs well as cycling to meet foreign leaders, he is known to do his own shopping at the local supermarket and drives himself to meet the king in his humble Saab station wagon.\n\nAnother viral video showed Rutte spilling a cup of coffee at a government building and insisting on mopping it up himself, as cleaning staff applauded and he chuckled at his own clumsiness.\n\nOn Ukraine, the Netherlands signed a deal this year for two billion euros ($2.1 billion) of military assistance over 10 years, later adding an additional one billion.\n\nRutte also spearheaded the push to give Kyiv F-16 fighter jets, a decision described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as \"historic\" on a trip to the Netherlands.\n\n\"Ukraine must win this battle. For their security and ours,\" said Rutte, who is posed to be the fourth Dutchman to lead the NATO alliance.\n\nRutte's 14-year tenure as Dutch PM was marked by the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed.\n\nSpeaking in Paris just two weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rutte described President Vladimir Putin in uncompromising terms: \"cold-hearted, brutal, merciless.\"\n\n- 'Mr. No' -\n\nAs the second longest-serving EU leader after Hungary's Viktor Orban, Rutte's diplomatic skills came to the fore as he toured NATO capitals to drum up support.\n\nHe finally wore down main holdouts Turkey and Hungary, the latter still angry at Rutte, who said Budapest should not be in the EU after it passed a law banning the promotion of LGBTQ content to minors.\n\nRutte also infuriated some southern European countries with his hard line on bailouts, earning him yet another soubriquet: \"Mr. No.\"\n\nDomestically, he was tainted by many scandals, with the sudden collapse of his coalition last year over an asylum row sparking elections that resulted in victory for far-right leader Geert Wilders.\n\nArguably the most damaging came in 2021 when his government was forced to resign after thousands of parents -- many from ethnic minority backgrounds -- were falsely accused of childcare subsidy fraud.\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Rutte's father Izaak was a trader, while his mother Mieke was the sister of Izaak's first wife, who died in a Japanese internment camp in World War II.\n\nHe initially wanted to be a concert pianist, but after attending the prestigious Leiden University, he joined Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever, including a stint at its peanut butter division, Calve.\n\nHe describes himself as a \"man of habit and tradition\" who has spent his whole life in The Hague and volunteers as a teacher.\n\nHis public image is perhaps best summed up by his regular hairdresser, Marco Rimmelzwaan, who said that \"Mark doesn't like change, he always wants the same thing.\"\n\nbur-ric/jm\n\nMore from this section\n\nOne Man's Tragedy Becomes a Treasure:

Romanian President Klaus Iohannis informed the military alliance he was withdrawing his bid at the end of last week, his office said on Thursday. The two had been vying to replace the incumbent Jens Stoltenberg, whose term expires in October. While Mr Rutte is the only remaining candidate in the race, he is yet to be officially confirmed by member states. Mr Rutte, 57, will inherit overseeing Nato's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as the job of maintaining the US's commitment to the alliance if Donald Trump - who has previously expressed reticence about American involvement - is re-elected as president.Mr Stoltenberg has been credited with dealing positively with Mr Trump in the past. He told a security conference in February that Europe should work \"with whoever is on the dance floor\", according to AFP.Mr Rutte put his hat in the ring for Nato's top job after saying he would leave politics in wake of the collapse of his coalition government last summer. His successor, Dick Schoof, was nominated by the new Dutch coalition partners at the end of May, paving the way for Mr Rutte to step down.Mr Rutte's support of Ukraine and his 14 year-stint at the top of European politics earned him candidacy endorsement from many Nato members, including key players in the UK, US, France and Germany.However, three member nations - Hungary, Romania and Turkey - initially held out.After expressing reservations, Turkey said it would support Mr Rutte's bid after the Dutch PM travelled there in April to speak to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Associated Press reported at the time.On Tuesday, Hungary - whose g ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Romania", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Romania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

At the last annual Munich Security Conference, Rutte said leaders should stop \"moaning and whining about Trump\" as he called for increased defense spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election.\n\n\"An undervalued characteristic of his profile that should potentially be of oversized value is his good rapport with Donald Trump should he regain the White House,\" Hilton told Newsweek. \"By accounts, Rutte played a pivotal role in rescuing the 2018 NATO Leaders' Summit,\" he said. \"His ability to shrewdly navigate a Trump White House 2.0 will be of existential importance for NATO and Ukraine.\"\n\nThe chances of Rutte, 57, replacing Jens Stoltenberg, who steps down in October, have increased after Hungary and Slovakia indicated on Monday they would back his nomination to lead the 32-state alliance. Romania, whose president Klaus Iohannis is also a contender, is the only member opposed to Rutte's candidacy.\n\n\"I'm not expecting any dramatic change under Rutte. He's an astute, experienced, polished and exceptionally well-connected political operator who is well-versed in finding and following the political weather within the alliance,\" John Foreman, former British defense attache to Moscow and Kyiv, told Newsweek.\n\n\"Given his backing came originally from the U.S. and Germany, I don't expect him to be quite as outspoken as Stoltenberg on supporting Ukraine and he will probably follow the D.C. line,\" said Foreman.\n\n\"He has become more hawkish on Russia over recent years,\" Foreman added. \"Personally I don't think he is the best choice -- another western European male -- but he was the least offensive candidate to all parties.\"\n\nRutte took office as Netherlands' prime minister in 2010 and during his tenure has dealt with the aftermath of the downed MH17 airliner over Ukraine in 2014 that his country blamed on Russia, in which 196 of the 298 victims were Dutch.\n\nIn September 2022, seven months after Putin started his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Rutte told the United Nations that the Russian president \"won't stop at Ukraine, if we don't stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself.\"\n\nHe said in April \"don't mentally underestimate Putin\" and in his encounters with the Russian leader he concluded that \"he's not a strong man.\"\n\nHilton said Rutte as NATO chief \"should be viewed positively\" by Zelensky and Kyiv and that like Stoltenberg, he is likely to use diplomacy to reassure anxious allies along the eastern flank of NATO.\n\nNewsweek has contacted NATO for comment.\n\nThe Netherlands is leading an international group to provide F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, with whom Rutte has signed a 10-year security pact, guaranteeing Dutch support despite criticism by far-right leader and election-winner Geert Wilders.\n\n\"One area that still remains to be decided is if his appointment will benefit or adversely impact the incoming Dutch collation government,\" said Hilton. \"Until the Cabinet is determined, more time is needed before speculating on what it means for Ukraine and national defense spending.\"",

It was a good and open conversation and the two agreed to focus on the future,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nA Hungarian government spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nStoltenberg told Orb\u00e1n last week that Hungary could opt out of Nato activities to support Ukraine, such as a plan for the alliance to take more control of military supplies to Kyiv and training of Ukrainian troops, as well as long-term financial support.\n\n\"I think that's a good solution that will enable us to move forward on more support for Ukraine within the Nato framework without Hungary blocking,\" Stoltenberg said at the time.\n\nIn the meeting between Rutte and Orb\u00e1n on Monday evening, which took place as the EU's 27 leaders discussed who would fill the bloc's top jobs for the next five years, the Dutch prime minister did not apologise for past remarks about Orb\u00e1n at Brussels summits, one of the people briefed on the discussions said.\n\nRutte has clashed with Orb\u00e1n over the latter's hardline views on homosexuality and Hungary's judicial reforms.\n\nThe Dutch prime minister, who is likely to leave office in July after a new government is formed in The Hague, already has the backing of US President Joe Biden for the post of Nato secretary-general.\n\nIn addition to Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, whose president Klaus Iohannis has campaigned for the Nato job, have yet to publicly back him.\n\nRutte said the planned new Dutch government, which involves his liberal party but also far-right leader Geert Wilders, would continue to support Ukraine.\n\n\"When it comes to

It should allow NATO to put on a show of unity and demonstrate solidarity with war-ravaged Ukraine when U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterparts meet in Washington on July 9-11 to mark NATO's 75th birthday.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kion546.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "dateEnd": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 680, "textEnd": 689}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

He\u2019s a close friend and colleague.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s return could pose one major challenge \u2013 to Nato\u2019s east Rutte will face the far more pressing menace from Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s forces are currently on the front foot in Ukraine after more than two years of brutal conflict, and the Nato chief will have a key role marshalling aid from Kyiv\u2019s weary backers.\n\nAt the same time Rutte will have to ensure the alliance is ready to defend against any potential future attack from Moscow \u2013 if, or more likely when, Putin is able to rebuild his forces.\n\nPart of that will involve corralling European allies to spend more on defence \u2013 a key demand from Trump, and other US leaders.\n\nThis week Nato announced that 23 out of its 32 member countries had hit the alliance\u2019s target of spending two per cent of their gross domestic product on defence.\n\nDubbed \u201cTeflon Mark\u201d for his ability to remain in power for so long in the Netherlands, Rutte will become the fourth Dutchman to lead Nato since it emerged from the ashes of World War II to confront the Soviet Union.\n\nThe bicycling conservative threw his country\u2019s economic weight behind Ukraine in the wake of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion \u2013 leading efforts to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nWhile Nato countries along the alliance\u2019s eastern flank had pushed for one of their own to get the Nato job, Rutte\u2019s backers insist he is fully aware of the threat posed by Russia.\n\nAmong the most formative events during his time in charge of the Netherlands was the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, with 196 Dutch among the 298 killed, that was blamed of Moscow-backed fighters.",

However, Spain is at the bottom of this list, being the allied country that allocates the least percentage of its GDP to defence, with just 1.28%.\n\nIt is far from the target set by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance. Other countries lagging behind are Canada, Belgium, Luxembourg and Slovenia. In contrast, the allies that spend the most are Poland (4.12%), Estonia (3.43%) and the United States (3.38%). The data provided by the Atlantic Alliance show a rearmament of allied countries following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has led Nato to double its military spending this year to 17.9%.\n\nIn his meeting with US President Joe Biden, Stoltenberg said \"this is the biggest increase in decades\", which shows Natomember states are \"stepping up\" and \"taking responsibility\". The Norwegian has already expressed on numerous occasions his intentions for the 2% spending to be considered \"a floor and not a ceiling\".\n\nThe military alliance is trying to pave the way for its Washington summit, to be held from 9 to 11 July. The summit will be used to appoint the next Nato secretary general to replace Stoltenberg, with Hungary announcing on Tuesday it will support the candidacy of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Viktor Orb\u00e1n announced he will back Rutte's aspirations, after the latter assured him in a letter he would respect Budapest's decision not to participate in the support for Ukraine.\n\nThe two leaders met on the sidelines of Monday's informal meeting of European Union (EU) leaders in Brussels. Rutte also met with the leaders of Romania and Slovakia, the other two allies who had not yet endorsed his candidacy for Nato chief.\n\nIn the Hungarian case, part of his rejection of Rutte stemmed from the Dutch Prime Minister's remarks about Hungarian regulations banning lectures on homosexuality in schools, which Orb\u00e1n considered an insult.\n\nIn his letter on Tuesday, Rutte pointed out Hungary's \"valuable\" role in the military alliance as a stabiliser in the region and acknowledged the country's work in the war in Ukraine, taking in thousands of refugees. He also said he will respect the pact between Stoltenberg and Orb\u00e1n to exempt Hungary from participating in military and economic support for Kiev.\n\nOrb\u00e1n's response was swift: \"Hungary is ready to support Prime Minister Rutte's candidacy for Nato secretary general,\" the Hungarian leader said. On Tuesday, Slovakia announced it will also back the Dutch Prime Minister as the next Nato secretary general. As a result, leaders are gradually closing ranks around Rutte, who is the most widely supported contender for Nato secretary general.", "source": {"uri": "surinenglish.com", "dataType": "news",

As Nato approaches what could be the riskiest moment in its history, the military alliance's next leader could determine the future of the world.\n\nDutch media reports that the Netherlands' longest-serving Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, will be Mr Stoltenberg's successor, after Hungary and Slovakia backed him.\n\nWhile Mr Rutte is not yet confirmed as head of the Brussels-based alliance, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis is expected to announce on Thursday that he is exiting the race. The other key contender, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, is seen by some as too hawkish over Russia.\n\nMr Rutte, 57, has two nicknames. One, \"Teflon Mark\", refers to his talent for surviving scandals and crises that would sink lesser politicians. The other, more recent, is the \"Trump whisperer\", from his rare ability to cajole the once and perhaps future US president.\n\n\"Keeping the family together, figuring out compromises, travelling around the capitals and keeping everybody onside have now become the key to the Nato job,\" says Jamie Shea, senior fellow at the Friends of Europe think-tank and former Nato spokesman. \"Rutte ticks all the boxes. He knows everybody. He can pick up the phone, he can call people. He's got all the international contacts.\"\n\nThe challenges for Nato are enormous. War has returned to Europe and tensions are rising from the Middle East to the South China Sea. The alliance is not only supporting Ukraine's defence against Russia, but battling Russian cyberwarfare and disinformation.\n\nYet the biggest threat could come from within. The prospect of a second Donald Trump presidency after November's US elections has sent shivers through Nato. He has regularly threatened to pull the US from the alliance, and this year even said he'd \"encourage\" Russia to attack member countries that do not meet defence spending targets.\n\nIf Trump does return to the White House, Mr Rutte is seen as the best advocate to placate him.\n\nMr Rutte is credited with rescuing a July 2018 Nato summit that risked descending into acrimony, with Trump warning that US might \"go our own way\" if allies did not increase defence spending.\n\nThe 6ft 4in Dutchman, just slightly taller than the then-president, assured the US leader that spending had gone up, and crucially, credited Trump for it (this was a stretch: it had been rising for a decade).\n\nThat same month, he publicly contradicted Trump in the Oval Office, when the President suggested that a failure to resolve a trade dispute with the EU could be \"positive\". Smiling genially, Mr Rutte interjected: \"No, it's not positive... We have to work something out!\"\n\nDisarmed by the response, Trump said, \"I like this guy!\"\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference this year, Mr Rutte, an instinctive Atlanticist, pushed back against fretting over the US elections. \"Stop moaning and whining and nagging about Trump,\" he said. \"We have to work with whoever is on the dance floor.\"\n\nIan Lesser, the Brussels-based vice-president of the think-tank German Marshall Fund of the US, says: \"Whatever the result of the American election, it's vital that Nato has a Secretary-General with access in Washington and a style that allows him or her to engage with the next president.\"\n\nMr Stoltenberg was similarly dubbed the \"Trump whisperer\" for his ability to manage the prickly American president when he threatened to pull the US out of Nato. If Trump returns, Nato's head will need to demonstrate shrewd political instincts and supreme coaxing skills.\n\n\"Assuming it's him, Rutte will bring stability and predictability. He'll bring access, he'll bring credibility on both sides of the Atlantic,\" says Dr Lesser.\n\nLike Trump, Mr Rutte has a business background, as former human resources manager at Unilever. He also shares the American's ability to connect with ordinary people - arguably with more authenticity than the billionaire real estate mogul.\n\nThe Dutchman is a creature of habit, living in the same apartment in The Hague since he became Prime Minister, persisting with the same old Nokia phone, driving a battered 2009 Saab, and stopping for a cappuccino at the same caf\u00e9.\n\n\"Rutte has this ability to talk to people whatever their background, which is a skill that really shouldn't be underestimated,\" says Rem Korteweg of the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think-tank. \"He's charming, he is engaging, he is pragmatic and he can bring people together. He's a bridge-builder.\"\n\nHe is famously down-to-earth, cycling to the royal palace to be sworn in, and teaching a weekly social studies class at a mostly immigrant high school. In 2018, he was filmed accidentally dropping his coffee in the Dutch parliament - but instead of having someone clean up the mess on the floor, he found a mop and did it himself.\n\nMr Rutte, from the centre-right VVD party, is known for his negotiating skills in cobbling together several Dutch coalition governments since 2010. A cheerful pragmatist who baulks at talk of visions, he has forged friendships with key leaders across political divides in the Netherlands, Europe and globally.\n\nThe second-longest sitting leader in Europe after Hungary's Mr Orb\u00e1n, Mr Rutte is the youngest of six children. He has headed the Dutch government in a caretaker capacity since last November's election. A new coalition has yet to be finalised, but is expected well before October.\n\nThe US, Britain, France, Germany and at least 25 other countries out of the 32-member alliance have already publicly supported him.\n\nHungary had repeatedly voiced staunch opposition to the candidacy of Mr Rutte, a long-time critic of the Budapest government, particularly its anti-LGBT legislation, who said the country \"has no business being in the European Union anymore\".\n\nThis week, Hungary dropped its opposition, clearing Mr Rutte's path to taking the top job, after he gave written guarantees that he would not force it to take part in Nato's plans for further support to Ukraine.\n\nThere is no timetable for the appointment, but it is expected before the 75-anniversary summit in Washington in July.\n\nOfficials are keen to avoid the decision leaking into the haggling for top international jobs after June's European Parliament elections.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType":

Zakharova explained that the NATO secretary general \"is nominal in terms of his political influence.\"\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed at a press conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Washington that the alliance is close to appointing a new secretary general. He called acting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte a strong candidate.\n\nThe Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS) reported on June 18, citing sources, that Rutte will become the new NATO secretary general. According to them, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who is Rutte's only rival, will withdraw his candidacy in the near future.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_(news_agency)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sputnik (news agency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Zakharova", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria Zakharova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Netherlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the Netherlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Romania", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Romania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rutte", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Rutte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Omroep_Stichting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nederlandse Omroep Stichting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660790", "eventUri": "eng-9660790", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 202, "textEnd": 209}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1022, "textEnd": 1029}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

However, two notable aspects remain of the president's candidacy. The first is already known: the situational, hardly honorable alliance with Viktor Orban. The second will soon be revealed: what Iohannis obtained for himself or for Romania from this political game.\n\nI wrote as early as May that the president entered the NATO race alone, without the support of strategic partners, and delayed the entire process of appointing the new Secretary General, irritating everyone. He took all of Romania's allies by surprise. Only one foreign actor played along with Iohannis, just to achieve his own objectives: Viktor Orban.\n\nOrban stuck to Klaus Iohannis from the beginning of the year because he sensed the Romanian president's weakness. He campaigned in Transylvania all year for the UDMR (the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania) without Romanian authorities warning him about his anti-EU and anti-NATO deviations, as had happened in previous years.\n\nA very relevant statement by Orban on June 2 in Salonta (a town in Romania), when he publicly said that Romanian authorities have no reason to criticize him for attacks on the EU because he is willing to support Iohannis for NATO leadership: \"The Romanian government has no reason to criticize us because we are saying something different here than they are because in the two most important national goals of Romania, today the Hungarian government supports the Romanian government. We don't need to prove our good faith after this position, because for the position of NATO Secretary General, we are capable and willing to support the President of Romania.\"\n\nIndeed, neither the government nor the Presidential Administration warned Orban, despite the lies and manipulations continuously poured into the heads of Romanian voters of Hungarian ethnicity.\n\nWhat a difference from two years ago when President Iohannis publicly criticized Viktor Orban for his anti-European statements made in B\u0103ile Tu\u0219nad (a town in Romania).\n\n\"It is regrettable that a high-ranking European dignitary comes to the public stage with an anti-European discourse. It is erroneous, wrong, unacceptable regardless of where this stage is, the fact that this stage was in Transylvania is a problem for us,\" Klaus Iohannis said in 2022 after Orban's outbursts.\n\nOrban's speech has not changed one bit since then. On the contrary, the Hungarian leader has accelerated his anti-Western outbursts. But Klaus Iohannis has turned 180 degrees. He accepted all of Orban's deviations even in Romania. He remained silent when Viktor Orban grossly manipulated Romanian citizens of Hungarian ethnicity regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He calmly watched as propaganda from Budapest created one of Romania's biggest problems: brainwashing nearly one million Romanian citizens who have come to believe more in the lies of Russia and Hungary than in the official policy of the Romanian state, the EU, and NATO.\n\nWhy did President Iohannis remain complicitly silent? Because he hoped Orban would block Mark Rutte in the NATO race, thus paving the way for the Romanian candidate. It didn't matter that Orban was the kind of support nobody wants, an obstructionist who broke Western solidarity and blocked crucial decisions for Ukraine's survival.\n\nRelevant to the president's silence is also the 2023 CSAT (Supreme Council of National Defense) report, which praises the relationship with Hungary despite Viktor Orban's revisionist rhetoric: \"Positive and substantial results, marked by discussions focused on concrete and substantive projects.\"\n\nObviously, Orban played both sides. Today, after obtaining a concession from Mark Rutte for Hungary, the Hungarian Prime Minister supports the Dutchman. President Iohannis seems to have been left offside because Slovakia, another problematic state in the Russia-Ukraine dossier, has announced that it is backing Rutte.\n\nIt is very likely that there was no explicit agreement between Klaus Iohannis and Viktor Orban, but each played their own political game. But whether involuntary or not, the association of the Romanian president with Putin's puppet is a political mistake. The coming weeks will show whether Iohannis secured a position in the EU, possibly a very well-paid one, following his game with NATO. And whether it was worth staying silent in the face of an Orban who did whatever he wanted in Transylvania.\n\nPS: Note the total opacity in the way President Iohannis negotiated his position. While other leaders publicly stated their negotiation objectives, Iohannis rejected any questions from the media on this topic. Thus ends the term of the most non-transparent president of Romania in the last two decades.", "source": {"uri": "g4media.ro", "dataType": "news", "title": "G4Media.ro"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Allies have been hoping to settle on a next secretary-general by the time of Nato leaders' summit in Washington in July. The decision comes at a critical time with anxiety in Europe about the potential return of former US president Donald Trump -- an outspoken critic of the organisation.\n\nThe backing of Hungary and Slovakia left Romania -- which is fielding its own candidate for Nato's top job, President Klaus Iohannis -- as the only nation that has yet to formally back the Dutch leader, though it's expected to do so.\n\nRomanian officials in April said the nation would not block the election of the next Nato chief, as long as Rutte makes clear commitments to eastern European security priorities and progress is made on better regional representation inside the alliance.\n\nGermany launched a task force to counter disinformation campaigns by countries including Russia that the government in Berlin says are designed to undermine democracy and sow discord.\n\nWith the creation of the new unit, Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling coalition is taking the next step in implementing conclusions from its inaugural national security strategy published last year, which singled out the Kremlin as the principal menace to Germany's security.\n\nThe task force, a joint initiative of the interior, foreign and justice ministries, will start its work with 10 dedicated analysts and the number of staff is set to double to 20 charged with monitoring and analysis.\n\nThe focus will be on detecting and debunking disinformation operations on social media, including those allegedly sponsored by the Kremlin. One example is the \"Doppelganger\" campaign, which generated more than a million posts on X from tens of thousands of fake accounts within a few weeks, according to the German government.\n\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser said the security situation in Germany \"remains tense\", due both to the \"brutal Russian war of aggression against Ukraine\" and \"the terrible escalations in the Middle East\".\n\n\"The threat to our democracy from espionage, sabotage, disinformation and cyber attacks has reached a new dimension,\" Faeser said on Tuesday as she presented the latest annual report from Germany's domestic intelligence agency.\n\nAs well as an increase in both right- and left-wing extremist criminal offences, there was also a big jump in crimes motivated by anti-Semitism, according to the report.\n\n\"We must break the spiral in which escalations in the Middle East lead to even more repugnant hatred of Jews in our country,\" Faeser said.\n\nAnother aim of the new disinformation task force is to preempt and defuse the campaigns before they take off, a tactic known as \"prebunking,\" the government said.\n\nIt also wants to make the operators of social media platforms such as X and Facebook more accountable and increase the pressure -- if necessary also with sanctions -- so that fake accounts and disinformation campaigns are removed more rapidly.\n\nUkrainians' opposition to concessions in talks with Russia has diminished in the last two years, though most people believe that Volodymyr Zelensky should remain president until the end of martial law, a new poll shows.\n\nA majority of Ukrainians still rule out making compromises in negotiations with Russia, but the share has decreased to 58% from 80% in May 2022, according to the survey, which was conducted fro 26 May to 1 June by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. A total of 30% of respondents didn't agree with the idea of opposing compromises, the study showed.\n\nWhile Kyiv has secured billions of dollars in fresh Western aid to repel Vladimir Putin's invasion, Kremlin forces have been battering Ukraine's energy sector, and an effort by Zelensky to gain more international support at the weekend fell short of its aims. The Ukrainian leader has consistently rejected calls made by Moscow to surrender territories since the war began in February 2022.\n\nA total of 65% of respondents indicated that they favoured a referendum on any possible terms of an accord with Russia, according to the survey, which polled 2,011 Ukrainians by phone.\n\nRussia has sought to question the Ukrainian leader's legitimacy since his elected term as head of state officially expired in May. Although support for Zelensky's decisions dropped to 56% from 77% in September, a total of 70% said he should remain president until the end of the period of martial law, the survey showed.\n\nA minority of 34% backed a recent law tightening the rules for conscription, according to the study.\n\nRead more: Ukraine's mobilisation campaign saps wartime economy's workforce\n\nA former professor at an Estonian university was sentenced to six years in prison for espionage as authorities said he'd been first recruited by Russian intelligence as a student in St Petersburg three decades ago.\n\nViacheslav Morozov, a Russian citizen who taught at the University of Tartu as a professor of international political theory, was found guilty by Harju County Court on Tuesday. He was convicted of collecting information relevant to national security, including individuals and infrastructure.\n\nEstonian authorities sketched out a picture of an accessible academic who parlayed his contacts and conference visits over the years into information that he sold to handlers during frequent visits to Russia for a small fee. Morozov (51), who previously worked at St Petersburg State University, had been an \"inactive agent\" until 2010, when he undertook additional training before moving his academic career to Estonia, the nation's spy agency said.\n\n\"The information he gathered gave a very adequate picture of Estonia's vulnerabilities,\" Margo Palloson, chief of the Estonian Internal Security Service, told reporters. The intelligence could ultimately be used to plan Russian military aggression against Estonia, he said.\n\nAs European governments have increasingly moved against alleged Russian espionage networks, Estonia, which gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, has aggressively sought to uncover and prosecute individuals working for Russia's security services.\n\nThe Baltic nation's vocal support for Ukraine and criticism of Russia has made it a target of Moscow, which has intensified efforts against the country with espionage, cyberattacks and sabotage attempts.\n\nRead more: Russian sabotage, spying and intimidation spread in Europe\n\nRussia's largest private lender, sanctioned by both the US and the European Union, is planning to open new offices in China after it expanded client support services for Chinese businesses.\n\nAlfa Bank, controlled by sanctioned billionaire Mikhail Fridman and his partners, is applying to Chinese authorities to open branches in Beijing and Shanghai, according to a statement from the bank on Tuesday. It said it was already providing services to \"thousands of Chinese companies\" that work with Russia and had launched a website and support for Chinese-speaking clients.\n\nThe US, the EU and its allies have sanctioned Russia's key lenders since the start of the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The US imposed blocking penalties against Alfa Bank shortly after the war began, while the EU added the lender to its sanctioned list last year.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's endorsement, conditioned on Rutte's commitment to Hungary's non-involvement in NATO operations in Ukraine, has been pivotal in removing the last significant obstacle to his appointment.Rutte's potential ascension to NATO's top post has elicited varied reactions, with some expressing cautious optimism while others remain deeply skeptical. Mikael Valtersson, a former officer of Swedish Armed Forces/Air Defence, former defence politician and chief of staff with Sweden Democrats, provides a perspective on Rutte's suitability for the role.Valtersson argues that Rutte's tenure as Prime Minister has been marked by a rigid stance on military support to Ukraine, trait that does not bode well for a role that requires diplomatic finesse and a balanced approach to global security challenges.Rutte's critics contend that his leadership could exacerbate existing tensions rather than foster dialogue and de-escalation.A Leader of War, Not Peace?Rutte's track record reflects a staunchly pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian stance. Under his leadership, the Netherlands has committed substantial financial aid to Ukraine, including \u20ac3 billion annually for 2024 and 2025. The Netherlands has also been at the forefront of supplying Ukraine with military hardware, notably the F-16 fighter jets, reinforcing Rutte's hawkish posture.In March 2024, Rutte signed a significant security treaty with Ukraine, a move that underscores his commitment to Ukraine's defense but also raises questions about the appropriateness of such actions by a caretaker government. This treaty, signed despite the electoral victory of right-wing Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, highlights Rutte's prioritization of support for Ukraine over the potential policy shifts anticipated from the new government.Critics argue that Rutte's actions indicate a preference for military solutions over diplomatic engagement. His strong backing for Ukraine and consistent alignment with NATO's hardline stance against Russia suggest that his leadership would likely continue Stoltenberg's pro-Ukraine policies without exploring avenues for peace or compromise.A Missed Opportunity for NATO?Valtersson and other critics suggest that Rutte's appointment represents a missed opportunity for NATO to choose a leader who could steer the alliance towards a more nuanced and peaceful approach to the Ukraine conflict and broader global tensions.The concern is that Rutte's leadership will perpetuate a cycle of military escalation rather than fostering diplomatic resolutions.As NATO prepares to finalize its decision, it must take into consideration, that, while Rutte's candidacy has garnered support from key NATO members, his track record and recent commitments raise legitimate concerns about his capacity to lead the alliance towards a more balanced and peaceful global strategy.", "source": {"uri":

That strategy may not work in a second term.\n\n\"Trump, and some people around him, won't be tricked a second time,\" said FABRICE POTHIER, who served as former NATO Secretary General ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN's policy chief.\n\nKAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, who served as ambassador to NATO under Trump, told NatSec Daily that Trump's relationship with the alliance could be determined by who he appoints as defense and state secretaries.\n\nDaalder said Trump may appoint a greater number of NATO-skeptics to top administrative posts if he wins in November.\n\n\"The first term was different,\" said Daalder, noting that many of those who served in Trump's top defense and national security roles were \"traditional pro-alliance people.\"\n\n\"If RIC GRENELL is secretary of state or if, god forbid, JARED KUSHNER -- they don't care about, they don't understand and they don't want to understand NATO,\" he added.\n\nBut regardless of who influences Trump's stance on NATO, don't expect Rutte to adopt Stoltenberg's conciliatory approach to the former president.\n\n\"Yes, he will try to figure out a way to work with the United States, but that only works if the United States wants to work with NATO -- and there's not a lot of evidence that's going to be the case,\" Daalder said.\n\nThe Trump campaign has revealed little about how he would approach NATO under Rutte, saying that Trump \"will restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage.\"\n\nSUBTLE SHIFTS ON UKRAINE: The U.S. has told Ukraine it can use American-supplied weapons to hit any Russian forces attacking from across the border -- not just those in the region near Kharkiv, our own LARA SELIGMAN reports.\n\nThe subtle shift in messaging first appeared in a PBS interview with national security adviser JAKE SULLIVAN, who said the agreement with Ukraine about firing American weapons into Russia extends to \"anywhere that Russian forces are coming across the border from the Russian side to the Ukrainian side to try to take additional Ukrainian territory.\"\n\nTwo U.S. officials maintained that the rhetorical change does not represent a change in policy and that the initial decision was simply characterized in context of Russia's attacks on the city of Kharkiv.\n\nWHAT TO DO ABOUT HAMAS: Israel is continuing its campaign in southern and central Gaza, battering refugee camps and sending its tanks deeper into the city of Rafah, according to Reuters' NIDAL AL-MUGHRABI.\n\nIsraeli planes struck a house in the Al-Nuseirat camp and tanks shelled parts of two other historic refugee camps in the Gaza Strip Wednesday night. But Israeli military leadership is now publicly butting heads with Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, warning that it will be impossible to defeat the militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, according to The Wall Street Journal's JARED MALSIN and ANAT PELED.\n\n\"The idea that we can destroy Hamas or make Hamas disappear is misleading to the public,\" military spokesman DANIEL HAGARI told Israeli television on Wednesday night.\n\nAsked about the growing tensions between Israel's military and its political leaders, National Security Council spokesperson JOHN KIRBY punted at a press gaggle today, saying that the White House does not \"see any impact of these tensions on our shared objective, getting all the hostages out, getting this deal in place, getting a ceasefire in place, and trying to find a way to end the war.\"\n\nHEZBOLLAH TALKS TOUGH: Meanwhile on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah is warning that it has more advanced capabilities that will allow it to hold its own against the Israeli military, according to the Associated Press' KAREEM CHEHAYEB and ABBY SEWELL.\n\n\"We now have new weapons. But I won't say what they are,\" the group's leader HASSAN NASRALLAH claimed in a televised address commemorating a top Hezbollah commander who was killed in southern Lebanon by an Israeli air strike last week. \"When the decision is made, they will be seen on the front lines.\"\n\nThe White House is eager to avoid a second front breaking out in Israel's war, as tensions mount between Israel and Hezbollah and skirmishes occur at the border with Lebanon. \"I would just tell you that we still don't want to see a second front open up,\" spokesperson Kirby said.\n\nTop allies of the administration on Capitol Hill are voicing confidence that the White House will help prevent conflict from escalating further. Sen. CHRIS COONS (D-Del.) told NatSec Daily today that \"we have a very capable ambassador\" in AMOS HOCHSTEIN.\n\nKIM + PUTIN = BFFS FOREVER: Putin and North Korean leader KIM JONG-UN are pledging to provide each other's countries with immediate military assistance if faced with a foreign invasion, according to Reuters' JACK KIM and JU-MIN PARK.\n\nThe announcement, a major showing of the deepening ties between the two U.S. adversaries, capped off a rare foreign tour for the Russian leader, who is slated to make stops in Vietnam and other countries this week.\n\nBut South Korea has promised to respond in kind to the Moscow-Pyongyang lovefest. South Korean newswire Yonhap's KIM EUN-JUNG reported this morning that Seoul is reconsidering its earlier decision not to supply Ukraine with weapons, opening the door to a fresh arms infusion for Kyiv's beleaguered war effort from one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers.\n\nIT'S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to NatSec Daily!

JARED HUFFMAN (D-Calif.) is reacting to Project 2025, a policy roadmap for a possible second Trump administration compiled by the conservative Heritage Foundation. One of the authors of Heritage's 920-page plan is Trump's last acting defense secretary CHRISTOPHER MILLER, who \"wants to fire most of the generals at the Pentagon, slash defense spending by half, shut down the military academies, break up the military-industrial complex,\" according to a March profile.\n\nRep. TED LIEU (D-Calif.), a retired Air Force reserve colonel, told our own JOE GOULD he's worried that gutting the civil service will limit the number of objective professionals at the Pentagon and other key agencies.\n\n\"You would want our Defense Department and national security agencies to take actions based on objective facts, not because you have partisan loyalists stuck into various positions,\" he said. \"It could be quite damaging if you take out people who are skilled professionals and replace them with people who have an agenda.\"\n\nBAD BUSINESS: The Biden administration is banning the sale and update of antivirus software products from Russian cybersecurity giant Kaspersky in the next few months due to cyber espionage concerns, our own MAGGIE MILLER writes in.\n\nThe Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security unveiled a rule Thursday that will ban Kaspersky from entering new agreements with U.S. customers after July 20, and ban the company from issuing software updates for existing products after Sept. 29.\n\nCommerce Secretary GINA RAIMONDO told reporters Thursday that while existing U.S. customers will not be forced to stop using Kaspersky products, they should seriously consider switching due to the degradation of the software with updates banned.\n\nRaimondo also noted that the step, which will essentially blacklist the company and its subsidiaries, was undertaken after a \"thorough investigation\" and after concluding that \"the Russian government's continued augmented cybersecurity ability and capacity\" necessitated the rule.\n\n\"We need to protect Americans and our national security,\" Raimondo said. \"Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent, for exploiting Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans, and that is why we are compelled to take the action we are taking today.\"\n\nSpokespersons for both Kaspersky and the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nREDIRECTING TIME: The administration is moving Ukraine ahead of other countries that were slated to receive air defense missiles, Lara reports.\n\nThe decision, announced by National Security Council spokesperson Kirby at a press gaggle today, is the latest push from Washington to rush urgently needed weapons to Kyiv. It will see Washington \"reprioritize\" deliveries of Patriots and National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems missiles planned for a select group of countries.\n\nDeliveries of interceptors to other countries will be delayed until after Ukraine's inventory is restocked, Kirby said. The administration wants to give Kyiv enough air defense capabilities for the rest of the fiscal year and next fiscal year -- the next 16 months in total, Kirby added.\n\nThat may be tough news for Romania. As our own JOSHUA POSANER reports, Bucharest agreed today to send Ukraine Patriots so long as the U.S. replaced them.\n\nSHORING UP THE GRID: European leaders will call for increased military aid to Kyiv's embattled electric grid in the face of Russian attacks against the country's infrastructure, our own GABRIEL GAVIN and BARBARA MOENS report.\n\nLeaders at next week's European Council summit are expected to approve the transfer of funds earned from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. They will also instruct officials in Brussels to use the cash to provide loans to Ukraine worth \"approximately\" $54 billion \"to support Ukraine's current and future military, budget and reconstruction needs.\"\n\n\"As Ukraine exercises its inherent right to self-defense, the European Council calls for stepping up the delivery of military support to Ukraine,\" it says. \"In particular, air defense systems, ammunition and missiles are urgently needed to protect Ukraine's population and critical energy infrastructure.\"\n\nFIRST IN NATSEC DAILY -- DHS' ISRAELI SCRUTINY: Sen. TOM COTTON (R-Ark.) wants answers from the Department of Homeland Security about its process for screening Israeli citizens who served in the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nIn a letter to Homeland Security Secretary ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, Cotton alleges agents \"are reportedly asking Israelis applying for permanent U.S. resident status detailed questions about their time in the Israeli Defense Forces that go far beyond previous standard inquiries.\"\n\n\"If true, this Administration is expending a disgraceful amount of time, energy, and resources in a thinly veiled attempt to 'prove' IDF members have committed hypothetical war crimes,\" the letter continues.\n\nFIRST IN NATSEC DAILY -- ARMENIA AID CALLS: 21 Democratic Senators are calling on the Biden administration to allocate more humanitarian aid to Armenia to support refugees affected by Azerbaijan's invasion of the contested Nagorno-Karabakh exclave last September.\n\nIn the letter to Biden, the lawmakers, led by Sen. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-R.I.), write that many of the nearly 120,000 refugees who fled the territory \"are in urgent need of assistance, including food, basic staples, cash, housing, mental health counseling and employment aid.\" They add that Armenia may need upwards of $2 billion to adequately provide basic needs to these refugees and call on the administration to release funds to help them in that goal.\n\n'CUBAN NUCLEAR CRISIS IN SPACE': House Intelligence Committee Chair MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio) warned today that the Biden administration is \"sleepwalking into an irreversible 'Day Zero'\" in the face of new nuclear threats in space, Miles reports (for Pros!).\n\nSpeaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Turner said the White House has not done enough to respond to Russia's deployment of nuclear anti-satellite weapons in outer space and called on Biden to declassify \"all available information\" on the threat they pose.\n\nThe administration, he claimed, has not \"done enough to inform ... I firmly believe that the administration is avoiding discussing this topic because they don't want the gap between what they should be doing and what they are doing to be publicly discussed.\"\n\nRussian advances in anti-satellite technology have become a cause celebre for the top Republican on the committee, who raised alarms in February when he hinted publicly that Russia was deploying a new space-based nuclear weapon.\n\nBIBI KEEPS IT GOING: Netanyahu is adding fresh tinder to his fiery spat with the Biden administration over weapons shipments.\n\n\"I am ready to suffer personal attacks provided that Israel receives from the U.S. the ammunition it needs in the war for its existence,\" Netanyahu posted on X today.\n\nThe U.S. has sharply pushed back against the Israeli leader's repeated claims that the U.S. is slow-walking weapons shipments to its close ally. At today's State Department press briefing, spokesperson MATTHEW MILLER minced no words, telling reporters: \"I'm not exactly sure what the prime minister is talking about or what he was trying to accomplish. All I can tell you is what the secretary told the prime minister directly in his meeting in Israel last week, which is that our commitment to Israel's security is sacrosanct.\"\n\n\"We have proved that, not just with words, but with deeds, and I don't think it's productive to engage in an intense public back and forth about this,\" Miller continued.\n\nA ROYAL SNUB: Spanish King FELIPE VI is refusing to grant an audience to Argentina's populist President JAVIER MILEI amid a major diplomatic rift between Madrid and Buenos Aires, our own SEB STARCEVIC reports. Earlier this year, the Spanish government recalled its ambassador to Argentina and publicly called on Milei to apologize after he assailed Spanish Prime Minister PEDRO S\u00c1NCHEZ and his wife at a rally in support of the far-right Vox party.\n\n-- ROBERT JOYCE is now senior policy adviser for the CHIPS program office in the Commerce Department.

In the Council meeting today, the participants will also present Bucharest's goals at the NATO Summit due in Washington next week, given that a deterrence posture is critical for Romania, and the country's defence capacity must be complete.\n\nOn the other hand, president Klaus Iohannis stated yesterday that after the discussion in the Council he would also make public his decision regarding his NATO leadership candidacy, after both Hungary and Slovakia had announced their support for Mark Rutte (Netherlands) as the next NATO secretary general.", "source": {"uri": "rador.ro", "dataType": "news", "title": "rador.ro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "g_r@rador.ro", "name": "G.

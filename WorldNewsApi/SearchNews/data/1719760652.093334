{"id": 225010834, "title": "Dortmund heads into Champions League final with an older, tougher team instead of young talents", "text": "DORTMUND, Germany (AP) \u2014 Borussia Dortmund is world soccer\u2019s finishing school no longer. A club renowned for readying talented youngsters like Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland for the big stage is now on that stage itself, facing Real Madrid \u2014 and Bellingham \u2014 in the Champions League final Saturday. This Dortmund team is different, though. It\u2019s built around older players making the most of second chances after career setbacks. \u201cWe have our own story,\u201d coach Edin Terzic said Tuesday. \u201cWe have the story of ups and downs of the last years. We are one of the teams that is selling players by the end of the season. We are a team that builds up to compete every year, but now we are there and we are facing teams that are built to win the Champions League.\u201d And then there\u2019s Jadon Sancho. The former England national team forward has revived his career since rejoining Dortmund on loan in January from Manchester United, where he hadn\u2019t played since August amid a rift with manager Erik ten Hag. The final at Wembley will be the last game of Sancho\u2019s loan, but Dortmund hopes it will also start fresh talks on keeping him. \u201cWe are so proud, we are so happy that he\u2019s in our team at the moment and I can see his smile every day, I can see his performance on the pitch every day,\u201d sporting director Sebastian Kehl said. \u201cSo I think he will be very important for us on Saturday. He will show the world that Jadon Sancho is really back.\u201d Kehl said Dortmund plans \u201cdiscussions\u201d about the 24-year-old Sancho\u2019s future, but only after Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cHe\u2019s still under contract with Man United, so nobody knows what\u2019s going on there,\u201d Kehl added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have discussions, but after the final.\u201d Sancho isn\u2019t the only Dortmund player who has been rejected elsewhere. Defender Mats Hummels and midfielder Emre Can were both left out of the German national team squad for their home European Championship, and Sancho wasn\u2019t picked for England. The Champions League gives them the chance to show they remain competitive at the top level \u2014 and maybe even earn a dramatic recall for Euro 2024. The 30-year-old Can suggested he and Sancho could be inspired by that rejection when they play against Madrid. \u201cHe\u2019s not happy about it, of course. Me also, I\u2019m not in the German squad, I\u2019m not happy about it,\u201d Can said. \u201cOf course, it gives you maybe the extra motivation to show the coaches in national teams that we deserve to be there. That\u2019s what we will try on Saturday.\u201d Only two Dortmund players made the Germany squad for Euro 2024, including striker Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, who spent much of his career in the second division before finally breaking through at 29 with Werder Bremen and making his national team debut in 2022. Forward S\u00e9bastien Haller is in the Champions League final less than two years on from a diagnosis of testicular cancer which left him needing chemotherapy and surgery before he returned to action with Dortmund. He\u2019s seeking his second trophy of the season after scoring the winning goal in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast in February. Dortmund does have some promising young players, but winger Jamie Bynoe-Gittens and striker Youssoufa Moukoko, both 19-year-olds, have typically been on the bench in the Champions League this season and 21-year-old American Gio Reyna was loaned out to Nottingham Forest. There isn\u2019t an obvious successor to Bellingham, who was sold for up to 130 million euros ($139 million at the time) to Madrid last year, or Haaland, who earlier moved to Manchester City for 60 million euros ($63 million at the time) and won the Champions League last year. Sporting director Kehl himself has unfinished business in the Champions League. Dortmund is in the final for the first time since 2013, when it lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich, also at Wembley. Kehl, then a midfielder, was on the bench in that game. Dortmund is coming off its worst Bundesliga season in nine years with a fifth-place finish, but has shown in the Champions League that its grizzled, battle-scarred squad can peak in crucial games. There\u2019s been a healthy dose of luck, too, after Dortmund survived Paris Saint-Germain repeatedly hitting the post and crossbar in the semifinals. A year after dropping the Bundesliga title in the final minutes of the season, Dortmund is aiming to end this campaign on a triumph. \u201cThere is one more game left and it\u2019s the biggest game in European club competition,\u201d Terzic said. \u201cThis is waiting for us, and we have to show that we are ready to go for it.\u201d ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2RvcnRtdW5kLWNoYW1waW9ucy1sZWFndWUtZmluYWwtamFkb24tc2FuY2hvLWI4MjJkYTRjMGQ2NzY5ODM4YTY4ZWM3NzhhNzQyZjcz0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Dortmund heads into Champions League final with an older, tougher team instead of young talents</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/dortmund-champions-league-final-jadon-sancho-b822da4c0d6769838a68ec778a742f73", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/278d6e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7934x4463+0+413/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fff%2Fe4%2Fa8fa36501e31263f846296508885%2F149e9671bc2f470f976221909687e46a", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:33:10", "author": "James Ellingworth", "authors": ["James Ellingworth"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.011}

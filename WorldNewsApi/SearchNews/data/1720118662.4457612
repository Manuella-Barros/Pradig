The children\u2019s book is a story that touches on why greeting each other with kisses on the cheek is a part of Haitian culture. The organization facilitates learning and literacy opportunities for children across the world.\u201c[This celebration] is about more than representation in books that children can read in their mother tongue and can physically see themselves in those pages,\u201d she said. \u201cThis celebration holds personal significance. It\u2019s personal because as an author, I have never felt as seen, heard, and empowered as I do now.\u201d", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-con", "url": "https://haitiantimes.com/2024/06/02/tico-armand-room-to-read/", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2152274695-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:00", "author": "The Haitian Times", "authors": ["The Haitian Times"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.756}

Chief Minister Revanth Reddy has ordered inquiry into the incident, said the Minister.\n\nThe retaining wall of the Sunkishala project of the Nagarjuna Sagar dam across Krishna river in Nalgonda collapsed had collapsed on August1. No casualties were reported. The collapse occurred during a shift change when the water breached the dead storage and spilt over to the Sunkishala pump house.\n\nThe Minister said the Sunkishala project was built during the BRS regime. The Municipal, HMDA and Metro Water Works officials should conduct a thorough investigation into the accident, he added.\n\nCriticising the BRS leaders remarks about Chief Minister Revanth Reddy's US visit, Ponnam said, \"When Chief Minister Revanth Reddy officially went to America for the interests of Telangana, the BRS leaders are trying to make fun of it by mentioning family issues.\"\n\nSpeaking to the media at Bhimadevarapalli on Thursday, he reminded that the previous Chief Minister never thought of brining investments to the state. He suggested that the leaders of BRS should rethink that they are making accusations to cover up the failures of the previous government.\n\nHe said that BRS has done damage to the people of Telangana by building Kaleswaram on the basis of ill-advised decisions not benefitted the farmers in Telangana. BRS MLAs ran away because they could not give proper answers in the Assembly. KCR is not coming to the Assembly as he is not willing to address the Speaker, a Dalit.\n\nThose who are able to avail 200 units of free electricity and Rs 500 of gas should submit details. Rs 2 lakh farmer loans are being waived at once and so far loan waivers up to Rs 1.50 lakh completed. Those who could not avail loan waiver should give the details to the agriculture officials, Prabhakar said.\n\nHe said that Rs 21 crore have been released for loan waiver in Bhimadevarapalli mandal. The BRS leaders are talking impatiently because they got zero seats in Lok Sabha polls. Minister Kishan Reddy, while criticising Congress is trying to repeat KCR's words that those who could avail the loan waiver should question Congress government, he said.\n\nHe said that BRS is not separate from BJP and people also see it that way.

The project was designed to lift water from Nagarjuna Sagar at the dead storage level (462 feet).\n\nHe claimed that Sunkishala works were completed expeditiously and only motor fitting works were remaining.\n\n\"We had fixed the target of completing the project by 2024 summer but this government kept the works pending,\" he said.\n\nHe advised the Congress government to stop blaming BRS for whatever bad happened and claiming credit for anything good.\n\nHe slammed the government for attacking BRS for the incident.

Rama Rao, party legislators and former minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Md. Mahamood Ali and P. Sabitha Indra Reddy and MLA K.P. Vivekanand said that the incident had taken place due to lack of proper supervision of the project works despite the caution of the Hyderabad Water Works engineers not to take up fixing up of gates during the flood season.\n\nInquiry by sitting or retired judge demanded\n\nThey demanded that the government order an inquiry into the incident, involving the public exchequer, with a sitting or retired judge and the announcement be made by Deputy Chief Minister M. Bhatti Vikramarka during his reported scheduled visit to the incident site. The BRS leaders said that there was no loss of life in the incident as it happened during the time when workers' change shifts.\n\nTerming the incident as a result of lack of responsibility & failure of the Chief Minister and the government, Mr. Rao said it had taken place when the Assembly was in session, on August 2 morning, but the government hid it from people and the Assembly though it was a practice to make announcements on any major incidents in the House. The Chief Minister left for the U.S. tour 24 hours after the incident.\n\nIn case, there was no fault of the government in the incident, why it was kept a secret for a week till it came out through social media and now trying to blame the previous (BRS) government, he questioned the government. Mr. Rao demanded that the government keep the agency executing the work in blacklist till the inquiry was over, if the government was sincere about the incident.\n\nAsking the government not to order a departmental inquiry and institute a judicial probe, he mentioned that both the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had demanded probe by a national agency when the Medigadda incident had taken place and the National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) was swift in giving its report.\n\nMr. Rama Rao alleged that it had become a practice for the Congress Government in its nine-month journey to claim everything that results in good as its success and anything that turns bad as failure of the previous government. He cited the example of how the present government claimed credit for giving appointment letters to 30,000 jobs, though the recruitment process was completed during the BRS regime.\n\nHe stated that Sunkishala drinking water project was not a new idea but was initially planned by Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy Government, but was shelved after farmers' protests in which a Sub-Inspector of Police was also reportedly killed.

Rajasekhara Reddy Governments too had considered it but did not take it forward due to farmers' protests.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabitha_Indra_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabitha Indra Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talasani_Srinivas_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talasani Srinivas Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanth_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revanth Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranga_Reddy_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranga Reddy district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ranga Reddy district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalgonda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nalgonda"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nalgonda"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotla_Vijaya_Bhaskara_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y._S._Rajasekhara_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Y.

What We Know On Speculations In Telangana Political Landscape", "body": "If the merger or alliance happens, speculations are rife that K.T. Rama Rao (KTR) or T. Harish Rao could be positioned as the leader of the opposition in the Telangana state assembly.Source : X\n\nTelangana politics is abuzz with unconfirmed reports suggesting that Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are in talks about a possible merger. Although no official announcements have been made, the possibility of such a political move could have significant ramifications for both state and national politics, especially in Telangana, where the BRS has been a dominant force.\n\nRumors have been circulating about a recent high-profile meeting between a senior BRS leader and a key figure from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent organization of the BJP.\n\nThe RSS functionary, known for his influence in BJP circles, is believed to have assured the BRS leadership that their political futures would be safeguarded under a new coalition or merger.\n\nSources suggest that BRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) might be offered a Rajya Sabha seat along with a Union Cabinet position. Meanwhile, his son K.T. Rama Rao (KTR) or nephew T. Harish Rao could be positioned as the leader of the opposition in the Telangana state assembly if the merger proceeds.\n\nDespite the potential benefits, the proposed alliance is reportedly facing stiff resistance from within the BJP.\n\nState-level BJP leaders are wary of aligning with the BRS, citing concerns over ideological differences and the possible dilution of the BJP's regional identity. Several senior BJP MPs have voiced their opposition fearing that such a merger could weaken the party's distinct presence in Telangana.\n\nSimilarly, within the BRS, there is cautious skepticism. Some BRS leaders are concerned that merging with the BJP could erode the party's regional identity and alienate its core voter base. They argue that the BJP could benefit disproportionately from the BRS's established presence in Telangana, leaving the future of BRS leaders uncertain.\n\nIn response to the growing rumors, KT Rama Rao, the working president of BRS and KCR's son, took to social media to dismiss the speculation. In a strongly worded message, he emphasised the party's commitment to Telangana and warned those spreading \"baseless rumors\" of legal action.\n\nTaking to X, KTR said: \"To those spreading baseless rumors with hidden agendas, let this be your final warning. Publish a rejoinder to your malicious lies against the BRS, or face legal action BRS will continue to serve the people of Telangana as it has been for over two decades. Stop spreading baseless rumours We fall, we rise, and we fight solely for Telangana! We will never bow down. Not now, not ever! Jai Telangana! If the merger or alliance does come to fruition, it could dramatically alter the political landscape in Telangana and even affect neighbouring states. The combined political machinery of the BRS and BJP could pose a formidable challenge to rival parties.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Harish_Rao", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T.

The Emmy Award-winning actor, who portrays Rue's (Zendaya) sponsor, recently opened up about this surprising twist in his career during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nDomingo shared his astonishment at the newfound attention, saying, \"It's really kind of incredible.\" He recounted how fans often see him as a mentor or father figure, saying, \"They look at me and they want me to be their big brother, their father figure, their counselor or something.\"\n\nIn a humorous anecdote, Domingo recalled a moment driving on Los Angeles' 405 freeway when a group of young fans started to recognize him. His husband noticed the girls' lingering glances and asked if something was wrong. Domingo, initially unsure of what was happening, waved to the girls, only to be met with excited screams. \"So I'm a 54-year-old heartthrob as well,\" he chuckled.\n\nDespite his surprising popularity, Domingo has embraced this new chapter with grace. Reflecting on his journey, he joked, \"I never knew it would happen, but it's happened at the ripe old age of 54. As long as it happened at some point in my life, right?\"\n\nLooking ahead, Domingo will reprise his role as Ali in the third season of 'Euphoria,' which is slated to begin filming in January 2025. He remains optimistic about the show, even in the face of recent controversies and challenges.\n\nAddressing concerns from a 2022 report alleging a \"toxic production\" environment on the set of 'Euphoria,' Domingo defended the show's demanding nature. \"I'm not gonna invalidate anyone's experience,\" he said. \"But working in television involves long hours -- sometimes up to 14 hours a day. It requires a methodical work ethic, which some young actors may not be ready for.\"\n\nDrawing from his 32 years in the industry, Colman Domingo remarked, \"I know what hard work is. When I heard those reports, I thought, 'Where is this coming from? That's just a normal workday.' Be a professional.\"\n\nWith his blend of humor and humility, Domingo continues to navigate his evolving career, delighting fans and colleagues alike.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colman_Domingo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colman Domingo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Colman-Domingo-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801628", "eventUri": "eng-9801628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

The actor reveals he's become a heartthrob in his 50s, all thanks to his role on Euphoria.\n\nThe Sing Sing star plays Rue's (Zendaya)sponsor Ali on the HBO drama, and creator Sam Levinson wrote the part for him \"based on someone who was [his] sponsor,\" Domingo previously told Entertainment Weekly. But he had no idea the role would go on to turn him into a TV crush for a new generation.\n\n\"It's really kind of incredible,\" Domingo said on SiriusXM's The Spotlight with Jessica Shaw about a younger audience knowing him from the show. \"They're like, 'Oh my god, Ali!' And usually what's so sweet, they look at me and they want me to be their big brother, their father figure, their counselor or something.\"\n\nBut he's also had some wilder encounters with younger fans. \"I was literally driving down the 405 in L.A. and a group of young girls kept looking at me and my husband was like, 'Those girls are looking at you.

And I think it just happened in a very organic way for Sam... I felt incredibly blessed for this episode.\"\n\nDomingo will also appear in the forthcoming Michael Jackson biopic Michael as the singer's father and a Nat King Cole biopic that he'll direct himself.\n\nLevinson previously told Elle that he sees the third season as a \"film noir.\" Through Rue he plans to \"explore what it means to be an individual with principles in a corrupt world,\" he said.\n\nEuphoria costume designer Heidi Bivens hinted to Vogue that the third season would take place years after the second. \"I'm really excited to read the scripts,\" she said. \"There is talk of it being approximately five years in the future, and that they're not in high school anymore.\"\n\n\"I hope it's soon, or they're going to have to Benjamin Button me or something,\" he said. \"I'm going to have a bad back walking down the hallway, you know?\" He also thought a time jump would make sense: \"I'm assuming that we'll have to go forward.

I was insecure about being tall, my nose, my body -- I was very skinny. At some point you make agreements and you're like, Well, this is mine. I guess if I don't love it, nobody else will.\n\n\"And so I started to take steps to love it and understand what I'm working with.

In a recent interview with Blavity Shadow and Act Managing Editor Trey Mangum, Domingo shared insights about the film's innovative model that empowers everyone involved, from stars to personal assistants, to have financial and creative equity.\n\nDomingo explained that when he joined the project, there was no script. The creative team, including director Clint Bentley and producer Monique Walton, aimed to explore a different approach to film financing. Instead of relying on traditional studios or streaming services, they sought independent financing to keep overhead costs low and foster a community-driven environment.\n\nIn this unique model, every participant in the film has a stake, blurring the lines between roles. Domingo emphasized the collaborative spirit and the sense of ownership allowed everyone to feel personally invested in the project.\n\nDomingo highlighted the importance of community in the filmmaking process. He noted that on set, everyone felt like it was their film, fostering a sense of responsibility and care. This approach contrasts sharply with the traditional model, where many feel like mere hired hands. Domingo believes that this community-based model not only enhances creativity but also strengthens the bond among the cast and crew.\n\nTo gain deeper insights into Domingo's vision and the making of Sing Sing, watch the full interview with him and co-star Clarence \"Divine Eye\" Maclin.

It may go against public opinion sometimes, but I think that's my responsibility to find the complex version of these people.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Jackson_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Jackson (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jermaine Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/JdoAWR2IjlJEiowTRXWuYatHotE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x287:747x289)/colman-domingo-michael-jackson-070224-ad501a7a011c4e39a3e20f5d94908a54.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801628", "eventUri": "eng-9801628", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

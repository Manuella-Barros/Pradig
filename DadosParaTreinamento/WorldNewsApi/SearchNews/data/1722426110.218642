Amritpal Singh, a pro-Khalistan radical, is the chief of Waris Punjab De. He won the recent Lok Sabha election from Khadoor Sahib seat as an Independent. At present, he is lodged in Dibrugarh jail (Assam) under National Security Act (NSA). Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa too won the parliamentary poll from Faridkot seat as an Independent. He is the son of Beant Singh, one of the assassins of former PM Indira Gandhi. The Panthic organisations also stated that they are yet to take a call on fielding or supporting candidates for the upcoming four more bypolls. These decisions were announced after representatives of a few Panthic organisations met in Bathinda on Friday afternoon. Gurdeep Singh Bathinda, president, Sher-e-Punjab Akali Dal, said, \u201cFirst of all we thank the masses for giving so much support to Amritpal Singh and Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa. Though it was their own decision to contest elections, public supported them wholeheartedly. Many Panthic organisations had also extended support to them including us. However, regarding Jalandhar West bypoll, we prefer to stay away from it. We are neither supporting nor opposing anyone from this seat. We are grateful to the electorate for choosing Amritpal Singh and Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa over the SAD, BJP or other candidates.\u201d He added, \u201cNow, a false narrative is being spread about Sarabjeet Singh Khalsa and Amritpal Singh. We strongly condemn such forces. Communal harmony will continue to prevail in the state.\u201d Bathinda said that a fear psychosis is being created by some political forces after the victory of the two Panthic candidates in the Lok Sabha polls. Regarding the upcoming bypolls to Barnala, Gidderbaha, Chabbewal, and Dera Baba Nanak seats, the Panthic organisations are yet to take a call on either supporting a candidate or fielding one, he said. The family of one Bhagwant Singh, alias Pradhan Mantri Bajeke who is a member of Waris Punjab De, had recently stated that Bajeke wishes to contest bypoll from Gidderbaha. Bajeke, a close associate of Amritpal Singh, is also lodged in Dibrugarh jail under NSA. Regarding Bajeke, Bathinda said, \u201cAnyone can contest polls, but we are yet to take a call on extending support to him.\u201d Members of several Nihang Sikh organisations, SAD (Amritsar), Damdami Taksal, one Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member, an industrial organisation from Ludhiana and others participated in the meeting on Friday.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/panthic-jalandhar-west-bypoll-9421985/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/jalandhar-bypoll.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:24:28", "author": "Raakhi Jagga", "authors": ["Raakhi Jagga"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.072}

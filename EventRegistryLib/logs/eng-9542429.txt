This can be seen as a relief for risk proxies,\" Christopher Wong, FX strategist at OCBC Global Markets, said in a note.\n\nU.S. stock indexes appear to have stabilized after a rocky April following some hotter inflation data, as a much better-than-expected first-quarter earnings season and hopes of U.S. monetary policy easing draw buyers back into the market.\n\nThe Fed last week left interest rates unchanged and signaled it was leaning toward eventual reductions in borrowing costs, but repeated that it wants to gain \"greater confidence\" that inflation will continue to fall before cutting rates.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and his New York counterpart John Williams are scheduled to speak later in the day, kicking off speeches from a host of U.S. central bank officials this week.\n\nKey data releases this week will include weekly jobless claims and U.S. consumer sentiment data for May.\n\nWith the earnings season in full swing, markets will watch out for quarterly numbers from major firms including Walt Disney, Uber and Arm Holdings later this week.\n\nOf the 397 firms in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings as of Friday, 76.8% have reported earnings above analyst estimates, compared with the long-term average of 66.7%, as per LSEG data.\n\nAt 07:19 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 123 points, or 0.32%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 17.25 points, or 0.33% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 41.25 points, or 0.23%.\n\nApple dipped 0.5% after the value of Berkshire's stake in the iPhone maker fell 22% to $135.4 billion as of March 31, from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nParamount Global added 3% after the media company ended its exclusive negotiations with Skydance Media without a deal, allowing the special committee to entertain other offers from rival bidders.\n\nPerficient jumped 52.3% after Swedish private equity firm EQT AB said it would take the U.S.-based digital consultancy firm private in an all-cash deal valued at about $3 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shristi Achar A in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Shinjini Ganguli)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

rate cuts", "body": "NEW YORK, May 6 -- Wall Street's main stock indexes gained today as expectations of interest rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve grew stronger following a soft payrolls data last week.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow closed at three-week highs on Friday after data showed US job growth slowed more than expected in April, taking pressure off the US central bank to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nTraders are currently pricing in rate cuts worth 48 basis points from the Fed by the end of 2024, with the first cut expected in September or November, according to LSEG's rate probability app. In recent weeks, traders had priced in just one cut due to signs of sticky inflation.\n\n\"It's been this tug of war between what you're seeing play out in the rates market and the repricing of inflation and Fed policy versus what you're seeing on the earnings front,\" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.\n\n\"In our opinion, it's been a pretty even battle so far.\"\n\nUS stock indexes appear to have stabilised after a rocky April, as a much better-than-expected first-quarter earnings season and hopes of US monetary policy easing draw buyers back into the market.\n\nThe Fed left interest rates unchanged last week and signalled it was leaning toward eventual reductions in borrowing costs, but repeated that it wants to gain \"greater confidence\" that inflation will continue to fall before cutting rates.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and his New York counterpart John Williams are scheduled to speak later in the day, kicking off speeches from a host of US central bank policymakers this week.\n\nKey data releases this week include weekly jobless claims and US consumer sentiment data for May.\n\nWith the earnings season in full swing, investors will also keep an eye on quarterly numbers from major firms including Walt Disney, Uber and Arm Holdings this week.\n\nOf the 397 firms in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings through Friday, 76.8 per cent beat analysts' profit estimates, compared with the long-term average of 66.7 per cent, as per LSEG data.\n\nAt 09.41am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 146.36 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 38,822.38, the S&P 500 gained 26.70 points, or 0.52 per cent, to 5,154.49 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 85.00 points, or 0.53 per cent, to 16,241.33.\n\nNine of 11 S&P 500 sectors traded in the green, with energy leading gains, up 1.2 per cent, on higher crude prices.\n\nParamount Global added 4.2 per cent after the media company ended its exclusive negotiations with Skydance Media without a deal, allowing the special committee to entertain other offers from rival bidders.\n\nPerficient jumped 52.8 per cent after Swedish private equity firm EQT AB said it would take the US-based digital consultancy firm private in an all-cash deal valued at about US$3 billion (RM14.2 billion).\n\nSpirit Airlines shed 8.7 per cent after the US carrier forecast second-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, driven by sluggish improvement in domestic demand and grounding of dozens of its aircraft.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.82-to-1 ratio on Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq

Coupled with earnings season in corporate America surprising to the upside, this gave equity investors renewed positive moment in recent sessions.\n\nAfter the Fed last week signaled it was leaning towards eventual reductions in borrowing costs, but wanted to gain \"greater confidence\" that inflation will continue to fall before cutting rates, policymakers reiterated that message on Monday.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the current interest rate level should cool the economy enough to return inflation to the central bank's 2% target, with the strength of the job market giving officials time to wait.\n\nBarkin, a voter this year on interest rate policy, added that inflation \"data whiplash\" supported the Fed's deliberative policy towards interest rates.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said while rate cuts would happen, monetary policy was currently in a very good place.\n\n\"The primary thing that the market is trying to reason its way through is inflation and the Federal Reserve,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy &amp; research at Glenmede.\n\n\"A lot of the market's movements have been a reflection of the market really trying to figure out and fine tune the different perspectives on inflation and rates.\"\n\nTraders are currently pricing in rate cuts worth 46 basis points from the Fed by the end of 2024, with the first cut expected in September or November, according to LSEG's rate probability app.\n\nAccording to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 gained 52.91 points, or 1.03%, to end at 5,180.70 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 191.55 points, or 1.19%, to 16,347.88. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 175.34 points, or 0.45%, to 38,851.02.\n\nThe majority of S&amp;P 500 sectors ended in positive territory. The energy index was among the leading gainers, rising in part due to U.S. natural gas futures hitting their highest level in 14 weeks.\n\nWith the earnings season in full swing, investors will also keep an eye on quarterly numbers from major firms, including Walt Disney and Uber this week.\n\nOf the 397 firms in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings through Friday, 76.8% beat analysts' profit estimates, compared with the long-term average of 66.7%, as per LSEG data.\n\nArm Holdings is another with earnings on deck this week. It was up on Monday, as chipmakers broadly gained.\n\nMicron Technology increased after a report said Baird upgraded the stock, and Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer were higher - recovering ground lost after disappointing earnings from the pair last week.\n\nParamount Global advanced after the media company ended its exclusive negotiations with Skydance Media without a deal,

Coupled with earnings season in corporate America surprising to the upside, this has given investors renewed positive moment in recent sessions.\n\nAfter the Fed last week signaled it was leaning towards eventual reductions in borrowing costs, but wanted to gain \"greater confidence\" that inflation will continue to fall before cutting rates, policymakers reiterated that message today.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the current interest rate level should cool the economy enough to return inflation to the central bank's 2% target, with the strength of the job market giving officials time to wait.\n\nBarkin, a voter this year on interest rate policy, added that inflation \"data whiplash\" supported the Fed's deliberative policy towards interest rates.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said while rate cuts would happen, monetary policy was currently in a very good place.\n\n\"The primary thing that the market is trying to reason its way through is inflation and the Federal Reserve,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy & research at Glenmede.\n\n\"A lot of the market's movements have been a reflection of the market really trying to figure out and fine tune the different perspectives on inflation and rates.\"\n\nTraders are currently pricing in rate cuts worth 46 basis points from the Fed by the end of 2024, with the first cut expected in September or November, according to LSEG's rate probability app.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 176.59 points, or 0.46%, to 38,852.27, the S&P 500 gained 52.95 points, or 1.03%, to 5,180.74 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 192.92 points, or 1.19%, to 16,349.25.\n\nThe majority of S&P 500 sectors ended in positive territory. The energy index was among the leading gainers, rising in part due to U.S. natural gas futures hitting their highest level in 14 weeks.\n\nChipmakers broadly gained today, including Arm Holdings, which rose 5.2% ahead of earnings later this week.\n\nMicron Technology increased 4.7% after a report said Baird upgraded the stock, and Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer gained 3.4% and 6.1%, respectively - recovering ground lost after disappointing earnings from the pair last week.\n\nParamount Global advanced 3.1% after the media company ended its exclusive negotiations with Skydance Media without a deal, allowing the special committee to entertain other offers from rival bidders.\n\nTyson Foods fell 5.7% after the meatpacker surpassed Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit but warned that consumers were under pressure from persistent inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, Spirit Airlines slumped 9.7%, to a record closing low, after reporting a weak revenue outlook for the second quarter.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 150 new highs and 54 new lows.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType":

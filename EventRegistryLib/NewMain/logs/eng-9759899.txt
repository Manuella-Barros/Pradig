in the Paris Olympics got under way amid a ring of steel and a chorus of boos at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night.\n\nOver 1,000 French police, including masked counter-terrorist officers, created an additional security barrier prior to the nation's clash with Mali in their first game in the men's football competition.\n\nIsrael's national anthem was booed by some sections in the approximately half-full stadium prior to kick-off, but otherwise there were no immediate signs of orchestrated protests promised by pro-Palestinian campaigners over the war in Gaza.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who greeted police outside the stadium prior to kick-off and attended the match, said the additional deployment was necessary in order \"to ensure that we are there for the sport.\"\n\nFans of both nations mixed freely and largely peacefully inside and outside the stadium, although tempers frayed in a section immediately beneath the media tribune, where a small number of spectators waved Palestinian flags, causing security officials to intervene.\n\nBecause Palestine has a team of eight athletes competing at the Games, Palestinian flags are permitted inside all Paris Olympic venues.\n\nMore than 20 police vans and a cavalcade of motor bikes surrounded the Israeli team bus as it swept from the team's compound in the northern suburbs to the famous old stadium.\n\nMali, whose population is 95 per cent Muslim, has not had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1973, but officials representing the African nation distanced themselves from any prospective protests in the build-up to the match.\n\nThe massive security operation was deemed necessary to protect the Israeli delegation, some of whom have reported receiving death threats ahead of

campaign", "body": "Paris (AFP) - Around 1,000 French police officers were on duty Wednesday to provide security at Israel's football match against Mali at the Paris Olympics, a high-risk occasion which saw fans flying Palestinian and Israel flags.\n\nDuring the Israeli national anthem, whistles were also heard around the cavernous Parc des Princes where around 25,000 fans were watching the game.\n\nAt the same time, some spectators displayed shirts with \"Free Palestine\" written across their fronts.\n\nPalestinian flags were waved by a handful of spectators which led to angry exchanges between them and Israeli fans.\n\nWhen pro-Palestinian spectators sported yellow stickers plastered with the words \"Gaza: Silence kills\", they were told by stewards to remove them.\n\nThe game involving the Israeli team as well as the Ukraine-Iraq match in the southeastern city of Lyon, had been identified by French security forces as high risk.\n\n\"All the competitions have a security plan, but it's true that these two matches, and particularly the match at the Parc des Princes, will have security, an anti-terror perimeter,\" French interior minister Gerald Darmanin told BFM television and RMC radio before kick-off.\n\n\"Tonight at the Parc des Princes there will be a thousand police officers who will ensure that we are there for the sport,\" he added.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog was attending the match.\n\nAll Israeli athletes at the Paris Games, which start officially on Friday, will have round-the-clock personal security provided by elite French police, both inside the Olympic village and every time they leave the compound in northern Paris.\n\nA French police source told AFP that security forces had been \"expecting actions and disturbances around the stadium\" on Wednesday and said it was possible that \"people shout insults from the stands\" or that there is \"whistling and flags shown during the hymns, for example\".\n\nThe game kicked off at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT).\n\nEuropalestine, a French activist group behind recent protests, told the Guardian newspaper that it was planning a peaceful demonstration inside the stadium to protest the \"genocide\" in Gaza.\n\n\"We do not take (the threat) lightly, we are on high alert and all athletes have been informed of the situation,\" said Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer.\n\n\"Our duty to protect our athletes, in cooperation with the French authorities, is of the utmost importance,\" he added.\n\nDarmanin later Wednesday described the match as \"particularly sensitive\" but added \"there is no security problem to our knowledge\".\n\n\"The Israeli team will be protected by the Republic.\"\n\nThe head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday rejected a Palestinian demand that Israel be barred from the Paris Games over the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestine Olympic Committee asked for a ban on Israel in a letter to the IOC, saying the bombings of the besieged Gaza Strip were a breach of the Olympic truce.\n\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Wednesday at least 39,145 people have been killed in more than nine months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants.\n\nThe Israeli offensive on Gaza came after Hamas militants launched a shock attack on October 7 that resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Officers acted quickly after the potential bomb alert was called in, promptly closing off the entire street and surrounding area.\n\nTraffic subsequently halted to a standstill, causing interruptions to the Olympic bus service.

But ticketing issues and long queue lines outside Parc des Princes resulted in loads of empty seats inside the stadium upon kick-off.\n\nWidespread protests are expected at this year's Olympics amid the intensified geopolitical tensions regarding the ongoing war in Gaza.

They cordoned off the streets around the Parc des Princes in western Paris and set up a perimeter a few kilometres away from the stadium\n\nThe Paris 2024 Summer Games take place amid pronounced security concerns and heightened geopolitical tensions, including over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli competitors are being escorted by elite tactical units to and from events and given 24-hour protection throughout the Olympics, officials say.\n\nBut the Group D match, which ended in a 1-1 draw, and was attended by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Israeli President Isaac Herzog, was spared of any major incidents as both sets of supporters sought to put to one side the politics.\n\nMalian and Israeli flags were abundant and the pre-match good-natured with supporters mingling. Inside the stadium Malian supporters appeared to outnumber and out sing their Israeli rivals.\n\nThe Israeli national anthem was initially booed before those cries were drowned out. A few supporters waved Palestinian flags.\n\nA handful of people at the start of the game stood near the pitch wearing white t-shirts each with a letter to read out \"Free Palestine.\" After a minute stewards intervened.\n\n\"I don't really care about the minority who don't want Israel here,\" said Michael Levy, 50, whose nephew Ethan plays in the Israeli team. He added that he was at the stadium to have fun and enjoy the football.\n\n\"Anti-semitism is a disease and I'm not here to be the cure.\"\n\nOther Israeli fans also said they wanted an Olympic truce to forget the war in Gaza and enjoy the festivities.\n\nMali, a mainly Muslim state, broke off ties with Israel in 1973 after the Yom Kippur war.\n\nAs a former French colony, there is a large Malian diaspora in France and they came out in force to back their players.\n\nDressed in a traditional dress in the yellow, green and red colours of Mali, Aisha Cisse, who had travelled from Bamako and follows the country's soccer teams at all international tournaments, danced and sang her support saying she was simply here to watch The Eagles, the team's nickname, win.\n\nThe heavy security presence appeared to dampen any hope of protests against Israel's participation in the Games as some, including\n\nFrench far-left lawmakers had urged.\n\n\"We are here for the football and we shouldn't mix politics with football,\" said Franco-Malian Kouma, 31, who works in the restaurant business.\n\n'GREAT ATMOSPHERE'\n\nThe Israel-Mali match offered a first snapshot of how other competitors and the wider public respond to Israeli participation in the games.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Games take place five decades after Palestinian militants killed 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.\n\nAt their training headquarters in Croissy, some 20 kilometres west of Paris, the Israeli players on Tuesday sought to come across as relaxed, but there was some tension in the air.\n\nMedia minders yelled \"only football\" when reporters attempted to ask questions about the political backdrop.\n\n\"We came here to win and achieve things with this team and are very excited,\" Omri Gandelman, a midfielder who plays for Belgian side Gent, told reporters. \"We have a job to do.\" (Reporting by John Irish;

Inside the stadium Malian supporters appeared to outnumber and out sing their Israeli rivals.\n\nThe Israeli national anthem was initially booed before those cries were drowned out.

The Israelis traveled in a cocoon of safety in the center of the huge motorcade, packed into a city bus pressed into special duty for the Games. Then came more vans, more police outriders, more sirens -- a stunning show of force with one task: to protect the first Israeli participants to take the field of play in the Paris Games.\n\nThe security of Israel's team at the Olympics -- any Olympics -- has been a critical issue since the killing of 11 athletes and coaches at the Munich Games in 1972. The ongoing war in Gaza and the global protests that have accompanied it have made the Paris Games perhaps the most fraught sporting event featuring Israeli athletes in the half-century since then.\n\nFor Paris 2024 organizers, then, the mere presence of Israel's delegation has presented the biggest security concern after the sprawling opening ceremony that is set to take place on the River Seine on Friday. It also made the Israelis' soccer game against Mali on Wednesday an early test for almost every element of France's security apparatus.\n\nIsrael has projected calm about its nerves and its security before the opener -- \"No one is worried,\" its coach, Guy Luzon, said on Tuesday -- but signs that Wednesday evening would be a charged affair were clear from before the first ball was kicked. Israeli's anthem was met by jeers from sections of the half-filled stadium, and some spectators wearing white T-shirts with letters that spelled the words \"Free Palestine\" were swiftly removed by security.\n\nG\u00e9rald Darmanin, France's interior minister, attended the game, days after he had promised to provide Israel with what he described as \"24/7 security.\"\n\nOn Friday, that show of force meant counterterrorism officers dressed in tactical gear, several battalions of local and national police officers and members of the bomb squad were firmly in place several hours before Israel's team made its way to the stadium.\n\nIsrael has sent almost 90 athletes to Paris, and Israeli officials and the French government have laid an unusually heavy security blanket over them.\n\nThat much was already clear a day before Wednesday's game, when the team held a training session on an otherwise sleepy morning at a community sports center on the outer edge of Paris. The scene offered an up-close view into just how tight Israel's security will be throughout its stay in Paris.\n\nPolice officers with automatic weapons patrolled the perimeter of the center even before Israel's team arrived for training. Inside, more armed agents, some in plainclothes and others from the French Interior Ministry's close protection unit, took their places on a running track that ringed the field during a training session.\n\nWhen a group of players broke away to speak with a small gathering of journalists, some of the security agents took up positions nearby. Before the first question, a team media officer insisted that the war in Gaza and Israeli politics were off limits.\n\nThe players and their coach stuck to the script, talking about their excitement about being in the athletes' village and their hopes of not only competing, but also succeeding.\n\n\"We are very excited, but we have a job to do,\" midfielder Omri Gandelman said.\n\nMr. Darmanin acknowledged this week that the Israeli delegation would be granted more protection than any other participants at the Games, and confirmed that Israel had sought -- and been granted -- dispensation to deploy its own armed agents on French soil to protect its teams and officials.\n\nIsraeli officials made other requests, too. A demand that its chefs be present at all venues where its teams and athletes are present was accepted, as was a request for a soccer training site outside central Paris. But another, that the news media be barred from practices, was not.\n\nPhysical security, though, was just part of Israel's preparations. To prepare its soccer team for a potentially hostile reception, Israel also hired a psychologist to work with the players on what they might see and hear.\n\nOn Wednesday, members of that team took its first steps onto the Olympic stage, and fans who had traveled to see them said they felt reassured after arriving at the stadium.\n\nGal Vaknin, 35, said he had arrived on the day of the game from the coastal city of Ashkelon, Israel, and was warned by relatives not to dress in his country's blue and white colors by French relatives. He did as he was told, until he reached the outskirts of the stadium.\n\n\"I'm very excited to be here, especially being Israeli in this time and just to show the world we are normal, we are human,\" he said.\n\nThe game struggled to hold the attention of some fans as scuffles and arguments broke out repeatedly between fans supporting Israel and attendees brandishing the Palestinian flag.\n\nThe Palestinian flag is not banned in stadiums -- a Palestinian team is at the Games, too -- but some slogans are. But the focus on Gaza meant that at times it felt as if fans of three nations were present at the stadium, with Mali's contingent relegated to third-wheel status.\n\nThe game itself became little more than a sideshow. It finished 1-1.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tariq_panja@nytimes.com", "name": "Tariq Panja", "type": "author",

including masked counter-terrorist officers, created an additional security barrier prior to the nation's clash with Mali in their first game in the men's football competition.\n\nIsrael's national anthem was booed by some sections in the approximately half-full stadium prior to kick-off, but otherwise there were no immediate signs of orchestrated protests promised by pro-Palestinian campaigners over the war in Gaza.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who greeted police outside the stadium prior to kick-off and attended the match, said the additional deployment was necessary in order \"to ensure that we are there for the sport.\"\n\nFans of both nations mixed freely and largely peacefully inside and outside the stadium, although tempers frayed in a section immediately beneath the media tribune, where a small number of spectators waved Palestinian flags, causing security officials to intervene.\n\nBecause Palestine has a team of eight athletes competing at the Games, Palestinian flags are permitted inside all Paris Olympic venues.\n\nMore than 20 police vans and a cavalcade of motor bikes surrounded the Israeli team bus as it swept from the team's compound in the northern suburbs to the famous old stadium.\n\nMali, whose population is 95 per cent Muslim, has not had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1973, but officials representing the African nation distanced themselves from any prospective protests in the build-up to the match.\n\nThe massive security operation was deemed necessary to protect the Israeli delegation, some of whom have reported receiving death threats ahead of the Games.\n\nLast week, the Palestinian Football Association submitted a motion to suspend Israel from international competition, which world governing body FIFA said it will consider following the end of the Games.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fans from both sides endeavored to minimize the political context and enjoy the action. France deployed around 1,000 police officers backed by Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, to manage security for the evening kick-off. Streets around the Parc des Princes in western Paris were cordoned off, with a perimeter established a few kilometers from the stadium.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Summer Games occur amid heightened security concerns and geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israeli athletes receive 24-hour protection, escorted by elite tactical units to and from events. The Group D match, which ended in a 1-1 draw and was attended by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and Israeli President Isaac Herzog, saw no major incidents as supporters focused on the game. Both Malian and Israeli flags were on display, and fans mingled before the match. Despite a few small protests, such as supporters with 'Free Palestine' shirts, the atmosphere remained largely peaceful.\n\nMichael Levy, whose nephew Ethan plays on the Israeli team, expressed his desire to enjoy the game and disregard political tensions. Other Israeli fans called for an Olympic truce to set aside the conflict and celebrate the event. Mali's large diaspora in France strongly supported their team, led by enthusiastic fan Aisha Cisse. The heavy security presence seemed to dampen any serious protests against Israel's participation, despite calls from some French far-left lawmakers. Franco-Malian Kouma emphasized the game's sporting spirit over political discord. The match provided a glimpse into the reception of Israeli participation in the Paris 2024 Games, taking place fifty years after the tragic Munich Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Herzog", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Herzog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_the_Interior_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of the Interior (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munich massacre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/24_07_2024_15_33_54_0147412.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759899", "eventUri": "eng-9759899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

protests", "body": "Some fans had political slogans removed from their clothing and there were minor clashes between supporters of Palestinian and Israel\n\nPARC DES PRINCES -- Tempers ran high in the stands but Paris 2024 appeared to pass its first major security test as the Israeli team made their first appearance of the Olympic Games.\n\nThe Israel anthem was loudly booed at the Parc des Princes ahead of their clash with Mali, a majority Muslim country, while dozens of Palestinian flags were seen dotted around the stadium.\n\nOne section of supporters, seemingly sitting in the Olympic Family section which can include representatives from any international federation, had stickers bearing pro-Gaza slogans removed but held Palestinian flags up throughout. \"Political propaganda\" is banned in Olympic venues but as Palestine are a nation at the games, bearing their flag is perfectly legitimate.\n\nAnd the same group of Palestinian supporters had to be kept apart from angry Israel supporters on more than one occasion, but they represented a small minority of a crowd otherwise immersed in the game, which ended 1-1.\n\nOutside the ground, thirteen fans had shirts that spelt \"Free Palestine\", while 1,000 French police officers were drafted in to form an \"anti-terror perimeter\".\n\nAnd alone among nations at these Games, Israel will have round-the-clock protection from a specialist elite unit of French police, as well as their own added security.\n\nFrance's interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, said the Israel vs Mali had been identified as being high risk along with the tie between Ukraine and Iraq, which was staged earlier in the south-eastern city of Lyon.\n\nIsraeli president Isaac Herzog was in Paris earlier on Wednesday, meeting athletes along with Ilana Romano and Ankie Spitzer, the widows of Yossef Romano and Andrei Spitzer, two athletes murdered at the 1972 Munich Games.\n\nBut tensions ahead of this match has been stoked by a hard-left French politician, who told a pro-Palestinian gathering that Israeli athletes should not be welcomed at the Games.\n\nAnd on Monday, Palestinian Olympic Committee said it had written to International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach asking him to ban Israel from the Olympics.\n\nThe letter claimed that \"approximately 400 Palestinian athletes have been killed, and the destruction of sports facilities exacerbates the plight of athletes who are already under severe restrictions\".\n\nEarlier this week, Back reinforced his belief in the Olympic truce, insisting \"we can manage to bring the entire world together in peace\".\n\nChaotic ending to Morocco vs Argentina\n\nElsewhere, on a day of chaos, crowd trouble forced Morocco and Argentina to be delayed by nearly two hours and the game to be completed behind closed doors.\n\nMorocco had been 2-1 ahead against Argentina in Saint Etienne but Cristian Medina appeared to have equalised in the 16th minute of what was supposed to be 15 minutes of added time.\n\nPlayers were quickly led to safety as cups and bottles were thrown at the celebrating players, while some Morocco fans stormed the pitch.\n\nRiot police were called in to guard the pitch after stewards had removed the invaders, while the referee led the players down the tunnel.\n\nFans were soon told to leave the stadium but, after a delay of 100 minutes, it was revealed the final three minutes of the match would be played in an empty stadium.\n\nIncredibly, it was then announced Argentina's equaliser had been ruled out by VAR for offside in the build-up.\n\nJust under two hours after the match was stopped, it resumed and Morocco held on to win 2-1.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Varun has been in the industry for around three decades, and has done shows like \u2018Banegi Apni Baat\u2019, \u2018Des Mein Niklla Hoga Chand\u2019, \u2018Astitva\u2026Ek Prem Kahani\u2019, \u2018Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai\u2019 and many others. On performing difficult scenes in the series, Varun, who portrays the role of K. D. Bansal, said: \u201cI feel when we talk about acting, we end up glorifying things out of proportion. I\u2019m not saying you wouldn\u2019t have to face difficult scenes, but after 25 years of acting, it becomes second nature. When acting becomes your practice, difficult things become easy. I believe no scene is challenging if it is backed by good preparation.\u201d Sharing insights into his preparation for \u2018Jamnapaar\u2019, the \u2018Mere Dad Ki Dulhan\u2019 actor said: \u201cI mentally prepared myself for the role because I had to portray a father who is much older than my actual age. It was important for me to understand the mindset of someone who has been in the business industry for thirty years, which required me to limit my thinking.\u201d \u201cAs an actor, I\u2019ve had many experiences, but playing this character required me to hold back, which was mentally challenging at times. It was crucial to ensure that my personal life did not clash with the character\u2019s life. These small details required time and attention, including studying the character\u2019s speech and mannerisms. Nonetheless, I enjoyed playing this role,\u201d he added. The show features Ritvik Sahore, Srishti Ganguli Rindani, Ankita Sahigal, and Raghu Ram in pivotal roles. \u2018Jamnapaar\u2019 is streaming on Amazon miniTV. \u2013IANS sp/kvd", "summary": "Mumbai, May 29 (IANS) Actor Varun Badola opened up on performing difficult scenes in the web series &#8216;Jamnapaar&#8217;, sharing that after 25 years of acting, facing intense scenes becomes second nature.

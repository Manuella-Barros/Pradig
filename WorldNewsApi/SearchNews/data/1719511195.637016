Multiple law enforcement agencies have responded to reports of unruly teenagers on bikes riding recklessly on streets. The teens typically ride together in large groups along the Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach strands near the piers. Some bystanders said they\u2019ve been assaulted or harassed by the bikers as they ride recklessly around town. \u201cIt seems like they don\u2019t pick on people who would be able to take them,\u201d said Michael Marino, a Redondo Beach resident. \u201cThey\u2019ll pick easy targets.\u201d Social media videos of the bikers show many are often traveling at excessive speeds.

Recently, police confirmed they\u2019ve written dozens of citations and have impounded electric motorcycles and pocket bikes being operated illegally. Longtime residents said the issue has become more notable over the past few months. \u201cI\u2019ve seen groups of them messing with people, harassing people, yelling profanities and even beating on people,\u201d said Marino. \u201cYou want to mess around as a kid and stuff, but I feel like it\u2019s a lot of freedom and responsibility to have one of those [e-bikes] because it\u2019s basically like a motorcycle.\u201d Other neighbors noted there doesn\u2019t seem to be much policing of e-bike riders and those who violate the rules of the road. \u201cYou\u2019re giving kids the opportunity to hurt themselves,\u201d said Shayne Mclaughlin, a Redondo Beach resident. \u201cThere\u2019s no real regulations. You have law enforcement with their hands tied. They\u2019re either doing serious crimes and having to work that or trying to battle these violations with these youth.\u201d \u201cEven today, I experienced a few kids who seemed to have kind of an, \u201cI don\u2019t care attitude,\u201d said Victor Leon, a Redondo Beach resident. \u201cIf you\u2019re driving a car and you get pulled over for speeding or drinking and driving, you\u2019ll get taken in and they take your vehicle. I think if you do that a few times, then maybe [the bikers] will get the message.\u201d Authorities have continued monitoring the areas for any \u201creckless and illegal behavior\u201d including patrolling neighborhoods, local schools, parks, the strand and beaches. With the summer months coming up, police said they expect to see an uptick in belligerent activity from these bike crews. \u201cWe are absolutely listening to the community\u2019s concerns and are doing everything possible to proactively enforce reckless riding of e-bikes and motorcycles throughout the city,\u201d said Hermosa Beach police. Councilmembers in Manhattan Beach previously voted to ban e-bikes from being ridden on sidewalks, plazas, the Greenbelt and grass areas, instituting a 15-mile-per-hour speed limit and fines of up to $1,000. Anyone who spots a biker harassing bystanders or riding on the roads recklessly is asked to report the incident to local law enforcement. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

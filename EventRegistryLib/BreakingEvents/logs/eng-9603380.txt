Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nTourists eager to see Japan's Mount Fuji have already started poking holes in a new barrier designed to prevent bad behaviour at a popular panoramic spot.\n\nThe installation of a black mesh screen in Fujikawaguchiko was only completed one week ago, and was carried out by officials in Yamanashi prefecture after locals became increasingly frustrated with the influx of foreign visitors who were littering, trespassing and breaking traffic rules in a bid to capture social media worthy perfect photos.\n\nA security guard, stationed at the Lawson's convenience store where the viewing spot has been blocked off, said he noticed small holes started appearing in the morning or evening while no one was watching.\n\n\"It's about manners. It's a shame,\" the security guard told the AFP news agency. He said the holes were big enough for fingers to go through but still not for a camera to capture an Instagram-worthy shot showing Fuji's snow-capped volcano.\n\nA town official said he tried to put a camera against one of the holes but did not manage to get a perfect shot. \"Did I take a good picture? In fact, I think the net came into the frame,\" the official said.\n\nTired of crowding and unruly tourists, officials in the Japanese resort town last week installed netting measuring 20m by 2.5m, which they say has proved effective.\n\n\"There have been some people who came to see the screen itself. But we have achieved the purpose of discouraging people from staying there,\" the town official said.\n\nThe narrow street in question offers a view of the perennially snow capped mountain soaring above a branch of the Lawson's convenience store chain. Local residents say the large numbers who flock to the spot often park illegally or block other pedestrians from using the pavement, and even cause accidents.\n\nOnce the photo booth-like spot in front of the convenience store loses popularity, the black screen might go away, the town official said.\n\nIn the meantime, they are now planning to install QR codes on the netting screen linking to information on other tourist spots for visits, including alternative places from which to take photos of Mount Fuji.\n\nTravellers have returned in huge numbers to Japan since it reopened to foreign tourists following the pandemic lockdown, with more than three million per month visiting in March and April 2024 - a new record, and part of a trend that seems likely to continue.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujikawaguchiko", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fujikawaguchiko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Fuji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanashi_Prefecture", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yamanashi Prefecture"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yamanashi Prefecture"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resort_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resort town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/28/10/GettyImages-2153387263.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603380", "eventUri": "eng-9603380", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It's obviously an iconic shot,\" said Christina Roys, 36, a tourist from New Zealand.\n\n\"But it's completely understandable. We were here last night, managing to get the last shot before they were putting up the wall, and there were so many people,\" she said.\n\nThe netting is also intended to provide some respite to the nearby Ibishi Dental Clinic, where tourists would park without permission and even climb onto the roof for photos, reported The Japan Times.\n\n\"It became not uncommon for people to shout insults at us or to throw away their cigarettes while they were still lit when we asked them to move their cars,\" the clinic told CNN in a statement.\n\nFujikawaguchiko is a Japanese resort town in the Yamanashi prefecture, about 100km west of Tokyo.\n\nTravellers have returned in huge numbers to Japan since it reopened to foreign tourists following the pandemic lockdown, with more than three million per month visiting in March and April 2024 - a new record, and part of a trend that seems likely to continue.\n\nWhile poorly behaved tourists are a problem in many popular tourist destinations around the world - Venice has begun charging day visitors a five-euro entry fee and Greece has capped the number of visitors to the famed Acropolis in Athens- the particular issue for Fujikawaguchiko is that people typically only come into the small town for a day trip to take a photo at that particular spot. Tourists then tend to return to Tokyo, which means that Fujikawaguchiko's local economy doesn't significantly benefit from the visitors.\n\n\"I've seen people walk into roads, people using electronic [scooters] without following traffic rules and getting into accidents. There have been many accidents involving foreign tourists recently,\" Haruhito Tsuchiya, a 49-year-old local who works in the tourism industry, told Reuters.\n\nThe town decided to put up the mesh in April, after signs and security guards failed to deter tourists.\n\n\"It is regrettable that we had to take such measures,\" an official had said at the time.\n\n\"Overtourism - and all the subsequent consequences like rubbish, rising CO2 emissions and reckless hikers - is the biggest problem facing Mount Fuji,\" Masatake Izumi, a Yamanashi prefectural government official, had said to CNN last year.\n\nAuthorities have also started a new online booking system for the Yoshida trail on Mount Fuji, capping daily hiker entries to 4,000 and imposing a mandatory fee of 2,000 yen.", "source":

But the town of Fujikawaguchiko was fed up with unruly tourists and announced they would be making the barrier last month.\n\nThe town, located on the island of Honshu, wanted to prevent overcrowding by tourists who were also littering and ignoring traffic rules. A town official told Agence France-Press that the decision to install the barrier was \"regrettable\" but necessary because \"some tourists can't respect rules.\"\n\nBut despite spending 1.3 million yen ($8,275) on the 66-foot-long screen, no sooner had it been installed than a hole was made. As of this morning, Japanese officials have found 10 holes, all at eye level, that are all exactly the right size to fit a camera lens\n\n\"It's about manners. It's a shame,\" a local official tells Agence France-Presse. However, he added that the holes aren't quite big enough to completely banish the net from the shot.\n\n\"I tried to put a camera up to one of the holes,\" he adds. \"In fact, I think the net came into the frame.\"\n\nThe holes appeared despite a security guard being there from 10:00 to 16:00. But tourists clearly vandalized the net when nobody was around.\n\nThe town officials add that \"there have been some people who came to see the screen itself\". But he stands by the screen's installation believing that the town is discouraging tourists from coming.\n\nThere is a QR code on the net that gives information about other tourist attractions in the area which also includes alternative views of Mount Fuji.\n\nAlthough many areas of the world are desperate for tourists, for others it has reached saturation and locals no longer want visitors.\n\nFujikawaguchiko may have taken notes from the Austrian town of Hallstatt, Austria which has also built a fence to stop tourists from taking selfies in front of the picturesque Salzkammergut Mountains which is believed to have inspired Disney's Frozen.\n\nIn March, the city of Kyoto sought ways to prevent \"paparazzi\" tourists from taking photos of Geishas. Monthly visitors to the island nation eclipsed three million people in March for the first time on record.\n\nAnd in Italy, Venice have started charging daily visitors to enter the city.

Literally.\n\nA week after a giant black mesh barrier was mounted in Fujikawaguchiko to block a popular view of Mount Fuji in the background of a convenience store, local authorities are reporting that around 10 small openings have been made in the barrier.\n\n\"It's about manners. It's a shame,\" a local official told Agence France-Presse -- though he added that the finger-sized holes seemed too small to actually take good photos. \"I tried to put a camera up to one of the holes,\" he said. \"In fact, I think the net came into the frame.\"\n\nThe barrier, measuring 2.5 meters (8 feet) high and 20 meters (22 yards) wide, was put up last week after local residents and business operators were driven to their wits' end by camera-toting tourists seeking to capture their own version of a social-media famous shot of Japan's tallest mountain peeking from behind a Lawson store -- usually taken from across the road.\n\nThe virality of the photo spot became a headache for locals as tourists parked their cars without permission, left litter behind, and frequently jaywalked. \"It was frightening because many tourists would jump out onto the road,\" one resident told Kyodo News.\n\nSome tourists even climbed onto the rooftop of a nearby dental clinic to try to get the best shot. \"It became not uncommon for people to shout insults at us or to throw away their cigarettes while they were still lit when we asked them to move their cars,\" the dental clinic said in a statement earlier this month.\n\n\"They've come from across the world, so I want them to get good photos, but I can't put up with this situation,\" the head of the clinic, who had installed his own fence to deter tourists, told Japanese newspaper the Mainichi.\n\nBefore the barrier was erected, the convenience store had put up signs in multiple languages warning tourists not to jaywalk. Security guards were also stationed in the area to try to maintain orderliness.\n\nThe barrier came as a last resort, and authorities said they would attach to it QR codes directing visitors to alternative photo spots nearby. Some tourists have already found other places to flock to, including a different Lawson that offers a similar view.\n\nJapan has recently experienced record tourism numbers amid pandemic recovery and a weakened yen. But the influx of visitors is posing some problems for locals, including driving up food prices and overwhelming certain popular locations. Officials overseeing trails up Mount Fuji implemented a daily cap on hikers earlier this month.\n\nIn Fujikawaguchiko, during the days leading up to the installation of the barrier, tourists rushed to the site to catch a final glimpse of the view. Now that the barrier has gone up, however, it may not be the panacea local residents had hoped for: some tourists are instead paying visits to the black mesh itself, which has garnered international media attention. But all things considered, the official told AFP, \"we have achieved the purpose of discouraging people from staying there.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "koh_ewe@time.com", "name": "Koh Ewe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujikawaguchiko", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fujikawaguchiko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Fuji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convenience store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyodo_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyodo News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Globalization", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Photography", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Japan-Tourism-Mount-Fuji-Barrier-Holes.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603380", "eventUri": "eng-9603380", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

the material - with the openings said to be just the right size to fit a camera lens through.\n\nOfficials in Fujikawaguchiko, a popular spot for those hoping to photograph the mountain on the island of Honshu, installed the black mesh net last week in a bid to prevent overcrowding caused by tourism.\n\nThe town spent 1.3 million yen (\u00a36,485) on the screen which is 8.2ft high (2.5 metres) and 66ft (20 metres) long.\n\nHowever, a hole was discovered in the material the next day.\n\nOfficials had found around 10 similar holes, all at eye level, and all apparently just the right size to fit a camera lens through, by this morning.\n\nOne especially popular viewing location is outside a Lawson convenience store, from where photos taken at a certain angle make it look as if Mount Fuji is sitting on top of the roof of the building.\n\nLocal residents have complained about visitors blocking the narrow pavement, walking into the busy road or standing on somebody's property to get their shots, officials said.\n\nDespite the holes, officials have said the net, which was installed along with additional fencing, has helped ease the pressures of overtourism in the town.\n\nOvertourism refers to when those living in an area, or those visiting, feel the experience has become worse because of the amount of tourists there.\n\nIt's a problem all over the world, with many destinations putting measures in place to help limit the impact of visitors.\n\nHow are other countries tackling overtourism?\n\nVenice in Italy has introduced a scheme whereby tourists have to pay a \u20ac5 fee (\u00a34.28) to enter the heart of the island city on certain days in spring and summer.\n\nThe city is visited by an estimated 30 million tourists a year - putting a strain on historic infrastructure and reducing the quality of life for people who live there.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhy 2024 could be the worst year ever for overtourism?\n\nPopular global destinations which are trying to limit tourism numbers\n\nMeanwhile, in the Canary Islands in Spain, officials are considering introducing stricter tourism rules amid simmering anger among locals who are worried about increasing visitor numbers.\n\nCanary Islands president Fernando Clavijo said this month that although the region was a leading Spanish tourist destination, more controls were needed.\n\nIn April, thousands of people protested in Tenerife, calling for the Spanish island to temporarily limit tourist arrivals.\n\nThey want to dampen a boom in short-term holiday rentals and hotel construction which is driving up housing costs for locals.\n\nIt comes as parts of Machu Picchu in Peru, one of the world's most popular heritage sites, were temporarily closed to tourists last September.\n\nAuthorities took the decision amid growing concern over the deterioration of the site due to increasing footfall.\n\nThe site was built in the 15th century as a religious sanctuary for the Incas.", "source": {"uri":

The Wolf of Wall Street Year: 2013 Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie Genre: Comedy, Drama Rating: R Runtime: 180 minutes Director: Martin Scorsese Trailer: Watch here The best thing about The Wolf of Wall Street? It doesn\u2019t give a sh*t. Martin Scorsese\u2019s hilarious adaptation of Jordan Belfort\u2019s life and career as a wealthy stock-market manipulator brought out another side of his directing style and another unexpected side of Leonardo DiCaprio. With the help of effortlessly funny co-stars Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, DiCaprio finally lets loose and allows himself to be funny. Fortunately, he is just as good at it as he is at drama, if not better. 8. Coming 2 America Year: 2021 Cast: Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, Shari Headley Genre: Comedy Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 110 minutes Director: Craig Brewer Trailer: Watch here The streaming realm gifted us with this long-awaited followup to the 1988 comedy hit. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are obviously the crowning jewels of the returning cast with Murphy\u2019s Prince Akeem heading back to New York for familial matters. Leslie Jones portrays the mother of his (illegitimate) biological child, and Tracey Morgan is here to crank the comedy factor even higher. Meanwhile, Wesley Snipes is on a quest to rule Zamunda by overthrowing Akeem, so there are lots of balls in the air, and damn, they\u2019re all too funny.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/saltburn1024x450.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=450&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"Saltburn\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/saltburn1024x450.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/saltburn1024x450.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/saltburn1024x450.jpg?resize=704,309 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/saltburn1024x450.jpg?resize=768,338 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">MGM</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tHere's your in-depth guide to the 25 best movies on Amazon Prime available to stream on the platform right now.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/tv/best-movies-on-amazon-prime/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-29-at-10.31.18-AM.jpg?w=982", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:15:00", "author": "Carrie Wittmer", "authors": ["Carrie Wittmer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.284}

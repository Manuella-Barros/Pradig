Nine All-Star selections, six All-NBA teams and four All-Defensive teams are just some of George's many individual accolades. One thing he hasn't done that he hopes to finally check off his list this season after signing with the Philadelphia 76ers: win a championship.\n\nGeorge recently broke down why he thinks this year's 76ers team can go all the way on the most recent episode of his podcast, Podcast P.\n\n\"I think Nick Nurse is as good as it gets in coaching,\" George said. \"He's won at many different levels. I've already talked about how good Joel [Embiid] is, Tyrese [Maxey] is, now you mix in myself, [Kelly] Oubre, I think we have a hell of a starting five. Then we've got veteran guys coming off the bench, so we already have the recipe to be a really good team. Everybody wants to win, we have a good mixture of veterans and young guys. I think Jared McCain will help, a really good player out of college. It's just a good mixture of everything.\"\n\nGeorge, who signed a four-year, $212 million contract earlier this offseason with the 76ers, is hoping to be the missing piece to a Philadelphia core that has failed to advance beyond the second round of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nIt's clear this team has talent, and George broke down exactly why he thinks this year is going to be different, both for himself and for the 76ers.\n\nAre the Paul George-led 76ers title contenders?\n\nGeorge's first reason why the 76ers are title contenders is about Nurse, his new head coach. Nurse is an NBA champion, one of the NBA's top tacticians, and arguably the most accomplished head coach Paul George has ever played for.\n\nNext, Embiid and Maxey are also two elite running-mates for George and will help him form one of the top big threes in the NBA. George has had a lot of great teammates throughout his career, like Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, and James Harden, but Embiid is far and away the best big man George has ever shared the court with. Playing alongside an All-NBA-level big like Embiid will give George more space to operate than he's had in his career.\n\nGeorge then shouts out two of the 76ers' role players, Oubre Jr. and McCain, along with the rest of Philadelphia's bench.\n\nWhile this 76ers team may not be as top-heavy as last year's Clippers team with George, Leonard, Westbrook, and Harden, George is still enthusiastic about their title chances. The next few years are likely George's last chances to be a major contributor on a contending team. The pressure is definitely there for George.\n\nIf Embiid, Maxey, and George stay healthy, they should be able to compete with anyone in the NBA. However, it will still be very difficult for both George and the rest of the 76ers to exercise their recent playoff demons in a loaded Eastern Conference featuring the reigning-champion Boston Celtics, new-look and healthy New York Knicks and the Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard-led Milwaukee Bucks.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_korn@clutchpoints.com", "name": "David Korn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nick Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/07-17-24-paul-george-featured-image.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748268", "eventUri": "eng-9748268", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Despite facing several injuries throughout his career, seven-time NBA All-Star Joel Embiid has achieved many accomplishments, including winning the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 2023.\n\nIn the 2023-24 season, he missed multiple games due to a lateral meniscus injury in his left knee, which occurred when Jonathan Kuminga of the Golden State Warriors fell on his knee while diving for a ball. During a recent episode of ESPN's NBA Today, former NBA star Kendrick Perkins made audacious remarks about Embiid's health for the forthcoming NBA season. He emphasized why Embiid is under unparalleled pressure in the NBA.\n\n\"We're talking about going into this 2024-25 season? He's under the most pressure. He's under Jayson Tatum-type pressure. There's no other player in the league who's under the most pressure like Joel Embiid. When you look at the list of bigs around the NBA that you put him in the same conversation with - Anthony Davis, he has an NBA championship. Nikola Jokic has an NBA championship. Giannis Antetokounmpo has an NBA championship.\" Perkins said.\n\nAccording to Perkins, the 76ers have made significant offseason moves by hiring Nick Nurse, re-signing Tyrese Maxey, and adding star player Paul George. Moreover, Perkins believes that Embiid will be under great pressure as he is surrounded by these amazing players. Also, there will be high expectations for him to win the championship next season.\n\n\"When you think about those teams, the Bucks, they made the necessary moves to get the pieces. Jrue Holiday at the time, to make sure Giannis secured a championship. We know what the Denver Nuggets did, surrounding and getting pieces to fit around Jokic. Philly has done that this offseason and over the past two seasons. Bringing in Nick Nurse, re-signing Tyrese Maxey, signing Paul George, and re-signing KJ Martin. The list goes on. He has the necessary pieces to get it done. He's under the most pressure in the NBA for players to go out there and win big this season.\" Perkins added.\n\nStephen A. Smith made some startling remarks about Embiid in a recent interview. Moreover, Smith praised Embiid's skill and asserted that he is one of the \"greatest talents in basketball history\" for the Sixers.\n\nAlso Read: Anthony Davis Posterizing Joel Embiid During the Practice Has Everyone Divided on Social Media Regarding the Starting Lineup of Team USA", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afshan_khan@totalprosports.com", "name": "Afshan Khan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Any shortcoming on his end will force a serious reappraisal from both fans and the organizations about his quality.\n\nWhat To Expect From Embiid-George-Maxey Big Three Next Season?\n\nAt the time of this writing, Joel Embiid is currently with Team USA, as they prepare to go to the Olympics and win their fifth consecutive gold medal. Embiid opened up about how his injuries from the previous season have been affecting him, and it appears that they shouldn't be a long-term concern for the 76ers.\n\nA big three of Embiid, Paul George, and Tyrese Maxey is as good as any trio in the Eastern Conference. And if they all click the way the 76ers are hoping, they do have a good chance at making it past the second round of the playoffs, something they have struggled to do throughout Embiid's tenure with the 76ers.\n\nThere might be some questions about the 76ers being able to reach the NBA Finals, as the Knicks and the Celtics also have really strong teams in the Eastern Conference, and will require a lot of work to get past. But with all three players healthy and playing at their best, they have a very good chance to do just that. Considering the injury histories of both Embiid and George however, that is a very big 'if'.\n\nRelated: 5 NBA Teams That Improved The Most And 5 Teams That Regressed The Most In The 2024 Offseason\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

The City of Brotherly Love can't wait to witness the prized Wing in action during the upcoming season. With Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey running major scoring operations, a two-way star like George can become the missing piece to an elusive 76ers Championship run. On that note, 76ers Head Coach Nick Nurse explained how he envisions George to fit in his schemes.\n\nOn Sirius XM, Nurse pointed out that while the squad had the elite services of Maxey at the guard spot and Embiid at the Center position, they were lacking someone who could make a huge impact as a scoring forward. George fills that void.\n\nThe 56-year-old lauded the multi-faceted game that PG-13 brings to the table. The two-way Wing can be a superb shot-creator, a reliable option in crunch time, while bringing veteran presence and experience to the team. Nurse explained,\n\n\"We kinda have Tyrese [Maxey] at the 1, Joel [Embiid] at the 5, kinda as the bookends of the team. We needed something in the middle, as a scoring Wing and he is certainly that. I think he is certainly capable of playing both ends. I think he is capable of being a big shot-maker, late game shot-maker, and he is an experienced guy that can put it in the bucket in a lot of levels.\"\n\n\"He can post you a little bit, he can shoot the three, he can handle, and all that kind of stuff. So, super excited,\" the veteran HC added.\n\nPaul George is surely an upgrade over 76ers' previous forward option Tobias Harris. While Harris did bring defensive chops alongside some off-the-ball scoring, George is a more effective scorer and a better defender as well.\n\nApart from George, the 76ers made another remarkable signing with Caleb Martin. Martin is a stable two-way Wing who might not be as effective as PG-13, but brings terrific balance. Therefore, the 76ers can roll out a starting lineup with a couple of Wings who can be a headache.\n\nKelly Oubre Jr. as the off-guard brings great scoring chops, which means that the 76ers have surely upgraded their offense compared to last year.\n\nKyle Lowry and Eric Gordon as backcourt partners means a lot of veteran leadership off the bench. Meanwhile, Andre Drummond at the Center is a brilliant backup to Embiid. As for the other bench players, rookie Jared McCain and sophomore Ricky Council IV have a solid case as injury fillers.\n\nBut one downside of having a veteran roster is the injury toll. Embiid is highly injury-prone. On the other hand, as a 34-year-old, George's body has also gone through massive wear and tear. If these two are injured at the same time, then the 76ers are going to have huge problems on both ends of the floor.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Shubham Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobias Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Martin_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Martin (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Drummond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Drummond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/5807953b-nba-2024-07-18t021407.597.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748268", "eventUri": "eng-9748268", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He played only 39 regular season games and struggled with injuries in the Philadelphia 76ers' first-round loss to the New York Knicks in the playoffs. The franchise would've wanted Embiid to rest and recuperate in the offseason, but the center is heading to Paris to represent Team USA in the Olympics. While his participation is not optimal from the 76ers' point of view, Nick Nurse isn't too worried.\n\nDuring an interview on SiriusXM NBA Radio, the 76ers head coach downplayed concerns about Embiid not getting enough time to recover ahead of the new season. He insisted that he was thrilled that the center was picked to represent the nation at the Olympics. Nurse added that spending time with former champions, Finals MVPs, and the league's top stars would be a great learning experience for Embiid and help him improve as a player. He said,\n\n\"I think it's great for him right now... I think it's going to be good for him... I was looking at that list today and it's like eight MVPs on the roster, 15 championships, being around that stuff. I love international settings. I think it's always great for guys to be around that.\"\n\nWhen asked whether the additional wear and tear from playing in the Olympics during the offseason would cause an issue for Embiid late in the NBA season, Nurse replied he has plans to ensure the center remains healthy throughout the campaign. However, the coach did warn the former MVP that the onus would be on him to stay in shape.\n\nThe 76ers have signed Andre Drummond to help take the load off Embiid during the regular season. Paul George's addition should also lessen the burden on the 30-year-old center to carry the team. However, come playoff time, he'll have no excuse.\n\nPhiladelphia is touted as one of the favorites alongside the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks to represent the East in the NBA Finals. The front office has done a tremendous job surrounding Embiid with the right pieces. In addition to George and Drummond, they've signed Caleb Martin and Eric Gordon. They've also handed out contract extensions to Tyrese Maxey, Kelly Oubre Jr., and Kyle Lowry.\n\nThe 76ers have been one of the biggest spenders during this offseason. They are determined to end their 41-year wait for an NBA title, but their fortunes hinge on Embiid and his health. If the center can stay fit, Philadelphia has a legitimate opportunity to end its title drought. However, if he struggles to remain healthy, it'd be another promising campaign down the drain.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Drummond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Drummond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/12509c1c-untitled-design-60.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748268", "eventUri": "eng-9748268", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Many see the upcoming season as his opportunity to even the score with the other top big men around the league, such as Nikola Jokic, Anthony Davis, and Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nEmbiid appeared in just 39 games last season, averaging 34.7 points, 11 rebounds, and 5.6 assists on 52.9% shooting. These stats may have dropped with more appearances, but the near-consensus opinion is Embiid would have landed his second MVP if he met the games played requirement.\n\nAt 30 years old, this is Embiid's best shot to prove himself as a winner, having arguably the best-constructed roster of his career.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/USATSI_22050872%20%281%29.jpg?itok=3fCGBGnl", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748268", "eventUri": "eng-9748268", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Utah Jazz want picks! Two first round picks could get it done. If the [Golden State] Warriors don't get something done, Philly is at the top of list & he'd fit like a glove! Imagine a world where you've got Embiid, PG13, Maxey & Lauri!\"\n\nThe issue with this potential package is it's hard to imagine the Warriors wouldn't outbid this offer. Not only do they have equal amounts of draft capital, but also young players such as Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski. Although the talent of the Sixers' top four would be the strongest since the 2017 Warriors, it may not come in their best interest.

The 76ers added George in the offseason as they are looking to compete and win an NBA championship next season.\n\nLet's dive into each selection they made and the summary of their draft.\n\nWith their middle pick of the first round, the 76ers selected Jared McCain out of Duke. The 6-foot-3 guard is an elite shooter who has exceptional shot mechanics, shot preparation and elite touch. His quick release and elite shooting ability forces opposing defenders to smother him which will naturally open up the floor for his other teammates.\n\nMcCain is more than just an elite spot-up shooter as he's also a very talented shot-maker off the dribble. He plays with a ton of confidence and is a born scorer. An underrated skill that McCain possesses is that he's very good out of the pick and roll as he has a good change of speed and uses the ball screens quite well.\n\nThe major weakness in McCain's game is that lacks burst and explosiveness which hurts his ability to create space from defenders off the dribble. His fit next to Embiid should be very, very good.\n\nWith their second-round pick the 76ers elected to add depth to the center position by selecting Adem Bona out of UCLA. The 6-foot-9 center has amazing physical tools. The center is very explosive and has outstanding mobility.\n\nHis length and athletic tools allow him to be a very good rim protector. Bona is a physical center that does the dirty work needed to make a positive impact on the floor. He's a lob threat at all times that scores efficiently inside the painted area.\n\nBona is a very good rebounder on both ends of the floor due to how high of a motor he plays with and is good positioning to get rebounds. His feel for the game is lacking a bit and he isn't very skilled but if his role is simplified in the NBA then he should get by as a backup center for someone like Embiid.\n\nThe 76ers signed one of the top undrafted prospects Justin Edwards to a two-way contract. The 6-foot-7 wing was born in Philadelphia and will be playing for his hometown team. He's a versatile wing who shot the ball at a high level at the end of the college season while also being a very good cutter. His physical tools give him some defensive potential. Edwards will spend most of his time in the G League but could eventually be a solid role player in the NBA.\n\nDavid Jones was another two-way signing by Philadelphia as they brought in an exciting scoring wing. The 6-foot-5 wing is very aggressive in scoring the ball and has consistently improved his shot-making ability each year in college. This past season at Memphis he had the ultimate green light and it's a big reason why he scored over 20 points per game. Jones will spend his time in the G League but could eventually carve out a role in the NBA with his scoring versatility.\n\nThe 76ers had a solid draft as they added young prospects who could carve out a role on their team with their clear-cut roles in the NBA. McCain is an elite shooter who could be a very good duo next to Maxey. The Duke product has a chance to be one of the top pure shooters in the NBA which is a big reason why he has drawn a ton of comparisons to Seth Curry.\n\nBona doesn't ever project to be a starter in the NBA but his high energy and defensive tools are quite enticing which will allow him to be a solid backup center. Philadelphia added young talent and guys who could potentially contribute in their year in the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adem_Bona", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adem Bona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-way contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seth Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3733,h_2099,x_0,y_139/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/nba_draft/01j34267862mezgh2e0h.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748268", "eventUri": "eng-9748268", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

I've spent half of my life here. I've got a great family, great wife, my son, so it just made a lot of sense. I've been given the opportunity to be here and accomplish a lot.\n\nI have dual citizenship -- Canadian and U.S. -- and soon I'll have lived in America for longer than I was in Canada. But it's clear to me that, for whatever reason, I will never self-identify as American. Do you have similar feelings? Do you think of yourself as American? Nah, I think of myself as from Cameroon. That's always going to be home. I was born there, and from what I've seen growing up -- the struggle -- I'll always identify with it. That's one of the reasons I ended up succeeding: because of the way I was raised, the environment I was raised in. Nothing was ever comfortable. I always felt like I got to work for everything. I started playing basketball at 16. [Embiid actually started playing at 15 but first played in America at 16.] It's hard to make it when you start that old, especially because guys have been playing their whole life in America.\n\nA lot of people thought you were going to play for the French team. You ultimately decided to play for the American team. Can you tell me how you wound up making that decision? It was tough. Obviously, I got my home country, Cameroon, which I love, and the U.S., where I've been for 14 years now, and then France, where I have a lot of family. I kind of felt rushed in that decision. I wanted to take as much time as possible, and it didn't help that France had put an ultimatum on when the decision had to be made.\n\nWhat was the timeline? I didn't know. You know, I saw it on Twitter, and I was like, Whoa, where did this come from? Because from the conversation that I had with the U.S., it was: Take as much as time as you need. We'd love to have you, but it's OK if you make another decision. Then when you've got someone else putting the pressure on you, making it seem like, Oh, you got to make the decision, we need it, we need it -- I'm like, well, I got one person over here telling me take as much time as you need. But one thing that was always known was that Cameroon is the first choice, and if they qualify I'm playing for my home country. I had the opportunity to talk to the French president about what was going on, and I told him one thing that was kind of bothering me a lot was the relationship between France and Cameroon and Africa's countries in general.\n\nHistorically, you mean? Yeah, and even right now. There's a lot of things going on over there. There's a lot of pushback as far as basically kicking out the French because it's been so many years of oppression. So that was my mind-set. I still got my family living in Cameroon, and I don't want to put them through any of that stuff. I want them to be safe, and the relationship between France and Cameroon or Africa in general is just not good.\n\nYou spoke to President Macron about this? Yeah.\n\nNo disrespect, but I would hope he has more important things to do than trying to convince basketball players to come play for the French team! But what did you say to him, and what did he say back? It was a nice conversation. I got a call, and at first -- I usually don't answer random numbers. I got a text, and I figured what was happening. We had a great talk.\n\nAre there ways in which having a son has changed how you think about your job? He changed everything. We had him in 2020, and before that, I was not a serious human being. I was always joking around; I was always saying whatever. I was always acting crazy. That was the golden days of my Twitter era.\n\nYou were famously a very good Twitter troll. Yeah, basically. Then once I found out I was having a kid, I was like, I got to set a better example. I can't just be on Twitter trolling. That can't be my life. My focus on basketball changed. Not that I wasn't taking it seriously before, but I took it to another level.\n\nExplain to me why having a child made you take basketball more seriously. Because for some people, the thought process might be: I have a kid now. Maybe basketball's not the most important thing. It was all about setting a good example. I think it came from my dad. Growing up, he was a handball player, and really good too. He was also in the army. I was always going to all his games and watching him competing and succeeding. That was like the bar for me. I always told myself, I want to be better than him. I don't want to put that pressure on my son, but if that's the way he wants to look at life, then he has to be the greatest player ever. Which, to me, it's all about health. If I was healthy in all the seasons, that would be a different conversation.\n\nIs the implication that you think you would be in the greatest-player-of-all-time conversation without the injury problems? I think so. I think I'm that talented. Obviously you need to win championships, and to win championships you need other guys. You can't do it by yourself. I want to win so bad. But if you don't, you just got to understand that as long as you care about the right stuff, if it doesn't happen, maybe it wasn't meant to happen. So, yeah -- I kind of forgot the question.\n\nThe question was whether you felt as if you were on a greatest-of-all-time trajectory. Yeah. If you think about it, the thing that stopped me all these years is just freak injuries. Every single playoffs, regular season, people falling on my knee or breaking my face -- twice. It's always freak injuries at the wrong time.\n\nMost of us can relate to wanting to achieve something and working hard at achieving something, and then through circumstances beyond our control -- in your case injuries -- not being able to. How have you learned to not get discouraged? Going back to how I was raised and where I came from: It's always about pushing, wanting to be better for yourself. There's only one injury that kind of put me -- it was this past year, where mentally and physically it was tough. But every other one was always about, like, What am I supposed to do about it? It's life, you know? Then this past year -- you play your best basketball of your career, and it's becoming so easy. Every single night. You're winning games and dropping 40, 50, 60. You finally got it figured out. You have an answer for everything that's presented to you on the floor. Double-, triple-teamed, you just know where to go. The system is in place, and everybody's doing their job, and you're on your way to accomplish a lot of good things, and then just like that someone falls on your knee. I don't have any explanation for why it was so tough, but it just was. Mentally depressing, physically your body not responding the way it should.\n\nYou've been in Philly for about 10 years. I think you've had three coaches in that time, there's been front-office turnover, other star players have come and gone: James Harden, Jimmy Butler. Do you find yourself ever having questions about whether Philly is the place where you can win a championship? I'm sure everybody asks themselves questions if you care about the right things and you care about winning and it hasn't happened. Which, I'm probably at fault, too.\n\nWhy would you be at fault? Injuries. I don't perform at the level that I should. I could take the easy way out and not play through injuries, but I'm just like, I'll play. So that's all my fault probably because I haven't performed at times at the level that I know I can and I know I should. But then again, if you want to win, the thing that I always talked about is stability, continuity. Actually, having three coaches, based on what I've seen, is not too bad. But it's still three coaches, three different systems. Then the players: Every single year is like, new co-star, new players. When you start looking at the teams that have won, whether it's Golden State, Boston this year, Denver last year, those guys have been together for a long time and then just added a few other pieces that were able to take them over the top. You go through the years. The Jimmy [Butler] years: We had a pretty good team, and then we end up losing on a game-winning buzzer-beater against the eventual champion, Toronto.\n\nKawhi Leonard's shot: The ball bounced around the rim and went through, and you guys lost. The way I look at it is, like, you got so close, and instead of what can we do to make the team better but also having the same core -- changed the whole team. No continuity.\n\nYou mentioned Game 7 against Toronto in 2019. After that game, you were crying. For some people watching, that was an endearing moment. Probably some other people thought, We don't want to see athletes crying. For the whole Twitter world, that was a fun moment. They enjoyed that.\n\nWhat were they saying on Twitter? I don't know.\n\nDon't say you don't know. To this day, I still see the video and the meme. They make fun of it. Some people, they just saw it as a way to make fun of you. But I care. It hurts losing.\n\nWas that game a turning point for your demeanor on the court? Leading up to that, you had a more playful attitude, embraced the showmanship aspect a bit more. Then after it seemed as if you were more serious. 2020 was probably my worst year in the N.B.A. I wasn't having fun. Going back to continuity: We got rid of Jimmy and JJ [Redick] and basically started over. I'm just like: Why? That doesn't make sense. The following year, we're just struggling. We're not as good as we should be. The whole year I'm just like, I don't want to play basketball. I didn't care. It was just depressing. I wasn't there. Before that I used to interact with the fans, always laughing. Then I became more serious. I think a lot of people in Philadelphia think I don't care about basketball because I'm not doing what they're used to -- or I'm not having fun. Nah, I'm still having fun, but I'm just so focused. I don't have the energy to be interacting. I'm trying to do the job. I'm just different. I'm more serious. I'm more mature. So, yeah, it's a lot to think about. But I love Philly. I've been here for 10 years. It's looking like I'm going to be here for a long time and actually have the opportunity to finish my career here. If they'll let me.\n\nWhat's the best cheesesteak in the city? I don't eat cheesesteaks.\n\nYou don't eat cheesesteaks? No. You want to know the real answer? The best cheesesteak is Subway cheesesteak.\n\nSubway cheesesteak?! Everybody in Philadelphia who is dead is rolling over in their grave. I don't eat cheesesteaks. I've tried twice. I'll have my chef make a cheesesteak.\n\nMy understanding is that you have a disciplined personal life. You don't drink or do other stuff. Is it ever hard to fit into the culture of the league when you're playing with a guy like James Harden who's a famous partyer? Is there temptation? No, there's never any temptation. I don't drink, I don't smoke. Never in my life. To me, that's actually disgusting. Like, I hate the smell. I can't stand it. I don't know how people in the world deal with it. I just can't do it. But there's never been any temptation. Probably because of the way I was raised.\n\nYou lost your younger brother [in a car accident] when he was 13. You were 20. How did that experience affect your thinking about life? It changed a lot. Losing someone that young and someone that's so close to you, especially because you're not -- I wasn't around. I hadn't gone back to Cameroon since I got to the States, so I hadn't really seen him in a long time. So, yeah, it was tough going through it. For my family, my parents, my mom -- all of us to this day. But especially for my mom, it still seems pretty recent and pretty tough.\n\nDid it change your priorities? Yeah. I mean, family is very important. It made me not want to have three kids. It made me want to have four. Because there were three of us. I don't like that number three. I told my wife, better have four kids at least. Because two is too little and three is not -- I don't like that. And then in life, just cherishing and including family more in everything.\n\nIt's one of those things where it exposes the great lie of sports. We operate under this idea that professional sports is life and death. It's not. Even when it comes to winning: Everybody always asks me, How would you feel if you won a championship? I'm like: If it happens, it would be great. But if I didn't, what do you want me to do? It wasn't meant to be. It won't be for the lack of trying. I work hard. And if it doesn't happen, what do you want me to do after I retire? Cry about it? No. Life is bigger than basketball.\n\nEmbiid and I spoke again two days later.\n\nYou're a thoughtful guy, unassuming, and you have a gentle demeanor. But on the court, sometimes there's a boorish quality: drawing fouls and flopping or taking highly questionable fouls. It makes me wonder whether you feel as if you have to become a different person on the court from who you are normally. No, I think it's still the same because everything that I do in life, I compete. I want to win in everything that I do.\n\nDo you let your kid beat you? No. We play basketball sometimes, and he hates when I block him.\n\nYou block a 3-year-old? Got to learn while they're still young.\n\nYou talked about feeling more depressed this past season about being injured. Given your background growing up in a military family, as well as the pressures on athletes to not show vulnerability or admit weakness, did that make it hard for you to come to the realization that you were depressed? I don't know what depression is. Yeah, I felt like I was depressed, but I'll never tell you that I was actually going through depression. How can I say this? I believe in mental health, but I've never been one to admit I might be going through something like that. Like you said, the background, where I'm from, it's kind of hard to admit that something is going on.\n\nDo you feel like you can admit it now? No.\n\nGiven the tension between you and French basketball officials, what reaction do you expect from French fans in Paris? I expect a lot of boos. But I actually love it. It's not going to be anything I haven't seen.\n\nI think every athlete in the history of sports interviews has said that either he doesn't care about boos or likes it when fans boo. But, really, in your heart of hearts, when 20,000 people are booing, it doesn't bother you? It just makes you want to go even harder so you can shut them up. There's nothing better: They're booing, and you make a big shot, and the whole arena is quiet. That's the best feeling. You look around, you're like, I don't hear anymore, it's time to go home.\n\nYou played with JJ Redick. What do you think about his taking the Lakers job with no prior coaching experience? If I was him, I don't know if that's a perfect situation. Maybe he thinks that's a perfect situation. But if you're coming in, especially with a job like the Lakers, it's kind of a make-or-break situation, because if you succeed, great, you're going to be coaching for years. But if you don't succeed, those coaches are usually bound to be fired within a year or two. I love him, I'm happy for him, but that's a tough job.\n\nJust to go back to the Olympics: Do you have any doubt about who's going to win the gold medal? You look at the talent that the U.S. has, but there's equal talent on other teams. And the talent that's on the U.S. team, you also got to understand most of those guys are older. The LeBron now is not the LeBron that was a couple of years ago. So it's a big difference. Everybody would also tell you, and you can see for yourself, the athletic LeBron, dominant that he was a couple of years ago, is not the same that he is now. I think people get fooled by the names on paper. But those names have been built throughout their career, and now they're older. They're not what they used to be.\n\nBefore we go, I just wanted to say: You know the sports-media hot-take machine is going to go into overdrive because you said that if it hadn't been for injuries you'd be in the greatest-of-all-time conversation. That's OK because that's the truth. I mean, you think about what I've been able to accomplish and what has been taken away because of injuries. There's a lot of what-ifs, but if you combine collectively and individually, you can make the case of being up there.\n\nAlso, in the context of your younger brother, you talked about understanding that life is bigger than basketball. Do you think there's any way in which that understanding inhibits your will to win? If you know that winning is not the most important thing, does that hold you back? No. Because if it held me back, I would never play through injuries. I'd just be like, well, life is bigger than basketball. I understand that I live in the present, and the present means any chance that I get, go after it as far as winning. But also understanding that when I'm done, I should not have any regrets.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

capabilities.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian military experts, the F-16s are unlikely to be used in direct air combat with Russian aircraft over the front line, as Russia has built up a dense air defence network.\n\nIn addition, the Russian military is likely to attempt to destroy the F-16s at their bases in Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian defence forces have been urgently seeking help to repel frequent Russian airstrikes and attacks which have routinely targeted Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.\n\nIn his post on Sunday, the Ukrainian president stressed that the country has long been working with foreign supporters to \"close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and aircraft.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The long-awaited arrival of the Western-supplied jets should bolster the country's defenses, although Kyiv appears to have received too few of them so far to have an immediate impact on the battlefield.\n\n\"F-16s are in Ukraine. We did it,\" Mr. Zelensky said in a video posted on social media networks showing him at an air base addressing and meeting Ukrainian pilots. He was standing in front of two F-16s, and two more flew overhead as he spoke.\n\nAt the very least, the arrival of the jets will boost Ukrainians' morale, which has been dampened by months of slow but steady Russian advances on the battlefield and devastating attacks on the country's power grid.\n\nMr. Zelensky said Ukrainian pilots \"have already started using them for our country,\" but he did not say whether they had already flown combat missions in Ukraine. Nor did he say how many jets had arrived in the country.\n\nUkraine hopes the F-16s, highly versatile aircraft equipped with advanced radar systems and a variety of weapons, will help turn the tide on the battlefield, where Russia has held the upper hand for much of the past year.\n\nThe presence of the jets will pose a new threat to Russian pilots and help deter them from entering Ukrainian airspace to attack troops on the front line and in cities. The F-16s are also expected to improve Ukraine's ability to shoot down Russian missiles, easing the pressure on its weakened air defense systems.\n\nThe United States has agreed to arm the F-16s with missiles and other advanced weapons, which should help Ukraine conduct more long-range strikes behind Russian lines, said Nico Lange, a military expert and former German defense official.\n\nStill, a shortage of trained pilots and the limited number of jets will constrain their immediate battlefield impact, experts say.\n\nWestern officials said earlier this year that as few as six jets might arrive in Ukraine by the summer. About 20 Ukrainian pilots are expected to be capable of flying the jets this year, according to U.S. officials. That would allow Ukraine to deploy only about 10 F-16s in combat, given that each aircraft requires at least two pilots.\n\nJohn F. Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told the Ukrainian edition of Voice of America last week that the planes would be \"ready to fly by the end of the summer,\" adding, \"There's no reason to doubt that.\"\n\nThe deployment of the first F-16s caps more than two years of intense lobbying by Ukraine to acquire the American-made jets, which represent a significant upgrade over the Soviet-era aircraft that the Ukrainian Air Force has been using.\n\nInitially, the Biden administration resisted the request for the F-16s over fears of escalating the conflict. But it reversed its stance about a year ago, allowing Western allies to transfer the jets to Ukraine. Since then, Western countries have pledged about 80 jets to Kyiv, though the vast majority of them will arrive over the coming years.\n\n\"We often heard the words that this is impossible,\" Mr. Zelensky said on Sunday. \"But we have made possible what was our ambition, our defense need.\"\n\n\"Now it is a reality,\" he said of the jets' arrival. \"Reality is in our skies.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have warned that delays in deliveries of the F-16s could diminish the jets' impact on the battlefield, giving Russia time to adapt its tactics. In recent weeks, Russia has targeted Ukrainian air bases in an apparent effort to limit the use of the F-16s ahead of their arrival.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ukraine-Has-Received-F-16-Fighter-Jets-Zelensky-Says.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

defences and on the battlefield.\n\nRussia has been targeting bases that may house them and vowed to shoot them down so they will not impact the war.\n\nBuilt by Lockheed Martin, the F-16s had been on Ukraine's wish list for a long time because of their destructive power and global availability.\n\nThey are equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets and missiles.\n\nTalking to

expecting additional F-16s ... many guys are now training,\" he said.\n\nIt was important, he said, that Kyiv's allies found ways to expand training programs and opportunities for both Ukrainian pilots and engineering teams.\n\nUkraine has previously relied on an ageing fleet of Soviet-era warplanes that are outgunned by Russia's more advanced and far more numerous fleet.\n\nRussia has used that edge to conduct regular long-range missile strikes on targets across Ukraine and also to pound Ukrainian front line positions with thousands of guided bombs, supporting its forces that are slowly advancing in the east.\n\n\"This is the new stage of development of the air force of Ukraine's armed forces,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"We did a lot for Ukrainian forces to transition to a new aviation standard, the Western combat aviation,\" he added, citing hundreds of meetings and unrelenting diplomacy to obtain the F-16s.\n\n\"We often heard 'it is impossible' as an answer but we still made our ambition, our defensive need, possible,\" he said.\n\nIt remains unclear what missiles the jets are equipped with.\n\nA longer range of missile would allow them to have a greater battlefield impact, military analysts say.\n\nZelenskiy said he also hoped to lobby allied neighbouring countries to help intercept Russian missiles being launched at Ukraine through conversations at the Ukraine-NATO Council platform.\n\n\"This is another tool, and I want to try it, so that NATO countries can talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighbouring countries shooting down enemy missiles,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this decision is probably difficult for our partners, they are always afraid of excessive escalation but we are fighting that.\"\n\nGet the latest news from

A longer range of missile would allow them to have a greater battlefield impact, military analysts say.\n\nZelenskiy said he also hoped to lobby allied neighbouring countries to help intercept Russian missiles being launched at Ukraine through conversations at the Ukraine-Nato Council platform.\n\n\"This is another tool, and I want to try it, so that NATO countries can talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighbouring countries shooting down enemy missiles,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this decision is probably difficult for our partners, they are always afraid of excessive escalation but we are fighting that.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20 mm caliber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-at-an-undisclosed-location-with-the-f-16-jets-reuters-042037433-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=5xYJZVqa4eCwczWWteuUeZ1pBZ7gd9x8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow could consider launching strikes at facilities in NATO countries if they host the warplanes used in Ukraine.\n\nThe American-made F-16 is an iconic fighter jet that's been the front-line combat plane of choice for the NATO alliance and numerous air forces around the world for 50 years.\n\nAlthough new to Ukraine, the F-16s are actually older jets that have been donated by Western allies of Ukraine. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have committed to providing Ukraine with more than 60 of them over coming months in what could be a slow trickle of deliveries. Zelenskyy did not say how many F-16s have arrived in Ukraine or which countries they came from.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden gave the go-ahead in August 2023 for used F-16s to be deployed to Ukraine, though the U.S. won't be providing any of its own planes.\n\nThe F-16s will boost Ukraine's military strength, especially by upgrading its air defenses. But analysts say they won't turn the tide of the war on their own.\n\nRussia is making small but steady battlefield gains in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and its steady forward movement is adding up as Ukraine gradually yields ground.\n\nThe American-made F-16 is an iconic fighter jet that's been the front-line combat plane of choice for the NATO alliance and numerous air forces around the world for 50 years.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/08/04/Russia_Ukraine_War_F16_Zelensky_24617_c0-279-6680-4173_s1770x1032.jpg?7056fde5f96e11c04517944fc748a8d8db7ab16a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

They are equipped with a 20mm cannon and can carry bombs, rockets and missiles.\n\nTalking to reporters on the tarmac of an airfield, Zelensky said Ukraine still did not have enough pilots trained to use the F-16s or enough of the jets themselves.\n\n\"The positive thing is that we are expecting additional F-16s...many guys are now training,\" he said.\n\nIt was important, he said, that Kyiv's allies found ways to expand training programmes and opportunities for both Ukrainian pilots and engineering teams.\n\nUkraine has previously relied on an ageing fleet of Soviet-era warplanes that are outgunned by Russia's more advanced and far more numerous fleet.\n\n\"I think this decision is probably difficult for our partners, they are always afraid of excessive escalation but we are fighting that.\"", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=d74f4851-bda3-5fb1-a474-8b762ab63bba&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.8427&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.07865.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The fighter jets are expected to start flying sorties in Ukrainian skies soon and will be a much-needed boost to the country's current fleet of Soviet-era jets that are laboring to counter Russia's invasion.\n\nUnited States President Joe Biden gave the go-ahead in August 2023 for used F-16s to be deployed to Ukraine, though the U.S. won't be providing any of its own planes. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have committed to providing Ukraine with more than 60 of them over coming months in what could be a slow trickle of deliveries.\n\nThough Russia's recent battlefield gains have been incremental, its steady forward movement is adding up as Ukraine gradually yields ground.\n\nThe F-16s will enhance Ukraine's military strength, especially by upgrading its air defenses. But analysts say they won't turn the tide of the war on their own.\n\nThe F-16s will likely have three core missions, says Federico Borsari of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington.\n\nThey will seek to intercept Russian missiles and drones that have relentlessly bombarded Ukraine; suppress enemy air defense systems; and strike Russian troop positions and ammunition depots with air-to-ground missiles.\n\n'They will be able to affect some of the dynamics (of the war),' Borsari says.\n\nA lot of information about the F-16 deployment is classified, including what Western governments allow them to hit and what weapons they will send with the aircraft.\n\nThe F-16s could carry United Kingdom-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles with a range of more than 250 kilometers, potentially striking targets inside Russia. They might also get long-range air-to-air missiles that would threaten Russian bombers and fighter jets. The plane's advanced radars will allow Ukrainian pilots to pinpoint targets further away than they can in their MiG-29s, Su-27s and Su-24s.\n\nCommanding the skies is an essential part of a war's ground campaign, as planes offer air cover to troops. But supporting Ukrainian troop movements on the front line with ground attacks may be too risky for the F-16s, given Russia's sophisticated air defense systems.\n\nFILE - U.S. made F-16 fighter jets fly in the sky over Poland's capital as they take part in a massive military parade to celebrate the Polish Army Day, in Warsaw, Poland, Aug. 15, 2023.\n\nAt the very least, the fighter jets could have a psychological effect on Russian pilots, and offer a morale boost for Ukrainians toiling against the Kremlin's forces.\n\nWhat are the challenges for Ukraine?\n\nMarina Miron of the Defense Studies Department at King's College London ticks off a long list of challenges the F-16s will bring for Ukraine.\n\nThe roughly nine-month training in the U.S. and Europe for Ukrainian pilots amounted to a crash course compared with the usual three-year course for Western pilots in what Miron calls 'a very complex piece of machinery.' That will mean limitations on their performance.\n\nThe F-16s also require a large number of support personnel, such as skilled maintenance engineers, munitions loaders, intelligence analysts and emergency crews.\n\nUkraine must also establish a network of radar stations, reinforced hangars, a supply of spare parts and refueling systems. Quality airfields are also a must as the F-16 air intake is close to the tarmac and runs the danger of sucking debris and dirt into the engine.\n\n'So many associated issues need to be sorted out,' Miron says.\n\nUkrainian pilots with no combat experience in F-16s may shy away from engaging in dogfights.\n\nHow will Russia react?\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin would savor the image that destroying F-16s from NATO countries would bring.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday the F-16s will not be a 'magic pill' that changes the course of the conflict. He added that Russian authorities have already offered rewards to servicemen who destroy F-16s.\n\nThe Kremlin's forces will likely try to destroy the F-16s on the ground with long-range missiles. They have already been targeting Ukraine's limited number of suitable airfields.\n\nThe Ukrainians will need to park the F-16s in hardened hangars, disperse them between various locations, station decoy model aircraft and be ready to take off quickly in the event of an air raid warning, analysts say.\n\nUkraine has said it might keep some of the fighter jets at foreign bases to protect them from Russian strikes. That prompted a harsh response from Putin, who warned that any Western air base hosting the Ukrainian fighter jets would be a 'legitimate target' for the Kremlin's forces.\n\nU.S. officials said the F-16s would be based in Ukraine.\n\nIn the air, the Ukrainian F-16s will be up against Russia's formidable S-300 and S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile systems that can target multiple aircraft at a time. Russia's military also has what are estimated to be several hundred operational fighter jets, as well as sophisticated air surveillance radars.\n\nRussia's Su-35 fighter jet will be one of the biggest threats to the F-16, Borsari of CEPA says. It has a long-range radar that allows it to track and engage up to eight targets at a time across a wide area.\n\nEven so, the Russians are aware that they'll be up against a more formidable aircraft than they have met so far in the war and will likely adopt a more careful approach.\n\nHow will Ukraine protect the F-16s?\n\nAlthough Russian forces will try to strike the F-16s at the airbases where they are kept, Ukraine has robust defenses to protect the fighter jets against such attacks, says Ukrainian aviation expert Anatolii Khrapchynskyi.\n\nUkraine has robust capabilities 'to protect its airfields with anti-aircraft defenses to deflect (Russian) attacks,' Khrapchynskyi told The Associated Press. 'During the entire time since Russia has invaded Ukraine, it has been actively trying to hit Ukrainian airfields, but they have been somewhat unsuccessful.'\n\nKhrapchynskyi said the F-16s will significantly increase the capabilities of the Ukrainian Air Force to protect the country's air space from Russian attacks and increase the range that Ukraine can strike strategic targets in Russia.\n\n'With the acquisition of F-16 aircraft, we will be able to solve a number of problems that are currently hurting Ukraine. These include: Russia's massive missile attacks, its use of guided aerial bombs, and the deployment of S-300 installations in the border regions of Sumy and Kharkiv,' says Khrapchynskyi. 'We are talking about receiving F-16 aircraft, in my opinion, this will significantly help Ukraine to cope with the Russian aggression that is taking place now.'", "source": {"uri": "polandsun.com",

A longer range of missile would allow them to have a greater battlefield impact, military analysts say.\n\nZelenskiy said he also hoped to lobby allied neighbouring countries to help intercept Russian missiles being launched at Ukraine through conversations at the Ukraine-NATO Council platform.\n\n\"This is another tool, and I want to try it, so that NATO countries can talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighbouring countries shooting down enemy missiles,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this decision is probably difficult for our partners, they are always afraid of excessive escalation but we are fighting that.\"\n\n(Writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20 mm caliber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_reuters_29/29fcdd0bd4cde9edcdea689a7ce6379b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

A longer range of missile would allow them to have a greater battlefield impact, military analysts say.\n\nZelenskiy said he also hoped to lobby allied neighbouring countries to help intercept Russian missiles being launched at Ukraine through conversations at the Ukraine-NATO Council platform.\n\n\"This is another tool, and I want to try it, so that NATO countries can talk to Ukraine about the possibility of a small coalition of neighbouring countries shooting down enemy missiles,\" he said.\n\n\"I think this decision is probably difficult for our partners, they are always afraid of excessive escalation but we are fighting that.\"\n\n(Writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_mm_caliber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20 mm caliber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/7f5edd4/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F91%2F0181b039280d54b87b822014ec44e7%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK7305M%3A12024-08-04T133644Z_1_LYNXMPEK7305M_RTROPTP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-DENMARK-JETS.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Training alongside NATO allies proves transformative for Ukrainian pilots transitioning to F-16s. F-16 deployment signifies a significant shift in Ukraine's defense strategy, securing air corridors and demonstrating NATO support.\n\nThe long-awaited first shipment of F-16 fighter aircraft for Ukraine has finally arrived.\n\nThe news, first reported by Bloomberg, comes one year after the Vilnius NATO summit, led by Denmark and the Netherlands, which committed to a \"fighter jet coalition\" on Ukraine 's behalf, an agreement President Volodymyr Zelensky extolled as \"historic.\"\n\nWhile the undisclosed number of aircraft in this initial batch is believed to be relatively small, Ukraine is slated to acquire at least 79 F-16s from Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, and Belgium over the coming years.\n\nPhoto: Belgium Air Force\n\nIt's easy to understand why Ukraine is ecstatic over the delivery of the F-16 Fighting Falcons. According to the US Air Force:\n\n\"The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a compact, multi-role fighter aircraft. It is highly maneuverable and has proven itself in air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack. In an air combat role, the F-16's maneuverability and combat radius (distance it can fly to enter air combat, stay, fight and return) exceed that of all potential threat fighter aircraft.\n\n\"It can locate targets in all weather conditions and detect low flying aircraft in radar ground clutter. In an air-to-surface role, the F-16 can fly more than 500 miles (860 kilometers), deliver its weapons with superior accuracy, defend itself against enemy aircraft, and return to its starting point.\" - USAF\n\nRelated US Announces Dutch & Danish Governments Will Send F-16s To Ukraine This Summer\n\nMore than 70 aircraft commitments are currently outstanding in F-16 donations to Ukraine.\n\n1 Fighter jets and training too\n\nIn addition to providing Ukraine with the much-needed air power, the fighter jet coalition, comprised of Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, the UK, Greece, and the United States, is also committed to providing the necessary training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, technicians, and support personnel.\n\nIn addition to Ukrainian F-16 pilots already training in the US and abroad, a supplemental training hub has been established in Romania. The Netherlands, Romania, and Lockheed Martin are all contributing to its creation and maintenance.\n\nPhoto: Airman 1st Class Duncan Bevan | 1st Combat Camera Squadron | US Air Force\n\nThe coalition aims to provide an in-depth training program for Ukrainian personnel, from basic and elementary flight training to more specific F-16 training.\n\nFrom a Nokia to an iPhone\n\nWhile undoubtedly challenging, one of six Ukrainian F-16 pilots training in Denmark, call sign \"Moonfish,\" is more than up to the task. When asked by Business Insider to describe transitioning from a Russian MiG to the F-16, Moonfish quipped, \"...like a Nokia, straight to an iPhone, without all those steps in between.\n\n\"It's a really awesome jet to fly.\" - \"Moonfish,\" Ukrainian F-16 pilot in training\n\nMeanwhile, 12 Ukrainian pilots have been training on F-16s in the US with the Air National Guard's 162nd Wing in Tucson, Arizona. The first group of Ukrainian F-16 pilots graduated in May 2024 and will continue training overseas.\n\n\"A small number of pilots have finished their U.S.-based training and moved forward to the next portion of training outside the United States. Additional Ukrainian pilots continue to train in Arizona. While I cannot confirm specific details regarding the training schedules and locations of individual pilots, I can assure you that we continue to work closely with our Ukrainian partners to enhance their operational readiness and interoperability within NATO standards .\" - Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Charlie Dietz, Air & Space Forces\n\nRelated Top 5 Combat Achievements Of The F-16 Fighting Falcon\n\nThe famous fighter has been in deployment for more than four decades.\n\n1\n\nWhile the arrival of F-16s to Ukraine's arsenal isn't expected to cause a dramatic shift in the war, they provide Ukraine with air defenses they desperately need.\n\n\"F-16s with the right armaments will be able to push away Russian warplanes. The northwestern part of the Black Sea, particularly the corridor for civilian ships, will be almost 100% secure .\" - Commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice Admiral Oleksii Neizhpapa, Kyiv Independent\n\nPhoto: USAF\n\nThe arrival of F-16s in Ukraine marks a significant shift in the nation's defense strategy and offers renewed hope for the people of Ukraine. As the skies over Ukraine become guarded by these formidable aircraft, the country remains fortified and determined. Furthermore, the arrival of F-16s symbolizes the ongoing and unwavering support of NATO and Ukrainian allies.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"},

jets may strengthen Ukraine's air defense capabilities and shield the country's population centers from Russia's daily bombardments.\n\nNavy Commander Oleksii Neizhpapa said that the delivery of F-16s to Ukraine would also challenge Russia's \"full dominance\" of the skies over the Black Sea.\n\nDenmark and the Netherlands indicated that they would allow Ukraine to strike with F-16s inside Russia, although Copenhagen said that such a move would \"depend on the circumstances.\"", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [],

Now it is a reality. Reality in our skies. F-16s in Ukraine. We made it happen,\" Zelensky said, as some flew above him during the announcement.\n\nZelensky was standing in front of what looked like two grey, partially-covered F-16s branded with the Ukrainian trident, in a location reporters were asked not to disclose for security reasons.\n\n\"I am proud of all our guys who are mastering these aircraft and have already started using them for our country,\" he said.\n\nHe did not say how many jets had been delivered and declined to comment on their specific tasks, but AFP journalists saw at least two F-16s on the spot.\n\nThe announcement will likely be welcomed by many and comes as Kyiv's forces are struggling to hold back advances by Russian troops in recent weeks.\n\nKyiv hopes the arrival of the fighter jets -- touted for their precision, speed and range -- will enable it to better protect itself from Russian bombardment.\n\n- 'Not enough' -\n\nZelensky, however, immediately warned more were needed.\n\n\"Our partners know that the number of F-16s we have in Ukraine, the number of pilots who have already been trained, is not enough,\" he said.\n\n\"The good news is that we are expecting additional F-16s,\" he

said, thanking Denmark, the Netherlands, the US and other allies.\n\nAmid a Russian air campaign in recent months, President Volodymyr Zelensky has placed Ukraine's need for improved air defences at the top of his agenda in meetings with allies.\n\nDuring an interview with AFP in May, Zelensky said Ukraine needed around 130 F-16s to secure parity with Russian air power.\n\nUkraine's partners, however, have promised to send less than 100 F-16s to date, with most likely to arrive over the course of several years following substantial pilot training.\n\nRecent strikes on Ukrainian airfields have also raised questions about Kyiv's ability to protect the multi-million-dollar planes from Russian raids.\n\nIn early July, Russia claimed to have destroyed five military jets during a barrage on an air base in central Ukraine.\n\nFollowing the bombing, Ukrainian military correspondents lambasted the air force's top brass, saying planes at the airfield had been parked in the open without sufficient protection.\n\nUkraine's air force has long relied on a fleet of ageing Soviet-era MIG-29 and Sukhoi jets, which have increasingly come under strain following more than two years of demanding combat missions.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@kyivpost.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

He also thanked Ukrainian servicemen of the Air Force who have been protecting Ukrainian skies for two and a half years of the full-scale war and didn't allow Russians to take dominance in the sky despite much fewer means at Ukraine's Air Force disposal.\n\n\"Today we honor the strength and skill of our people, thanks to whom the skies of Ukraine remain Ukrainian...

And this is true heroism -- when our Air Force warriors had to confront the larger Russian air fleet, and yet Ukraine was able to achieve its goals, was able to defend itself, was able to destroy the occupier.\"\n\nAt the same time, he highlighted that the delivery of F-16s begins a new phase of Ukraine's Air Force's development. He noted that hundreds of meetings and negotiations were needed to make the delivery possible a year after the US finally agreed to greenlight the supply of the jets.\n\n\"We are now at a new phase in the development of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine...

We did it,\" President Zelensky said at a ceremony at a secret location, flanked by the jets.\n\nHe thanked Denmark, the Netherlands and the US in particular for helping deliver the jets following 18 months of waiting - though added that many more were needed.\n\nTheir arrival marks a crucial milestone in boosting the capabilities of Ukraine's air force, which largely relies on old Soviet-era jets.\n\nMr Zelensky did not specify how many aircraft had arrived in Ukraine - or whether they had all been sent by the three Nato countries he mentioned.\n\nSome 65 F-16s have been pledged by Nato countries since US President Joe Biden first authorised willing European allies to send them to Ukraine in August 2023.\n\nThe UK does not have any F-16s in its air force, though it is supplying long-range Storm Shadow missiles which can be fitted to the jets.\n\nThe F-16 was introduced in 1978. Many Western militaries are in the process of retiring the ageing fighters, replacing them with the US-made F-35, introduced in 2015.\n\nThe F-16s will work alongside a limited number of Western-supplied surface-to-air missile systems such as Patriot and NASAMS which are already on the ground.\n\nThis year Ukraine has been under huge threat from Russian glide bombs - bombs fitted with pop-out wing kits and guidance modules to deliver precision strike stand-off capabilities, similar to the JDAM munitions from the United States.\n\nAround 3,000 were dropped in March alone, mostly from Su-34 fighter-bombers.\n\nIf Ukraine can protect its F-16s on the ground, the hope is that they could play an important part in pushing back Russian aircraft to a point where they can no longer target Ukrainian ground forces with glide bombs.\n\nKyiv had suggested that it could keep some F-16s at foreign military bases, but that suggestion prompted President Vladimir Putin to warn that any Western bases storing Ukrainian jets would be a legitimate military target for Russia.\n\nExperts also say the fighters could provide much needed air support to Ukrainian ground forces, who have faced relentless attacks in recent months, especially in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nKremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov previously vowed that Western-made F-16s flying for Ukraine would be \"shot down\".\n\n\"But of course, these deliveries will not have any significant impact on the development of events on the front,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news",

The number of jets is small, they said.\n\nIt's not clear whether Ukrainian pilots, who have trained with their western allies over the past months, will be able to immediately use the warplanes or the process will take longer, the people said.\n\nEven if small at first, the transfer of jets should over time help Kyiv build the capacity to put a dent in Russia's aerial superiority, which has allowed the Kremlin to decimate the country's power infrastructure, leading to rolling blackouts.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ukraine's defense ministry Diana Davityan declined to comment. Spokespeople for US Department of Defense and the National Security Council also declined to comment.\n\nIt took more than a year to get here. President Joe Biden dropped his opposition to sending F-16s to Ukraine in May 2023, after repeated pleas by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Nato allies to allow their transfer.\n\nThat came alongside intense debate as to whether F-16s would give Ukraine any decisive advantage. Veteran pilots told Bloomberg last May that the jets wouldn't be the game changer Ukraine claims.\n\nThe move has been bedevilled by delays, questions around spare parts, and a language barrier between Ukrainian pilots and their foreign trainers. Planners have also worried that the country doesn't have enough runways -- and those it does have are vulnerable to Russian attacks.\n\nSo far, Ukrainian pilots have trained with F-16s abroad including in the US. In the meantime, the battlefield has changed, with both sides increasingly relying on cheap drones and Russia bolstering its air defenses.\n\nDenmark and the Netherlands are supplying the planes, with Belgium and Norway also pledging jets. Jake Sullivan, Biden's top national security adviser, has said the F-16s are expected to defend front-line forces in the short term and help retake territory \"down the road.\"", "source": {"uri": "luxtimes.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Luxembourg Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/qtqp8b-f16-denmark.jpg/alternates/BASE_SIXTEEN_NINE/F16%20denmark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

According to the magazine, Kiev may count on receiving 79 F-16 jets, with the West continuing to transfer them to Ukraine throughout 2025.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that the deliveries of new weapons and equipment, including F-16s, to Ukraine would not reverse the situation on the frontlines, but will result in the protraction of the conflict.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 98, "textEnd": 106}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

According to The Economist, these initial deliveries come a year after President Volodymyr Zelensky's persistent appeals and the eventual approval from the Biden administration, following pressure from European allies.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine is expected to receive an additional 20 aircraft. The remaining F-16s, promised by the F-16 coalition led by Denmark and the Netherlands, will be delivered in batches throughout 2025. However, the gradual increase in aircraft numbers means it may take some time before the F-16s have a substantial impact on the battlefield.\n\nA report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) highlights that Ukraine requires significantly more aircraft than currently promised to achieve air superiority and support ground offensives. The report suggests that Ukraine needs at least 12 squadrons of 18 aircraft each, while the promised number would only suffice for two or three squadrons.\n\nThe arrival of the F-16s is seen as the beginning of Ukraine's efforts to build its Air Force to NATO standards, connecting it to a well-established F-16 supply chain. These advanced aircraft will enable Ukraine to utilize NATO weapon systems, such as Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles, more effectively than with their existing MiG or Su fighters.\n\nOn July 31, Bloomberg reported that Ukraine received its first batch of F-16 fighter jets, which was later confirmed by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. The Times specified that the initial six jets were delivered from the Netherlands, with additional aircraft expected from Denmark soon.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that Ukrainian pilots have already conducted their first combat flights with the new F-16s, using them as supplementary air defense assets to protect against Russian strikes.

Russia's air defense systems would make it too risky for Ukraine to try to use the jets to support its troop movements on the front line, analysts cited by the outlet acknowledged.The fact that Kiev's pilots only got a nine-month training \"crash course\" on using the F-16s as compared to the typical three-year course Western pilots receive was also noted. Ukraine recently received a handful of F-16s from the Netherlands. Denmark, Belgium, and Norway have promised to provide the Kiev regime with more over the next few months.

He warned that if these fighter jets are deployed from the territory of third countries, they will be considered legitimate targets for Russian forces.

These jets can offer air cover for troops, strike ground targets, engage enemy aircraft, and intercept missiles.\n\n\"It's finally a reality. F-16s in Ukraine, in our skies,\" said Zelensky during a ceremony at an undisclosed location, as reported by CNN.\n\n\"We held hundreds of meetings and negotiations to strengthen the capabilities of our aviation and air defense,\" Zelensky added.\n\nIn August 2023, US President Joe Biden approved the deployment of used F-16s to Ukraine, though the US will not be supplying its own aircraft. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway have pledged to provide Ukraine with over 60 F-16s in the coming months, which may result in a gradual delivery process.\n\nWhat Contributions Can F-16s Make To Ukraine's War Effort?\n\nAccording to Federico Borsari from the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington, F-16s will likely have three primary roles.\n\nThey will intercept Russian missiles and drones that have been relentlessly attacking Ukraine, suppress enemy air defence systems, and target Russian troop positions and ammunition depots with air-to-ground missiles.\n\nThe F-16s might be equipped with UK-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles, which have a range exceeding 250 kilometres and could hit targets inside Russia.

One reason for the delay in providing sufficient numbers of F-16s to make an impact, he says, is a \"pitiful\" lack of training slots for Ukrainian pilots-a \"policy decision by the administration.\" Language difficulties have also contributed.

The move was complicated by delays, questions about spare parts, and a language barrier between the Ukrainian pilots and their foreign instructors. Planners are also concerned that the country does not have enough airstrips and that those that do exist are vulnerable to Russian attacks.\n\nThe New York Times wrote that due to the limited number of trained personnel, Ukraine will be able to deploy only approximately 10 F-16 aircraft this year.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba recently said that the promise of the F-16 appearing in Ukrainian skies in the summer of 2024 \"has already been fulfilled\", although there was no official confirmation of the arrival at that time.\n\nBack in May 2023, US President Joe Biden approved plans to train Ukrainian pilots on American F-16 fighter jets. Subsequently, the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium announced that they would hand over aircraft to Ukraine, in particular for exercises to be held in Denmark and Romania.\n\nThe rest of the countries have confirmed their readiness to participate in the training of Ukrainian pilots for the F-16.\n\nIn November, the F-16 fighter pilot training center was inaugurated in the Romanian city of Fete\u0219ti, where Ukrainian pilots were to be trained, in particular. Among the instructors at this base can be not only representatives of Romania, the Netherlands, and the USA, but also military pilots from other NATO member states.\n\nThe first group of Ukrainian pilots graduated in the US in May, while Denmark trained 50 Ukrainian F-16 maintenance specialists.", "source": {"uri": "hromadske.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "hromadske.ua"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Kuleba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dmytro Kuleba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fete\u0219ti", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fete\u0219ti"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fete\u0219ti"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://hromadske.ua/static/content/thumbs/1200x630/7/3e/oiwxbj---c1200x630x50px50p--03f4a5f134964e9ac8c20ce20d3d13e7.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Ukraine's pilots are described as excellent and battle-hardened, however even these relatively old F-16s are significantly different and more sophisticated than the Soviet-era MiG-29s and Sukhoi-27s they are accustomed to.\n\nAccording to Nico Lange, a former chief of staff in Germany's Defence Ministry, the Russians view the supplied aircraft as a priority target. This is why they have been deployed with utmost secrecy in dispersed sites with subterranean or hardened shelters, as well as decoys.\n\nJournalists feel that because the number of fighters is slowly expanding, it may take some time for the F-16 to make a big difference.\n\nIt will take time to integrate the F-16 into Ukraine's air defence systems and develop operational experience. General Hodges believes that coordinating aircraft flights from multiple airfields will be a hard undertaking.\n\nQuote: \"Still, the F-16s' arrival marks the start of building a NATO-standard air force. It plugs Ukraine into the F-16's well-developed supply chain. NATO weapons systems such as Storm Shadow/Scalp missiles will be far more effective when carried by a plane they were designed for, rather than lashed on to elderly MiGs and Sukhois. Ukraine's F-16s also come equipped with Link-16, a NATO tactical data-link that allows secure communications and improved situational awareness.\n\nToo few and too late though they may be, the F-16s' importance should not be underestimated.\"", "source": {"uri": "pravda.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-29", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikoyan MiG-29"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Aircraft_Corporation_MiG", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_16", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Link 16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Shadow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm Shadow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data link"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://img.pravda.com/images/doc/7/4/7468896_fb_image_eng_2024_08_04_16_06_44.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784956", "eventUri": "eng-9784956", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 68, "textEnd": 75}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The number of jets was small, they said.\n\nIt's not clear whether Ukrainian pilots, who have trained with their Western allies over the past months, will be able to immediately use the warplanes or the process will take longer, the people said.\n\nEven if small at first, the transfer of jets should over time help Kyiv build the capacity to put a dent in Russia's aerial superiority, which has allowed the Kremlin to decimate the country's power infrastructure, leading to rolling blackouts.\n\nA spokesperson for Ukraine's defence ministry, Diana Davityan, declined to comment.\n\nIt took more than a year to get here. President Joe Biden dropped his opposition to sending F-16s to Ukraine in May 2023, after repeated pleas by President Volodymyr Zelensky and Nato allies to allow their transfer.\n\nThat came alongside intense debate as to whether F-16s would give Ukraine any decisive advantage. Veteran pilots told Bloomberg last May that the jets wouldn't be the game-changer Ukraine claims.\n\nThe move has been bedevilled by delays, questions around spare parts and a language barrier between Ukrainian pilots and their foreign trainers. Planners have also worried that the country doesn't have enough runways -- and those it does have are vulnerable to Russian attacks.\n\nSo far, Ukrainian pilots have trained with F-16s abroad including in the US. In the meantime, the battlefield has changed, with both sides increasingly relying on cheap drones and Russia bolstering its air defences.\n\nDenmark and the Netherlands are supplying the planes, with Belgium and Norway also pledging jets. Jake Sullivan, Biden's top national security adviser, has said the F-16s are expected to defend frontline forces in the short term and help retake territory \"down the road\".\n\nUkraine's capital was the target of the most extensive Russian drone attack so far this year, lasting nearly the whole night, the municipal military administration said.\n\nAir defence intercepted all 89 Shahed drones, which were launched overnight in two waves and directed mainly at the Kyiv region, Ukrainian Air Force Chief Commander Mykola Oleshchuk said on Telegram.\n\nThe barrage caused no damage in Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko and the military administration said on Telegram. In the Kyiv region, debris from intercepted drones caused damage to 13 private homes, the head of the regional military administration Ruslan Kravchenko said in a Telegram post. Most of the debris fell on the ground outside residential areas.\n\nUkraine has suffered rolling blackouts since April after the Kremlin started another intense round of missile and drone attacks targeting the power infrastructure, starting around the New Year holiday.\n\nThe government says that the electricity shortages it expects in the coming winter will be manageable unless more damage is caused by further Russian attacks.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin ordered officials to double a bonus for people willing to join Russia's war in Ukraine, offering fresh evidence that the military was struggling to meet recruitment targets.\n\nNew recruits to the army will receive a one-time payment of 400,000 roubles (around $4,600) until the end of the year, according to a presidential order published on Wednesday. Putin also called on regional authorities to match the federal government payment, which was previously set at 195,000 roubles.\n\nRead more: Moscow offers record $22,000 for Russians to fight in Ukraine\n\nRussia's military has incurred huge casualties since Putin ordered the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with Western estimates putting the numbers killed or wounded at as high as 500,000. An accelerating pay race among Russia's regions to persuade people to join up has added to labour shortages in the overheating economy, prompting businesses to hike salaries to compete.\n\nIndonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto, who last year unsuccessfully pushed a peace proposal that would have left Russia occupying parts of Ukraine, pledged to deepen ties at talks with Putin in Moscow.\n\n\"We consider Russia as a real friend,\" Prabowo, a former general who is currently defence minister, said on Wednesday in televised remarks. \"I would like to continue to maintain and enhance\" the close relationship between the two countries, he said.\n\nThe visit is the latest sign of Putin's success in countering the isolation that the US and its allies have sought to impose in response to Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Moscow earlier this month to meet with Putin, who has courted so-called Global South nations as a counterweight to the US-led world order.\n\nRead more: Putin is meeting a lot of world leaders for a global 'outcast'\n\nPrabowo also met with Russian Defence Minister Andrey Belousov. The visit was intended to \"strengthen bilateral relations between Indonesia and Russia and enhance cooperation, especially in the defence sector\", said the defence ministry in Jakarta.\n\nBoth Putin and Prabowo noted historically close ties since the Soviet Union built up relations with the Southeast Asian country early in the Cold War, though Indonesia later tilted to the US. \"Indonesia and Russia have had friendly relations for decades,\" said Putin.\n\nChina has adjusted its export controls on drones intended for military use, as Beijing faces growing criticism from the US and its allies over bolstering Russia's battlefield efforts in Ukraine.\n\nDrones with high-precision measurement equipment were added to a blacklist by a range of agencies including the Central Military Commission on Wednesday. The changes modify a list published last year and will take effect from 1 September.\n\nWhile officials removed export bans on consumer-grade drones, the Ministry of Commerce reiterated its stance that civilian equipment should not be used for the \"proliferation of mass destruction weapons, terrorism or military purposes\".\n\nRead more: China seizes chance to play peacemaker in Ukraine before US vote\n\nPresident Xi Jinping's government rolled out the directive days after Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba visited China for the first time since Russia invaded his nation in 2022. Beijing has repeatedly pushed back against criticisms from the West that it is sending Moscow dual-use items that have military applications.

These close-up shots were posted by the Socialnoe-Pobutovii Zhurnal Vodogray [Social and Household Magazine \"Vodogray\" or SPJV] on their Telegram account. While we cannot independently verify SPJV's claims, the photos are noteworthy.\n\nThe initial image captures the F-16 MLU speeding down the runway, showcasing an AIM-9 missile attached to its wing and the Ukrainian coat of arms prominently displayed on its tail. Another photo highlights the vibrant colors of Ukraine on one of the fighter's wings. The subsequent images become even more intriguing, revealing an AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air [AMRAAM] missile.\n\nSPJV suggests that the aircraft close-up, along with another one seen in the distance, originally belonged to the Royal Danish Air Force. This assertion is based on the presence of the Pylon Integrated Dispensing System Plus [PIDS+] and Electronic Combat Integrated Pylon System Plus [ECIPS+] from Israel's Elbit Systems -- upgrades typical of former Danish F-16s.\n\nAnother photo captures the pilot ready for takeoff, his right hand raised in a salute. Unfortunately, the picture's quality doesn't allow for a detailed view of his uniform and its markings. The timing of these photos remains a mystery, as does whether they feature aircraft already deployed in Ukraine or were taken beforehand.\n\nF-16s in Ukraine\n\nOn July 31, BulgarianMilitary.com reported the arrival of the first F-16 fighters for the Ukrainian Air Force on Ukrainian soil. Just a day before, U.S. media disclosed that, according to military sources, the U.S. is already sending missiles for these Ukrainian F-16s. Washington and its European allies had committed to delivering combat aircraft to Ukraine, promising Kyiv the first F-16s in the latter half of 2024.\n\nExpect reports soon of Ukrainian pilots deploying F-16s against Russian military targets. The current locations of these F-16s in Ukraine remain undisclosed. According to Ukrainian military officials, their initial use will likely be limited due to Moscow's dense anti-aircraft network along the entire Ukrainian front.\n\nThe exact number of F-16s currently in Ukraine is still unknown. BulgarianMilitary.com's analysis suggests there may be three F-16 fighters, based on the fact that only six pilots have completed training in Europe. The number of pilots trained in the U.S. remains unspecified.\n\nAbout F-16 MLU\n\nThe F-16 Mid-Life Update [MLU] is a comprehensive upgrade program designed to extend the operational life and enhance the capabilities of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, a multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General Dynamics [now Lockheed Martin]. The MLU program includes significant improvements in avionics, radar systems, and overall performance, making the aircraft more effective in modern combat scenarios.\n\nThe dimensions of the F-16 MLU are consistent with the original F-16 design. The aircraft has a length of approximately 49.3 feet [15 meters], a wingspan of 32.8 feet [10 meters], and a height of 16.7 feet [5.1 meters]. These dimensions contribute to its agility and versatility in various combat roles.\n\nThe propulsion system of the F-16 MLU typically includes a single Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220/229 or General Electric F110-GE-100/129 after-burning turbofan engine. These engines provide the aircraft with a maximum speed of over Mach 2 and a thrust-to-weight ratio that supports superior maneuverability and acceleration.\n\nSensors\n\nThe F-16 MLU is equipped with advanced control systems, including digital flight control systems [DFCS] and fly-by-wire technology. These systems enhance the aircraft's stability, responsiveness, and overall handling characteristics, allowing for precise control during complex maneuvers.\n\nThe sensor suite on the F-16 MLU includes a variety of advanced systems such as the AN/APG-66[V]2 or AN/APG-68[V]9 radar, targeting pods like the LANTIRN [Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night], and electronic warfare systems. These sensors provide the pilot with enhanced situational awareness and targeting capabilities.\n\nThe avionics package of the F-16 MLU has been significantly upgraded to include modern displays, mission computers, and data link systems. These enhancements improve the pilot's ability to process information and make real-time decisions during missions. The cockpit features multifunction displays [MFDs], a digital terrain system, and a helmet-mounted cueing system [HMCS].\n\nRadars\n\nThe radar systems on the F-16 MLU are among its most critical upgrades. The aircraft is typically equipped with the AN/APG-66(V]2 or AN/APG-68[V]9 radar, which offers improved range, resolution, and reliability. These radars support air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, providing the pilot with detailed target information and tracking capabilities.\n\nThe operational range of the F-16 MLU varies depending on the mission profile and external fuel tanks. With standard internal fuel, the aircraft has a combat radius of approximately 340 miles [550 kilometers]. This range can be extended with the use of external fuel tanks and aerial refueling, allowing for longer missions and greater operational flexibility.\n\nSeveral countries continue to operate the F-16 MLU, benefiting from its enhanced capabilities. Notable operators include Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Turkey. These nations have invested in the MLU program to maintain the relevance and effectiveness of their F-16 fleets in modern combat environments.", "source": {"uri": "bulgarianmilitary.com", "dataType":

After all, the country does not have trained pilots, the necessary infrastructure, and the means to effectively protect Western aircraft.\n\nThis was pointed out by Defense Express editor-in-chief Oleh Katkov on Radio NV. He noted that the Americans cannot provide additional fighter jets because they themselves are experiencing a shortage of combat aircraft (due to years of army downsizing).\n\n\"Now the US has a critical shortage of aircraft. The Congress is against decommissioning them. And what they are decommissioning is already junk that can not be called a weapon,\" the source assured.\n\nHe also emphasized that 128 aircraft require at least as many pilots, and there is nowhere to get them. Training a pilot requires many months of study. The expert cited the example of the newly created Romanian F-16 Pilot Training Center, which graduated only seven pilots in eight months of training.\n\nAccording to him, even if the problem is solved by attracting foreign volunteer pilots to fly the fighters, \"this does not solve the problem,\" as the Russian occupation forces will certainly try to destroy on the ground.\n\n\"All 128 units physically cannot fit on one airfield. Usually, only 12 planes can be stationed at one. Thus, it is necessary to have 10 prepared airfields for these aircraft to be based in Ukraine and fly daily. Does Ukraine has 10 airfields with a hard, full-fledged surface for F-16s, with the appropriate number of arched shelters, and where they won't break their landing gear quickly enough? This is an open question. Probably not,\" Katkov said.\n\nAnother problem, he said, is the protection of airfields. For example, to protect them from Russian missile attacks, at least 20 batteries of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems (at least two for each) are needed, not to mention shorter-range air defense systems.\n\n\"The urgent need for these 128 fighters is explained by the enemy's active aircraft (up to 300 units every day)... Is it possible for Ukraine to have 128 F-16 fighters even theoretically? Yes. Is it possible to get pilots? Yes. Is it possible to deploy the aircraft so that they are not destroyed on the first day? Not even in theory,\" Katkov summarized.\n\nOn July 31, it was reported that Ukraine had allegedly already received the first batch of F-16 fighters. The Office of the President and the White House made it clear that they would not officially confirm this information. However, British Defense Secretary Grant Shepps reacted to the alleged appearance of modern fighters in Ukraine, saying that this event marks a turning point in the fight of the Defense Forces against the Russian army and its Su-35 aircraft.\n\nAt the same time, Russian propagandists have already threatened to reconnoiter Ukrainian airfields and destroy Western aircraft. The occupiers have even deployed Buk SAM in Donetsk region to hunt for F-16s.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multirole_combat_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multirole combat aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_occupation_of_Kherson_Oblast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian occupation of Kherson Oblast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_gear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landing gear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_missile_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buk missile system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-35", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sukhoi Su-35"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Ground_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Ground Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

S-400s Gear-Up To Hunt Ukraine's F-16s But MANPADS Could Steal The Show", "body": "F-16s, Ukraine's most wished-for weapon, have touched down in the country. This has paved the way for the most awaited showdown between the American fighter and the Russian air defense system S-400 (NATO code-named SA-21 'Growler').\n\nConsidering the S-400s' lukewarm success in the protracted war, it remains to be seen if the Igla MANPADS (Man-portable air defense system) will prove to be a more effective weapon against the F-16s.\n\nThe S-400 'Tirumf' is Russia's most advanced air defense system. It first became operational in 2007 and was developed to rival the US Patriot System.\n\nRussia has claimed it to be the \"best long-range air defense system in the world.\" While the Patriots cost US $1 billion, the S-400 is much lower.\n\nThe ongoing Russian invasion has yielded mixed results regarding the efficacy of S-400s. In November 2023, the UK Ministry of Defense said that Ukraine had likely annihilated four Russian air-defense systems in a week, with three of them being S-400s. They were destroyed in the Luhansk region on October 26, 2023.\n\nIn June this year, again, Ukraine's General Staff claimed that it destroyed another S-400 and another S-300 in Crimea.\n\nThe S-400s are designed to shoot down aircraft and missiles at long ranges. Russia has deployed the system extensively along the frontline. They have a range of 400 kilometers and can detect targets up to 1,000 kilometers away. It includes truck-mounted radars, a mobile command post, and multiple missile launch platforms.\n\nRecognizing the threat, Ukraine knocked down many of these systems before the fighter jets arrived. It remains to be seen how effective the Danish F-16s will be against Russian air defense.\n\nMoscow has threatened to hunt the jets even before they take off with its missiles. Once they get airborne, the F-16s will be up against the feared S-400s, which can take on multiple aircraft at once.\n\nRussia made good on its threat in early July as it launched missile attacks and destroyed at least five Ukrainian combat aircraft, out of which at least two were Su-27s, and one was the MiG-29. At least three airfields have been attacked in July alone: one in the southern Odesa region and two in central Ukraine, Myrhorod and Kryvyi Rih.\n\nConsidering the Russian air defense threat, much information about the F-16 deployment and the weapons they will wield is classified. There have been speculations that the F-16 could carry the UK-supplied Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 250 kilometers and the potential to strike targets inside Russia.\n\nThey might also be equipped with long-range air-to-air missiles that can pose a considerable threat to Russian bombers and fighter jets.\n\nThe S-400s have a blind spot too. The longer-range interceptors used by S-400 (48N6E2/3, 40N6E) are all semi-active radar homing. As long as the aircraft fly below the radar horizon, they are safe from being lit up by the radar. The S-400s have also faced challenges from the high speed and maneuverability of ballistic missiles.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, Russia managed to take out 33 percent of the Ukrainian fighter jets using the 'deadly combo' of Igla and Verba Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS).\n\nThe F-16s are certainly superior to Ukraine's older jets. With their more powerful radars and better resistance to jamming, the F-16s will be able to detect Russian aircraft at longer distances and allow them to remain outside the range of the Russian air defense systems.\n\nIn the event of suddenly appearing air targets at low and extremely low altitudes, the Igla and Verba MANPADS have proven themselves well, which account for a third of the destroyed manned aircraft of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In case the F-16s fly low they can be susceptible to the Russian MANPADS.\n\n\"Igla will always be a deadly weapon. They cannot be jammed, and it is difficult to deceive a human being manning a MANPAD through decoy,\" a former Indian Air Force (IAF) told the EurAsian Times.\n\nThe Igla-S and Verba MANPADS can take down low-flying fixed -- and rotary-winged aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cruise missiles flying at a range of 500 to 6000 meters and an altitude of 10 to 3500 kilometers.\n\nMANPADS have been an important part of Russia's air-denial strategy, taking down the greatest number of Ukrainian fighter jets. Ukraine has also employed the Soviet-era Igla-S to deny air superiority to the Russian Air Force.\n\nMultiple experts quoted by the EurAsian Times have stated that Ukraine will predominantly use F-16s in its air defense role to destroy cruise missiles and drones. However, if Kyiv decides to go on the offensive with Fighting Falcons, S-400 MANPADS and RuAF jets could pose a challenge.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latest

The US also pledged $500 million in military aid to bolster Manila's security forces, including the Coast Guard.\n\nAt the back of this security arrangement, an unknown source told Reuters that \"there is a possibility that next year there might be an additional budget for the air force,\" adding that the Philippines' Defense Department may be poised to purchase the latest F-16 fighter jets.\n\nThe development comes days after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. gave the green light for the Philippines to acquire new multirole fighter jets, marking a key step forward in the country's military modernization efforts. AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. made the announcement on July 4 during a briefing with the Defense Press Corps.\n\nF-16s \"Sitting Ducks\" For Russian MiG-31 Fighters? Putin Warns Of Consequences Over Fighting Falcons\n\nChina has seized on this development, criticizing the military cooperation between Manila and Washington. Citing Chinese military analysts, a report published in the Chinese state-owned publication Global Times questioned whether the US and the Philippines had the financial resources to produce enough F-16s. More importantly, the report noted that \"the F-16 also poses little threat to Chinese stealth fighter jets\".\n\nThe above assertion is significant as the self-ruled state of Taiwan is also currently acquiring its F-16 Vipers, with several units already operational with the Republic of China Air Force (RoCAF). Taiwan is upgrading 139 older variants of the F-16 fighter jet to the Block 70/72 Viper configuration. It is also acquiring 66 new F-16 Block 70/72 Viper fighter jets to bolster its combat fleet.\n\n'Raptor Salad' For Lunch! US F-22 Raptor Outgunned, Outmaneuvered By German Eurofighter Typhoon?\n\nIn response to this fleet upgrade, Chinese military analysts have continued to push the same narrative: the PLA Air Force J-20 stealth fighters will have a clear combat advantage against the F-16 Block 70 Viper fighter jets. Even so, it continues to watch and oppose its opponents in the region, acquiring the latest variant of the F-16s.\n\nAmid escalating tensions between China and its two rivals -- the Philippines in the South China Sea and Taiwan in the East China Sea -- Manila's acquisition of F-16 Block 70 Vipers would hold considerable significance and symbolism.\n\nIn addition, the US has been aggressively marketing its new F-16 variant to states in the Indo-Pacific. The United States, for instance, is also pushing the sale of its F-16 Vipers to Thailand with an added incentive to make a potential deal \"sweeter.\"\n\nSix B-52 Bombers 'Shot Down' In One Night: How Russian AD Missiles Wreaked Havoc On Stratofortress During Vietnam War\n\nThe United States has already supplied hundreds of fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets to its regional partners, such as Japan and South Korea, which has displeased China.\n\nIt appears that the US is now employing the newest F-16s as a means of leverage against China. This is especially remarkable given that, even as a fourth-generation aircraft, the F-16 continues to attract considerable media attention.\n\nAfter a long wait, Ukraine recently received the first batch of its F-16 Fighting Falcons, which will be equipped with deadly US missiles, including the AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile) and AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles to combat the massive threat presented by Russia. While Russia does not consider them a threat per se, Ukraine's air fleet, currently dominated by archaic Soviet-era warplanes, will be augmented by the addition of these Fighting Falcons.\n\nMiG-31 Foxhound: Why Russia's 'Super Interceptor', That Can Shoot Satellites, Fire Hypersonic Missiles, Found No Buyers?\n\nIt is safe to say that these US-origin fighters have become an irritant for both US adversaries -- China and Russia. However, the F-16s provided to the Chinese adversaries are brand-new and way more advanced than the older variants provided to Ukraine after being decommissioned from the air forces of NATO states, including Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium.\n\nUkraine is due to receive the older variants of F-16 fighter jets modified by the respective countries over the years to increase their service life and add more teeth to their power. Military experts have emphasized that despite the technical upgrades, these systems are second-hand warplanes at the end of their life cycles.\n\nThe newer Block 70/72 F-16 has built on the capabilities of the F-16, popular for its combat performance in an array of battlefields. The F-16 Block 70/72, also called the F-16V, is an upgraded variant of the well-known F-16 multirole fighter. This Lockheed Martin version incorporates modern features and technological advancements while continuing to serve as a versatile and efficient fighter aircraft.\n\nOperated by the U.S. Air Force and other countries, the Falcon has been a mainstay in international conflicts since its introduction in 1978. Significant upgrades are included in Lockheed Martin's most recent version, the Block 70/72, such as a longer service life of 12,000 hours, conformal fuel tanks for greater range, the cutting-edge APG-83 AESA radar for better targeting, the Legion IRST pod for passive target detection, and Auto GCAS (Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System) to avoid ground collisions.\n\nDespite maintaining its status as a fourth-generation fighter, the upgraded F-16V boasts a range of advanced capabilities due to its enhanced avionics suite. The core of this suite is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR), equipped with an active electronically scanned array (AESA).\n\nThis state-of-the-art radar system enhances detection and engagement ranges, improves target-spotting capabilities for low-signature objects such as cruise missiles, and enhances resistance to electronic countermeasures.\n\nApart from the APG 83 radar, these F-16s are equipped with a fully functional Legion IRST targeting pod out of the factory. Comparable to the sensors of the F-35, the Legion pod tracks and detects targets using infrared rather than radar signals. Since the technology is \"passive\", meaning the jet doesn't emit any energy, this can be a big benefit. An airplane emits a lot of energy when it utilizes its radar equipment, which is detectable by enemies. By steering clear of that threat, IRST sensors allow their host aircraft to remain concealed for an extended period.\n\nThe F-16 was originally intended to be a lightweight daylight fighter to support the F-15 Eagle of the US Air Force. However, it has undergone substantial development to become an all-weather multirole aircraft.\n\nAccording to Lockheed Martin, the F-16 is expected to last 1.5 times longer than earlier models -- 12,000 more hours -- so it should continue to be in use well into the 2060s. If so, with more than nine decades of service, it will rank among the combat aircraft with the longest service history.\n\nIn addition to its enhanced durability and resilience, the Block 70/72 features fuselage-mounted conformal fuel tanks that set it apart. These tanks increase fuel range and capacity, presenting a challenging balance since additional fuel usually means increased drag.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A number of pro-Kremlin English-language accounts on the social media platform X, Telegram channels in English and Spanish, as well as a Bulgarian media outlet, have spread reports that out of 50 Ukrainian pilots who allegedly have already received training at the European Training Center to operate F-16 fighters in Romania, only three are ready to make independent flights.\n\nThe reason for this seems to be the reluctance of Ukrainians to learn English, as well as their low physical fitness and alcohol consumption. As \"proof,\" the authors of the fake made public a report allegedly prepared by the Romanian Defense Ministry. The Kremlin's propaganda resources then began to reproduce this information in Russian.\n\nThis is a fake. Such a report did not appear on the official website of the Romanian Defense Ministry. In addition, Ukrainian pilots have not even started training at the Romanian training center. It emerged that at the end of July, the first group of pilots did graduate from the center, but they are Romanian specialists, not Ukrainian ones.\n\nIn his statement regarding the training of the first group of pilots, the Minister of Defense of the Netherlands [the Ministry of Defense provided F-16 fighter jets for the center] Ruben Brekelmans emphasized that the next group of Romanian pilots has already started training, and later Ukrainians will also train at the center. In general, such training lasts about eight months.\n\nLater, the fake about improper training of Ukrainian pilots was refuted on the Inforadar platform of the Romanian Defense Ministry. It turned out that the fake was created on the basis of a report on the activities of the Romanian Defense Ministry in 2023. In addition, it contains grammatical errors and has an incorrect design. In addition, it is stated that Ukrainian pilots have not yet started training at the Romanian center.\n\nThrough such fakes and statements by propagandists, particularly Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, the Russians are trying to downplay the role of Western weapons and impose the public opinion that the F-16 fighters do not threaten the Russian army and will not affect the situation on the battlefield. Similar disinformation campaigns were carried out by Russia amid the transfer to Ukraine of other equipment and weapons from the allies, which later showed good results at the front.\n\nUkrinform reported earlier that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington in July that Denmark and the Netherlands had begun transferring F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine and that this summer they will help Ukraine defend against Russian aggression.\n\nBloomberg, citing its sources, wrote on July 31 that the first batch of F-16 fighter jets had arrived in Ukraine.\n\nUkrinform earlier refuted a fake from a Spanish blogger about the death of soldiers from NATO countries in Odesa.", "source": {"uri": "ukrinform.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

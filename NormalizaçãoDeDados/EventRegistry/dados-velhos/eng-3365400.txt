Both acquisitions were met with skepticism from investors, who now view the two companies very differently.\n\nSince Geely's $1.5 billion purchase of Sweden's Volvo Cars in 2010, the Chinese automaker has seen the share price of its listed unit increase sixfold in Hong Kong trading. India's Tata Motors, which bought Britain's Jaguar Land Rover two years earlier for $2.5 billion, has merely doubled in the same period. The contrast is even starker if one shortens the timeframe: Tata is down about 21 percent this year, while Geely is up 149 percent.\n\nThe difference, says Jochen Siebert, a Singapore-based automotive consultant, lies in what the companies have done with their landmark purchases. Under Chairman Li Shufu, Volvo Cars was able to lower its costs and gain economies of scale by manufacturing and selling in China, the world's largest auto market. Geely in return benefited from the technology of the more established Swedish automaker through the development of common underpinnings, which Volvo Cars also uses for its smaller models.\n\nWhen Tata Motors wanted a partner to help it break out of the domestic India market, it looked not to its luxury division, but to Volkswagen AG's Skoda. JLR and its Indian parent were just \"too far from each other\" in positioning, preventing them from creating any synergies between them, said Siebert. Talks about a partnership between Skoda and Tata ended last week without a deal as the projected cost savings fell short of expectations, leaving the latter without a global partner.\n\n\"Tata sees JLR as a standalone and a financial shareholding,\" said Siebert, managing director of JSC Automotive Consulting. \"As long as Tata doesn't want to develop into a higher-positioned brand in its own right, there is just no way to cooperate with JLR.\"\n\nTata didn't immediately offer a comment on the market perception of its acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover. A spokesman for Zhejiang Geely Holding said in a message sent by WeChat that the success of the acquisition \"has been down to Volvo's strong product range and customer-centric design and engineering ethos.\"\n\nTata is now almost entirely dependent on its luxury unit for profits. Jaguar Land Rover accounted for 78 percent of the group's total revenue and 96 percent of its operating income. Sales of Tata's own namesake brand of vehicles contributed 1.3 percent to operating profit, behind that of construction equipment.\n\nThis has made the parent vulnerable to any hiccups at the British unit. When JLR said it expects pressure on profit margins to continue due to higher incentive levels, investors sent Tata's stock down 8.6 percent to a 15-month low on Aug. 10. Deliveries at JLR grew at a slower 4 percent pace in the April-to-June quarter because of weak demand including for Land Rover's Discovery Sport and Range Rover Sport SUVs.\n\nJLR also counts China as a major market and Tata can do little to help in the world's biggest auto market given its lack of presence there, said Bill Russo, managing director of Gao Feng Advisory Co.\n\nSee here for more on Volvo-Geely collaboration.\n\nBy contrast, Volvo Cars was the first Western carmaker to export a premium China-made car to the U.S. in 2015 with the S60 Inscription. The company last year began building high-end versions of its S90 premium sedan in Daqing, China for global exports and plans to assemble vehicles in India this year, starting with the XC90 SUV. Geely and Volvo Cars also worked together to develop a compact-car platform that will be used by Geely's upscale Lynk & Co. brand.\n\nGeely's investments in factories and in-house technologies have resulted in a series of new car models, a spokeswoman for Volvo Cars said in an email response. The transformation continues with two new joint ventures formed between Volvo and Geely this month, she said.\n\nGeely has thrown a lot of money at Volvo without concern for an immediate return, a luxury available to an unlisted company, says Janet Lewis, an auto analyst in Hong Kong with Macquarie Group Ltd. This has enabled the Swedish company to invest in technology, whereas it was relatively starved of development money under Ford ownership, she said.\n\n\"The longer-term challenge for Volvo is its tiny scale. Even combined with Geely for volume, it is going to have a hard time meeting the increasing technology needs when it is up against well-funded giants like Toyota, VW, Renault-Nissan-MMC and GM,\" said Lewis. \"JLR faces similar challenges with its small scale and its main hope is that Tata ties up with a global partner in India.\"", "id": "8989295", "details": {"gpCnt": 3, "liCnt": 173}, "date":

A spokesman for Zhejiang Geely Holding said in a message sent by WeChat that the success of the acquisition \"has been down to Volvo's strong product range and customer-centric design and engineering ethos.\"\n\nTata is now almost entirely dependent on its luxury unit for profits. Jaguar Land Rover accounted for 78% of the group's total revenue and 96% of its operating income. Sales of Tata's own namesake brand of vehicles contributed 1.3% to operating profit, behind that of construction equipment.\n\nThis has made the parent vulnerable to any hiccups at the British unit. When JLR said it expects pressure on profit margins to continue due to higher incentive levels, investors sent Tata's stock down 8.6% to a 15-month low on 10 August. Deliveries at JLR grew at a slower 4% pace in the April-to-June quarter because of weak demand including for Land Rover's Discovery Sport and Range Rover Sport SUVs.\n\nJLR also counts China as a major market and Tata can do little to help in the world's biggest auto market given its lack of presence there, said Bill Russo, managing director of Gao Feng Advisory Co.\n\nBy contrast, Volvo Cars was the first Western carmaker to export a premium China-made car to the US in 2015 with the S60 Inscription. The company last year began building high-end versions of its S90 premium sedan in Daqing, China for global exports and plans to assemble vehicles in India this year, starting with the XC90 SUV. Geely and Volvo Cars also worked together to develop a compact-car platform that will be used by Geely's upscale Lynk & Co. brand.\n\nGeely's investments in factories and in-house technologies have resulted in a series of new car models, a spokeswoman for Volvo Cars said in an email response. The transformation continues with two new joint ventures formed between Volvo and Geely this month, she said.\n\nGeely has thrown a lot of money at Volvo without concern for an immediate return, a luxury available to an unlisted company, says Janet Lewis, an auto analyst in Hong Kong with Macquarie Group Ltd. This has enabled the Swedish company to invest in technology, whereas it was relatively starved of development money under Ford ownership, she said.\n\n\"The longer-term challenge for Volvo is its tiny scale. Even combined with Geely for volume, it is going to have a hard time meeting the increasing technology needs when it is up against well-funded giants like Toyota, VW, Renault-Nissan-MMC and GM,\" said Lewis. \"JLR faces similar challenges with its small scale and its main hope is that Tata ties up with a global partner in India.\" Bloomberg", "id": "8996567", "details": {"liCnt": 59}, "date":

Both acquisitions were met with scepticism from investors, who now view the two firms very differently.\n\nSince Geely's US$1.5 billion (S$2.04 billion) purchase of Sweden's Volvo Cars in 2010, the Chinese carmaker has seen the share price of its listed unit increase sixfold in Hong Kong trading.\n\nIndia's Tata, which bought Britain's Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) two years earlier for US$2.5 billion, has merely doubled in the same period. The contrast is even starker in a shorter timeframe: Tata is down about 21 per cent this year, while Geely is up 155 per cent.\n\nThe difference, said Singapore-based automotive consultant Jochen Siebert, lies in what the companies have done with their landmark purchases.\n\nGet The Straits Times\n\nnewsletters in your inboxSign Up\n\nUnder chairman Li Shufu, Volvo Cars was able to lower its costs and gain economies of scale by manufacturing and selling in China, the world's largest car market. Geely in return benefited from the technology of the more established Swedish carmaker through the development of common underpinnings, which Volvo Cars also uses for its smaller models.\n\nWhen Tata wanted a partner to help it break out of the domestic India market, it looked not to its luxury division, but to Volkswagen's Skoda. JLR and its Indian parent were just \"too far from each other\" in positioning, preventing them from creating any synergies between them, said Mr Siebert.\n\nTalks about a partnership between Skoda and Tata ended last week without a deal as the projected cost savings fell short of expectations.\n\n\"Tata sees JLR as a standalone and a financial shareholding,\" said Mr Siebert, managing director of JSC Automotive Consulting. \"As long as Tata doesn't want to develop into a higher-positioned brand in its own right, there is just no way to cooperate with JLR.\"\n\nGeely's shares rose 2.8 per cent to HK$18.94 as of 9.54am in Hong Kong trading yesterday. The benchmark Hang Seng Index advanced 0.8 per cent.\n\nA spokesman for Zhejiang Geely said the success of the acquisition \"has been down to Volvo's strong product range and customer-centric design and engineering ethos\".\n\nTata did not immediately offer a comment.

The earnings beat analysts' estimates of 4.0 billion yuan.\n\n\"Geely has emerged as one of the biggest winners among the domestic auto market, as it gradually assimilated Volvo's technologies and designs,\" said Peter Chen, a Shanghai-based engineer with US components maker TRW.\n\n\"All eyes will now be on its ambitions to move up the value chain.\"\n\nVehicle shipments jumped 89 per cent to 530,627 cars in the first half, smashing the national growth of 1.6 per cent.\n\nIn July alone, the Zhejiang-based car manufacturer, controlled by billionaire Li Shufu, reported an 88 per cent jump in sales. The company's indigenous brands, including Boyue and Emgrand, recorded sizzling sales too.\n\nGeely has set an annual sales target of 1 million cars for this year with plans to launch a first sports-utility vehicle (SUV), under its own mid-priced Lynk & Co high-end brand, which has been 50/50 jointly developed with Volvo.\n\nVolvo's owner Geely aims to sell 500,000 units of its new Lynk brand vehicles by 2019\n\nGeely Auto's shares have soared 157 per cent so far this year, and rose another 1.2 per cent in early afternoon trading to HK$19.22.\n\nMorgan Stanley has forecast more modest 22 per cent annual sales rise through to 2019.\n\nGeely's multi-brand strategy had previously sparked uncertainty, but working closely in tandem with Volvo has proved a winning formula, backed up by a widespread dealership network, Morgan Stanley said, adding it believes the timing of Geely's initiatives to tap into the mid- to high-end SUV segment perfectly matches the fast growth of segment, which expected to last for the next few years.\n\nLynk also plans to sell vehicles in the United States and Europe, after launching in China.\n\nEarlier this month, Geely and Volvo set up a 50-50 joint venture, GV Automobile Technology (Ningbo), to strengthen their tie-up in technology development.\n\nGeely founder Li said the joint venture would further promote even closer ties between the brands on shared vehicle architecture and electrification.\n\nIn June, Geely also acquired 49.9 per cent in Malaysian carmaker Proton, and 51 per cent of iconic British sports car marque, Lotus.",

Then the carmaker was stung in 2014 by a 77 percent drop in the Russian ruble, triggering a 50 percent decline in profit.\n\nGeely executives said Wednesday they'll continue to take a \"more prudent approach\" to export markets. Read: They're not changing course soon. That's a smart move.\n\nAlthough China's auto sales growth has slowed, the market still grew 6.4 percent in July from the year before, compared with a 6 percent drop in the U.S. It's far better in any case to focus on growth initiatives that Geely's home market cares about -- churning out new SUV models faster than its competitors, producing higher-priced models with more bells and whistles, and coming out with electric vehicles.\n\nWhile all the big manufacturers, from General Motors Co. to Volkswagen AG, have exposure to China, they also have issues to deal with elsewhere that have weighed on their shares. And domestic brands are gaining favor in China, where they make up more than 40 percent of annual sales.\n\nIn the first half, the passenger-vehicle market for indigenous brands expanded 4.3 percent from the year before, Geely said, citing data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That Geely increased sales by 89 percent in the period shows how it's eating into competitors' share.\n\nCertainly, investors must pay for the growth. Geely is trading at an EV/Ebitda multiple of 10.1 times, compared with a 6.2 EV/Ebitda for global automakers in a Bloomberg Intelligence index. That's not as crazy as it seems set against the likes of Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., which is trading at an EV/Ebitda multiple of 20.\n\nAlthough Geely's founder and controlling shareholder, Li Shufu, would probably like to think of himself as a global car mogul, his real success has come from exploiting a home court advantage.

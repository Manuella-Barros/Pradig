Read below for their insights on money lessons they wish they had learned. Wealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them. Appreciating the Value of Money \u201cHaving grown up in a wealthy family and now working for my own business, I have unique insights into the financial lessons often missed when money is readily available,\u201d said Ben Hilton, founder and managing director of Switch Jam Digital. \u201cI never felt the need to worry about money as a child, and therefore, I failed to understand its real value. I now wish that someone had inculcated in me an appreciation of the actual work that goes into making money,\u201d he said. \u201cFor instance, why did someone waste hours in the pursuit of a better deal or draw up a stringent budget? If I had known better the value of money, perhaps I would have been more enlightened about money management and spending habits.\u201d Read Next: How Much Does the Average Middle-Class Person Have in Savings? Budgeting Skills and Money Management \u201cI didn\u2019t have to budget because it wasn\u2019t expected or required in my home, and I\u2019m still unaware of how to properly maintain a budget,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cWhen I first left home and lived alone, I struggled to balance my expenses and income.\u201d He noted that making sure a person knows how to set up and maintain a budget is a rather important skill that prevents overspending and helps to uphold and support personal financial stability. Nischay Rawal, CPA, founder and managing partner of NR Tax & Consulting, shared a similar experience. \u201cGrowing up with wealthy parents, I never learned the value of a dollar or what it meant to budget,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney was always there for whatever I needed or wanted. As a result, I didn\u2019t develop key financial skills that most people gain from an early age. \u201cWhen I started my own business, I had no idea how to forecast expenses, set financial goals or manage cash flow,\u201d Rawal explained. \u201cThe first few years were a crash course in Finance 101. I made many mistakes that could have been avoided if I had a better grasp of basic money management.\u201d Investing Wisely \u201cWhile I had the money, I never learned how to invest early. I lost the basis for generating wealth through investment,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cA clear illustration of this is the fact that I was unaware of compound interest when I was 20 years old, a knowledge that could have significantly increased my financial worth.\u201d Learning investment principles and how to build wealth is crucial, according to Hilton. \u201cHow to invest wisely is a critical lesson for long-term financial growth,\u201d he said. Financial Independence \u201cFinancial security during childhood is typically already wealth-dependent,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cI wish somebody had taught me about financial independence very early. For instance, in the early days of my career, it became easy to reach out to family for money and support instead of struggling and fighting to succeed financially independently.\u201d He added that knowing the importance of financial independence teaches a person the value of hard work and personal development. Finding Purpose and Meaning Outside of Money Rawal noted that another key lesson he didn\u2019t learn was to find purpose and meaning outside of money. \u201cMy parents\u2019 wealth afforded me opportunities but didn\u2019t give me a sense of direction or fulfillment. I had to discover my own passions and work toward building something meaningful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe satisfaction of accomplishing goals through hard work was completely new to me.\u201d Rawal added that he wasn\u2019t set up for long-term success. \u201cWhile being raised in an affluent family provided privileges, it didn\u2019t set me up for long-term success,\u201d he said. \u201cThe skills I lacked \u2014 like budgeting, financial discipline and finding purpose \u2014 were much harder to develop as an adult. But going through that process gave me a much healthier perspective on money and a deeper appreciation for what really matters.\u201d For Rawal and others in his situation, it\u2019s key to gain perspective about what money can and can\u2019t provide. \u201cFor those raised in wealth, the biggest lesson is often learning that money alone does not solve life\u2019s challenges or buy happiness. True success comes from within,\u201d he said. Financial Literacy Based on Modeling \u201cI grew up in a fairly wealthy family. My father and mother own their own businesses, real estate and were heavily invested in the stock market,\u201d said Jordan Grumet, hospice doctor and author of The Purpose Code. \u201cWhat I generally found is that my parents modeled great behavior. They acted like rich people and thus as I got older, I tried to do the same things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saved and invested, so I saved and invested. They owned real estate, so I purchased real estate. They ran their own businesses, so I ran my own business.\u201d Grumet did see how his parents successfully managed their money but often lacked an understanding of how they did it. \u201cWhile I think my parents modeled great behavior, they often didn\u2019t tell me the exact how. I knew that investing in the stock market was important, but had no idea what stocks to pick,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t until later that Grumet realized the lessons he didn\u2019t learn. \u201cOnce I started buying property and being a landlord, I realized my parents had never really taught me the details needed to be a property owner,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same goes for owning a business. My parents provided me with the path but never really taught me how to traverse it.\u201d Now that Grumet is a parent, he\u2019s trying to teach his children these essential money lessons. \u201cAs a parent myself, I try to teach my kids about money in three important ways,\u201d he said. \u201cModeling: They see me earning, investing and creating wealth.\u201d Grumet said teaching is equally important. \u201cI use didactic methods to sit them down and explain exactly what I am doing and why.\u201d And finally, he noted that experiential learning is vital to teach kids. \u201cI give them opportunities to manage money, invest and handle debt but in a safe way in which the consequences are minimal,\u201d he said. \u201cA good example is that when they were young we used to give them a yearly allowance and then let them self-budget.\u201d More From GOBankingRates 5 Best Deals To Buy at Big Lots in July 2024I'm a Bank Teller: 9 Reasons You Should Never Ask for $2 Bills From the Bank3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I Grew Up Rich: 6 Money Lessons I Wish My Parents Would Have Taught Me", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grew-rich-6-money-lessons-180010744.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fvF5xiqKq5O_2ZHmCViGUw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/b53d62ea10ce487ef61dad9868a0c020", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:12:25", "author": "Cindy Lamothe", "authors": ["Cindy Lamothe"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.262}

The Huskers briefly took a three-run lead before Minnesota came charging back for a 7-5 win on Sunday.\n\nThe two teams combined for eight runs during a marathon fifth inning in which each side plated four runs. Nebraska (29-22, 12-9 Big Ten) trailed 2-1 heading into the frame, having surrendered a pair of RBI base hits while also stopping several Minnesota (27-24, 13-10) scoring threats.\n\nThe Huskers had been mostly quiet at the plate to that point but quickly batted around in the lineup with the help of a long two-out rally. Designated player Emmerson Cope, first baseman Bella Bacon and center fielder Brooke Andrews each hit RBI singles during a four-run frame that put Nebraska ahead 5-2.\n\nNU's surging momentum didn't last long, though, as Minnesota strung together six consecutive base hits to immediately regain a 6-5 lead. The surge knocked out Nebraska starting pitcher Sarah Harness, who occupied the circle for 16 2/3 of NU's 20 total innings this weekend.\n\nWith Harness needing a rest and senior Kaylin Kinney dealing with a minor injury, Nebraska turned to senior Caitlynn Neal for her second pitching appearance of the season. A key starting outfielder for the Huskers, Neal is a former pitcher who recently began practicing the position again to assist with Nebraska's limited depth.\n\nNeal recorded four outs, allowing a sixth-inning RBI double that extended Minnesota's lead to 7-5.\n\nMinnesota totaled 16 hits but stranded 11 runners while Nebraska had several missed opportunities of its own.\n\nWhen Nebraska loaded the bases with no outs in the second inning, it only managed to score one run on a fielder's choice. The Huskers nearly took a 2-1 lead on a one-out sacrifice fly, but the umpires determined that third-base runner Ava Bredwell left early and the scoring threat ended there.\n\nDouble plays beset Nebraska as the Huskers hit into three during the loss. A sixth-inning grounder stopped an opportunity with two runners on base and zero outs, then NU's final two outs of the game came on a line drive double play.\n\nNebraska can now turn its attention to next week's Big Ten Tournament, where the Huskers will be the No. 4 seed. Bypassing the tournament's opening round, Nebraska will play at 1:30 p.m. Thursday against either No. 5 Minnesota or No. 12 Illinois. The Huskers are on the same side of the bracket as Big Ten regular season champion Northwestern.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/c8/ac84ab30-4083-5b78-9c4a-f61d8320cd06/663844b438291.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555064", "eventUri": "eng-9555064", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The celebrations were well-deserved -- Andrews hit two home runs, including a three-run blast that capped a big run-rule win for Nebraska.\n\nNebraska's Big Ten Tournament run began with a commanding 11-2 quarterfinal win over Minnesota in five innings on Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa.\n\nNebraska (30-22) entered the matchup knowing that the Minnesota (28-25) batting order would be highly familiar with starting pitcher Sarah Harness. The Huskers had just played Minnesota in a three-game series over the weekend during which Harness handled the majority of the work -- and the senior lasted the entire game in the circle on Thursday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Minnesota shortstop led off the game with a solo home run to center field -- but the Gophers wouldn't manage much more off Harness.\n\nHarness allowed just two base hits and one run the rest of the way, a Minnesota RBI groundout late in the contest.\n\n\"Shoutout to Sarah Harness, she threw a really great game and our entire offense came out and attacked,\" Andrews said on the Big Ten Network.\n\nA hard-hitting Nebraska batting order tried its best to immediately counter Oakland's solo shot. Shortstop Billie Andrews and left fielder Samantha Bland both drove fly balls deep into center field, only for Minnesota to catch the drives at the warning track.\n\nTwo batters later, designated player Emmerson Cope finally broke through with a two-run blast to center field that struck the stadium's scoreboard.\n\nNebraska soon added to its lead in the third inning, taking advantage of a tired Minnesota pitching staff that had thrown nine innings the day before. Andrews hit a solo home run that got out in a hurry to put Nebraska ahead 3-1, then the Huskers loaded the bases with two outs and scored on a fielder's choice.\n\nAs Minnesota alternated between pitchers Macy Richardson and Jacie Hambrick in the fourth inning, Nebraska found success against both. The Huskers scored three runs without recording a base hit, loading the bases and scoring twice on RBI walks before pushing their lead to 7-1 on a sacrifice fly.\n\nNebraska scored nine runs over the game's final three innings to end the contest early. First baseman Bella Bacon hit an RBI single during the final frame before NU's all-time home run leader added another to her career total.\n\nAndrews' powerful three-run homer, Nebraska's third of the game, sailed over the center-field fence to put the Huskers into the tournament semifinals.\n\n\"I was just looking for a pitch that I could drive,\" Andrews said. \"I was honestly thinking, 'Be patient and find a good pitch,' and it came on the first pitch, so I was ready to attack.\"\n\nThe fourth-seeded Huskers will now face No. 8 seed Indiana at 4 p.m. Friday with a spot in the Big Ten championship game on the line.\n\nThe Hoosiers upset regular-season champion Northwestern earlier in the day, one of three matchups thus far in the conference tournament where the lower-seeded team has won.

The Huskers won the weekend series and ended the regular season with a 29-22 record and a fourth-place finish in the Big Ten with a 12-9 conference record.\n\nIn a game filled with base runners, eight of the 12 runs scored in the fifth inning. Nebraska trailed 2-1 before scoring four times with two outs in the top of the fifth to take a 5-2 lead. But Minnesota came back with four two-out runs of its own in the bottom of the fifth, regaining a lead it would not relinquish.\n\nMinnesota had 16 hits in the game, while Nebraska had 11 hits. The teams combined for 20 hits with runners on base, but a total of six double plays limited the scoring. The Huskers stranded seven base runners while the Gophers left 11 on base in their six innings.\n\nSydney Gray (2-for-4), Ava Bredwell (2-for-2), Bella Bacon (2-for-3) and Katelyn Caneda (2-for-3) all had two hits, with Gray and Bacon adding an RBI. Brooke Andrews drove in a pair of runs while Emmerson Cope also had an RBI.\n\nSarah Harness started and pitched well until the fifth inning, which marked her 16th inning of the weekend. Harness (8-5) took the loss after allowing six runs in 4.2 innings. Caitlynn Neal pitched the final 1.1 innings and gave up one run on one hit.\n\nMacy Richardson (6-5) earned the complete-game win for Minnesota, which ended the regular season with a 27-24 record and a 13-10 mark in Big Ten play.\n\nMinnesota scored once in the bottom of the first to take a 1-0 lead. A leadoff walk was followed by back-to-back doubles to score the game's first run. After a pop out, a hit batter loaded the bases with one out before Nebraska turned an inning-ending double play.\n\nNebraska tied the game in the top of the second. Cope was hit by a pitch to start the inning, Bredwell singled and Bacon added another single to load the bases with no outs. Brooke Andrews then reached on an RBI fielder's choice that scored pinch runner Mckinley Malecha with Nebraska's first run. The Huskers still had runners at second and third with only one out when Neal hit an apparent sacrifice fly to center that brought Bredwell home but Bredwell was ruled to have left third base early and was called out to end the inning.\n\nNebraska turned a double play to thwart a Minnesota scoring threat in the bottom of the third, and the Gophers returned the favor with an inning-ending double play in the top of the fourth.\n\nMinnesota then grabbed a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the fourth. The Gophers had runners at first and second with one out when an RBI double gave Minnesota the lead. The Gophers still had runners at second and third with one out but Harness escaped the jam without further damage.\n\nNebraska answered with four two-out runs in the top of the fifth to take a 5-2 lead. Neal and Caneda began the inning with back-to-back singles. The next two batters were retired before Gray had a clutch two-out, RBI single that scored Neal with the tying run.\n\nMinnesota came right back with four two-out runs in the bottom of the inning to regain the lead at 6-5. The first two batters were retired before an infield single got the rally started. Another single put two runners on base before back-to-back doubles brought three runs home to tie the game at 5-5. An RBI single then gave the Gophers a 6-5 lead.\n\nIn the top of the sixth, Caneda singled and Billie Andrews walked to put Huskers on first and second with no outs. But Nebraska hit into its third double play of the game before a fly out ended the threat.\n\nMinnesota then added an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth on a one-out RBI double gave the Gophers a 7-5 lead.\n\nIn the top of the seventh, Bredwell singled with one out to bring the tying run to the plate, but Bacon lined into a game-ending double play.\n\nWith the regular season complete, Nebraska will turn its attention to the Big Ten Tournament. The Huskers earned the No. 4 seed for the tournament and will take on the winner of the Minnesota-Illinois game at 1:30 p.m. on Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa.", "source": {"uri": "sandhillsexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sandhills Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_runner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch runner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Complete game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infield hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Wallyball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media-news-affiliates.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/uploads/2021/09/huskers-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555064", "eventUri": "eng-9555064", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It's the Huskers fourth loss to the Jackrabbits ever. NU finished the year 1-6 in midweek games since the beginning of April.\n\nAt RPI No. 249, South Dakota State represents the Huskers' worst loss of the season by a wide margin. The Jackrabbits were swept by Northern Colorado over the weekend.\n\n\"It obviously stinks,\" Nebraska head coach Will Bolt said postgame. \"You leave the door a little bit cracked and they've got a good offensive lineup. You've got a chance to go finish that thing off, you've got a four-run lead with two innings to go, that should be enough to finish the game. It wasn't. Credit to them, they were on the right side of some pretty big swings tonight.\"\n\nHere's more on one more devastating midweek flush with miscues.\n\nJoin HuskerOnline today and get your first month of a premium subscription for just $1!\n\nFor a moment, it looked as if Nebraska was set to pull away. The Huskers led 3-2 entering the bottom of the fifth and added runs in the next three innings to take a 6-2 advantage into the eighth. NU had plenty of momentum and a strong cushion for upperclassman righties Rans Sanders and Casey Daiss. Five different Huskers had recorded RBIs.\n\n\"We put pressure on them in every inning and we scored six runs, but just one, not multiple runs in an inning,\" Bolt said.\n\nThen, the tide turned.\n\nThere were warning signs. Nebraska left the bases loaded in the first after filling the bags with one out. Only a run came across. In the seventh, the Jackrabbits loaded the bases with two outs in the before Kyle Perry closed the door.\n\nThe dam began to crack in the eighth. A hot-shot single to third and an error by Carey on a potential double-play ball at short set the table for Thatcher Kozal, who launched a Rans Sanders offering to deep right and made it 6-5. Casey Daiss was the next Husker to get the ball out of the pen. He got Nebraska out of the eighth and recorded the first out of the ninth before disaster struck.\n\nThe Jackrabbits delivered four straight singles to take the lead at 7-6. With two more aboard, Kozal went yard again to the same spot in right. His second blast of the night blew the game open at 10-6.\n\nKozal finsiehd the night 4-for-5 with a double, two home runs and six RBIs. He entered the evening with a .200 batting average, three blasts and six RBIs.\n\nNebraska had all of it's top bullpen arms available and couldn't get the job done.\n\n\"You could second guess any move that was made in the pen tonight,\" Bolt said.\n\nGabe Swansen's leadoff single gave the Huskers a bit of hope. Nebraska loaded the bases with two outs and brought the tying run to the plate in Josh Caron. But, the junior catcher struck out on a half-hearted swing to seal the win for South Dakota State.\n\nOf all of Nebraska's midweek defeats this year, this is by far the most confusing. The Huskers had an extra day to prepare, a stocked bullpen and plenty of opportunities to blow the game open. NU closed out the game 1-for-14 (.071) with runners in scoring position and stranded 14 runners on base.\n\nThe Huskers midweek malaise is something that the players are certainly aware of.\n\n\"It's definitely a focus thing,\" Overbeek said. \"We play on the weekends and you get three games against a team, and to go on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and play teams that are closer to you, and (they) really treat us and games against us like a World Series, it definitely creeps into your brain a bit.\"\n\nIn the end, much of Nebraska's issues on Tuesdays and Wednesdays come down to agression.\n\n\"That's something we have to go out and take full responsibility to not ask for the big hit, not ask for the game to give us a call or bounce our way,\" Overbeek said. \"You've gotta go out and be prepared and be ready to go. When the opportunity presents itself, to take it and run with it and not turn back. We let these guys hang around tonight.\"\n\n\"When you're asking for the game to give you something, it usually doesn't go your way.\"\n\nNebraska wraps up its home slate by hosting Indiana for a three-game set this weekend. The Hoosiers and Huskers are tied for second in the Big Ten standings with a shared record of 12-6. All three games will be televised, starting with Friday's series opener at 6:05 p.m. CT on Nebraska Public Media.\n\nThe final two contests can be found on the Big Ten Network on Saturday at 6:05 p.m. CT and Sunday at 12:05 p.m. CT.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_hansen@on3.com", "name": "Grant Hansen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_State_Jackrabbits", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota State Jackrabbits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Northern_Colorado", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Northern Colorado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rensselaer_Polytechnic_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Public_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska Public Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Hoosiers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain tumor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/02/29165202/Copy-of-Copy-of-On3-Matt-Zenitz-don-meyer-leadership-2024-02-29T165141.584.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555064", "eventUri": "eng-9555064", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Case Sanderson recorded two hits, while Ben Columbus and Cole Evans each tallied a double.\n\nWill Walsh dropped to 4-4 on the year after giving up three runs on four hits in 2.1 innings. Bobb Olsen recorded a pair of outs without giving up a run for the Huskers. Drew Christo tossed two innings, allowing two runs without giving up a hit and striking out four Gophers.\n\nGrant Cleavinger and Kyle Froehlich combined to pitch two innings, while surrendering one run on one hit. Kyle Perry dealt a scoreless eighth inning to round out the action from the NU pitching staff.\n\nMinnesota jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the opening inning with three consecutive hits to begin the bottom of the first. Back-to-back doubles plated the game's first run, while an RBI single to left doubled the lead for the Gophers.\n\nEvans blooped a one-out double down the right-field line and moved to third on a groundout in the second, but the Big Red couldn't get Evans home to cut into the deficit.\n\nA one-out solo homer to left-center in the bottom of the third grew the lead to three for the Gophers.\n\nThe Husker offense scratched across its first run of the day behind a pair of hits in the fourth inning. Caron opened the inning with a single to left, while Columbus was plunked to put runners on first and second with one out. Evans appeared to cut into the Gopher lead with a run-scoring hit that went over the third-base bag down the left-field line but was ruled foul.\n\nSanderson drove in NU's first run of the day, blooping an RBI single to shallow left field to score Caron from second and make it a 3-1 game.\n\nNebraska tacked on another run in the sixth to come within a run of the Gophers. Caron opened the inning with a double down the left-field line and moved to third on a wild pitch. Tyler Stone lifted a sacrifice fly to right to bring home Caron and make it a 3-2 game.\n\nThe Huskers continued the threat in the inning after the Big Red had the bases loaded following Columbus' double down the right-field line and walks to Sanderson and Dylan Carey, but a flyout to right prevented the Huskers from plating the tying run.\n\nMinnesota added three runs on one hit in the sixth to grow the lead to 6-2.

She saw Kaylin Kinney, the Huskers' leader in inning pitched, and channeled her energy.\n\n\"She has gutted out the last (few) weekends of Big Ten play and we've just been right in each other hip pockets supporting each other,\" Harness said. \"She's been a big motivation for me.\"\n\nEven with a depleted pitching staff, fourth-seeded Nebraska (29-22) will be in contention for a Big Ten Tournament title this week in Iowa City.\n\nThe injuries have come in waves. The first, a season-ending ACL injury suffered by Jordy Bahl in NU's season opener, immediately meant heavier workloads for Nebraska's remaining pitchers. Freshman Caitlin Olensky quickly stepped up, tossing 46 2/3 innings before a muscle injury ended her season in mid-March.\n\nFreshman Emmerson Cope, whom Nebraska had planned to utilize mainly as a hitter, missed several weeks with a back injury while throwing 39 2/3 innings over the course of the season.\n\nNow it's Kinney, NU's workhorse with 148-plus innings pitched this season, who's been sidelined. Head coach Rhonda Revelle said a minor injury has flared up again for Kinney, whose status is day-to-day heading into the Big Ten Tournament.\n\nKinney pitched just two innings against Minnesota, but Nebraska is hopeful she'll be available to pitch in the coming days.\n\nIf not, that means plenty of innings for Harness with the chance of another surprise cameo from senior Caitlynn Neal. An outfielder with previous pitching experience, Neal relieved Harness on Sunday in her second pitching appearance of the season -- a performance Harness said was \"gutsy\" and inspiring.\n\nIt's yet another example of the fighting spirit Nebraska has displayed throughout its season. In addition to its two pitchers who are done for the season, four positional players have also suffered season-ending injuries.\n\n\"You can tell the heart that this team has,\" Harness said. \"This team has taken a lot of adversity, and I think we've handled it with grace and learned from it.\"\n\nRevelle reminded her team of that fact in Nebraska's final practice at home on Tuesday before departing for Iowa City.\n\nIt wasn't Revelle's message that truly hit home, though. Former Lincoln Southwest softball coach Mark Watt, who served as a volunteer coach on last season's Husker softball team, shared a lesson about his personal health battle.\n\n\"I asked him, 'What's your best advice for us?'\" Revelle said. \"He goes, 'You never quit. Your body might not feel great, you might be fighting this and that, but you can always have your mentality.' That was wisdom right there, and that's how we're approaching it.\"\n\nSeeded fourth in the single-elimination event, Nebraska will play its quarterfinal contest at 1:30 p.m. Thursday against Minnesota, a matchup that pits the Huskers against the team they just faced in a three-game series.\n\nTop-seeded Northwestern or eighth-seeded Indiana would be Nebraska's semifinal opponent, but Revelle and Harness aren't looking ahead. Taking things one game and one pitch at a team has kept Nebraska level-headed and competitive throughout the season's adversity -- and the Huskers aren't changing now.\n\nHowever, every single game has the added importance of potentially contributing to Nebraska's NCAA Tournament chances. NU could guarantee its place in the field by winning the conference tournament, but if it falls short, an at-large bid remains a slim possibility.\n\nMost national projections place Nebraska just outside the NCAA Tournament as one of the first four to six teams left out of the postseason field. The Huskers rank No. 47 in national RPI with a 4-14 record against Quadrant 1 opponents, an area where other bubble teams have stronger resumes.\n\nAdditionally, programs such as Utah, Wichita State and Penn State are also on the bubble -- and all three would hold a head-to-head advantage over Nebraska having beaten the Huskers during the regular season.\n\nWould one or two wins from the Big Ten Tournament be enough to vault Nebraska into the NCAA Tournament field? Revelle doesn't know for sure.\n\n\"I don't know what we've got to do to get in, but I have to stay focused on the fact that even when it hasn't been pretty, we've fought,\" Revelle said. \"I don't know if we have to win one, two or the whole thing to have a shot, or if we need help from other teams; it could be all of the above.\"\n\nThere's only one certainty as Nebraska enters the conference tournament -- win three games and NU's improbable, wild softball season will last for at least one more weekend.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors":

One of those two squads, Indiana (27-19-1, 12-6), comes to the Star City this weekend. Just 1.5 games separate conference leader Illinois and fifth-place Iowa.\n\nHead coach Will Bolt's squad finishes with the Hoosiers and then at Michigan State next weekend. Indiana has won five straight Big Ten series.\n\n\"You've got to fight for what you want,\" Bolt said. \"We've been working hard just like everyone else has for the last nine months. You don't get to this point by hoping somebody else screws it up for you. You've gotta go take it, you've gotta go earn it, you've gotta go fight for it and you've gotta run through the finish line.\"\n\nHere's more on the Huskers' final home stand, their opponent and what's on the line at Haymarket Park.\n\nJoin HuskerOnline today and get your first month of a premium subscription for just $1!\n\nFriday, 6:05 p.m., RHP Brett Sears (Stats: 7-0, 2.18 ERA, 78.1 IP, 77 K) vs. LHP Ty Bothwell (Stats: 6-2, 5.46 ERA, 61.0 IP, 62 K)\n\nSaturday, 6:05 p.m., RHP Mason McConnaughey (Stats: 6-3, 3.19 ERA, 48.0 IP, 55 K) Vs. RHP Connor Foley (Stats: 4-1, 4.53 ERA, 47.2 IP, 67 K)\n\nIf this weekend wasn't already important enough, Wednesday's late collapse and 10-6 loss to South Dakota State added another layer of intrigue to this Indiana series. Theoretically, Nebraska could finish as low as 11th in the conference standings in a doomsday scenario.\n\nTaking a series win over the Hoosiers (RPI 60) would set the Huskers up well in the conference standings for the final week and provide a needed RPI boost.\n\n\"We haven't really looked big picture,\" NU ace Brett Sears said in a Thursday media session. \"We just try to stay one game at a time and go from there.\"\n\nSears added that he doesn't look at the standings much. Nebraska's destiny is in its own hands. Fellow senior pitcher Kyle Perry said the team tries to stick to its mantra of staying in the present.\n\nBut, it's hard to miss the discourse on Twitter.\n\n\"It's something that we're thinking about in terms of trying to remain at the top to give ourselves a shot,\" Perry said. \"Trying to attack the game that's in front of us each day is our goal. So it's crucial these next couple of weeks, but this weekend is big time.\"\n\nWho walks on Senior Day?\n\nNebraska will honor 11 seniors this weekend. Senior Day falls on a Saturday this year due to Sunday's Mother's Day festivities.\n\nThe Huskers will honor Clay Bradford, Garrett Anglim, Ben Columbus, Cole Evans, Bryce Hughes, Bobby Olsen, Kyle Froehlich, Rans Sanders, Will Walsh, Sears and Perry. Anglim, Walsh and Hughes are all redshirt juniors.\n\nHe's pitched in all six seasons of his collegiate career and was granted extra seasons due to COVID-19 and a medial hardship waiver. This year he leads the team with 21 total appearances and is third on the team with three saves.\n\n\"I think he's just in it for the gifts,\" Bolt joked.\n\nPerry clarified he didn't get a senior gift during the 2022 season. He still does have his framed jersey from last year's Senior Day. Bolt went on to commend the southpaw for his leadership this season, it's a role Perry has relished.\n\nHe's also the only player remaining from 2021's Big Ten Championship team and NCAA Regional qualifier. That time of year is rapidly approaching again as the Huskers hope to break their postseason drought. Perry said the most noticeable difference is how everyone hangs on each pitch in the postseason. Now it's time to find another gear.\n\n\"We definitely have it in us, and the last couple of weeks we could definitely have taken that up a notch,\" Perry said. \"That's the next level this team can take. Just taking everything we've done and bumping it up a notch and taking us to that next level. That's what it's gonna take for us to succeed down the stretch. I hope the boys are up to the challenge but I definitely think we have it in us.\"\n\n***Case Sanderson has reached base in a team-leading 19 consecutive games. In that stretch, he is hitting .370 (20-for-54) with five extra-base and seven RBIs.\n\n***Riley Silva is Nebraska's first player to swipe 29 or more bases in a season since Jamal Strong stole 35 in 2000. He has also been hit by a pitch 22 times this season. Daniel Bruce owns the record for HBPs in a season at 28 set in 2002.\n\n***The Huskers are one of 15 teams nationally to be in the top 75 of ERA (32nd, 4.51), fielding percentage (60th, .975) and batting average (71st, .294).\n\n***Nebraska leads the all-time series with the Hoosiers 16-14-1. Indiana won a series over the Huskers 2-1 during the 2022 season in Bloomington. IU is making its first trip to Lincoln this weekend since 2018.\n\n***Indiana catcher Brock Tibbitts is just 14 hits away from reach 200 in his career. He would be the 25th Hoosier to reach that mark. He missed a month of this season due to a lower-leg injury and made his return against Purdue last week.\n\n***Last weekend, Indiana scored 15 runs in the seventh inning or later. All 10 of the Hoosiers runs on Sunday came during the game's final three innings, including four of those runs with two outs in the ninth.\n\n***The IU bullpen pitched 20 1/3 innings this past weekend and allowed five earned runs. The series win over Purdue in West Lafayette was the Hoosiers' first since 2002.\n\n***Indiana has gone 2-1 in each of its three conference road series this year. The last time the Hoosiers went a perfect 4-for-4 was 2014 when the team finished 44-15 and bested Nebraska in the Big Ten Championship by a 8-4 margin.\n\n***Player to watch: OF Devin Taylor\n\nTaylor is the reigning Big Ten Freshman of the Year and earned consensus Freshman All-American honors after setting the freshman record for RBI in a season (59) last year. He closed the year with a .315 batting average with 16 homers and 13 doubles to go with his RBI total. Taylor has improved his average to .362 this season along with 12 home runs and 38 RBI.\n\nOn a team full of talented hitters, he is one to keep an eye on.\n\nHere are a few Big Ten series to keep tabs on this weekend as well as the conference standings. Records are as of Wednesday evening:", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_hansen@on3.com", "name": "Grant Hansen", "type": "author",

The celebrations were well-deserved -- Andrews hit two home runs, including a three-run blast that capped a big run-rule win for Nebraska.\n\nNebraska's Big Ten Tournament run began with a commanding 11-2 quarterfinal win over Minnesota in five innings on Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa.\n\nNebraska (30-22) entered the matchup knowing that the Minnesota (28-25) batting order would be highly familiar with starting pitcher Sarah Harness. The Huskers had just played Minnesota in a three-game series over the weekend during which Harness handled the majority of the work -- and the senior lasted the entire game in the circle on Thursday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The Minnesota shortstop led off the game with a solo home run to center field -- but the Gophers wouldn't manage much more off Harness.\n\nHarness allowed just two base hits and one run the rest of the way, a Minnesota RBI groundout late in the contest.\n\n\"Shoutout to Sarah Harness, she threw a really great game and our entire offense came out and attacked,\" Andrews said on the Big Ten Network.\n\nA hard-hitting Nebraska batting order tried its best to immediately counter Oakland's solo shot. Shortstop Billie Andrews and left fielder Samantha Bland both drove fly balls deep into center field, only for Minnesota to catch the drives at the warning track.\n\nTwo batters later, designated player Emmerson Cope finally broke through with a two-run blast to center field that struck the stadium's scoreboard.\n\nNebraska soon added to its lead in the third inning, taking advantage of a tired Minnesota pitching staff that had thrown nine innings the day before. Andrews hit a solo home run that got out in a hurry to put Nebraska ahead 3-1, then the Huskers loaded the bases with two outs and scored on a fielder's choice.\n\nAs Minnesota alternated between pitchers Macy Richardson and Jacie Hambrick in the fourth inning, Nebraska found success against both. The Huskers scored three runs without recording a base hit, loading the bases and scoring twice on RBI walks before pushing their lead to 7-1 on a sacrifice fly.\n\nNebraska scored nine runs over the game's final three innings to end the contest early. First baseman Bella Bacon hit an RBI single during the final frame before NU's all-time home run leader added another to her career total.\n\nAndrews' powerful three-run homer, Nebraska's third of the game, sailed over the center-field fence to put the Huskers into the tournament semifinals.\n\n\"I was just looking for a pitch that I could drive,\" Andrews said. \"I was honestly thinking, 'Be patient and find a good pitch,' and it came on the first pitch, so I was ready to attack.\"\n\nThe fourth-seeded Huskers will now face No. 8 seed Indiana at 4 p.m. Friday with a spot in the Big Ten championship game on the line.\n\nThe Hoosiers upset regular-season champion Northwestern earlier in the day, one of three matchups thus far in the conference tournament where the lower-seeded team has won. Indiana may not be a typical underdog, though -- the Hoosiers lost in last season's championship game and had a slow start to conference play before coming on strong down the stretch this season.\n\nPhotos: No. 21 Northwestern softball visits Huskers for weekend series Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 Northwestern vs. Nebraska softball, 4.26 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags College-sports Omaha.com Journalstar.com Nebraska Softball Husker Softball Sports Baseball Games And Toys Cricket Softball Subscribe for the best Husker news & commentary Episode 130 The Showdown: Nebraska volleyball's spring match and softball on the NCAA bubble Episode 129 The Showdown: Nebraska quarterbacks in spring game and Husker volleyball's spring match * Texts from columnists * The most breaking Husker news * Cutting-edge commentary * Husker history photo galleries Get started Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

The Big Ten leader in earned-run average and No. 2 in strikeouts (77) said his relative struggles have been more mental than mechanical as he works to regain the \"prove it\" attitude he brought most of the spring. \"Just continue to tell myself I haven't done anything,\" Sears said. \"I think that's the best spot for me to be mentally. I think I need to get back to that and I'm going to get back to that these next few weeks.\"\n\nNU is staying open about its Sunday starter, which could include left-hander Will Walsh, Jackson Brockett or others depending on who is needed earlier in the series. Second baseman Cayden Brumbaugh took live batting practice Thursday for the first time since his hand injury that has kept him out the last eight games and may return to action this weekend. Coach Will Bolt said there may be some pain but little risk of further injury for the redshirt sophomore hitting .336 with 11 steals.\n\nHow does a program near the bottom of the Big Ten in pitching and defense enter the stretch run a game out of first place? By scoring a lot of runs. The Hoosiers feature their usual collection of powerful and athletic hitters who don't risk outs with bunts or stolen-base attempts but instead play for the big inning. They often get it with a lineup that leads the league in scoring (8.5 runs/game, 31st nationally) and doubles. Preseason B1G Player of the Year Devin Taylor (.356, 12 homers) has been productive along with Nick Mitchell (.359) and Joey Brenczewski (.356) while Josh Pyne and Tyler Cerny are among the top two-bagger duos in the country with a combined 39.\n\nA collective ERA of 6.45 (185th) is perhaps inflated considering IU misses bats (10 strikeouts per nine innings, 30th) and generally shows command (4.6 walks allowed per nine, 129th). Yet all but four Hoosiers hurlers hold ERAs above 5 including Bothwell, a sixth-year lefty with 211 strikeouts in 178 1/3 career innings. Sixty errors are the most in the Big Ten for a program coming off an NCAA regional under sixth-year coach Jeff Mercer. An RPI of 60 means it will probably need to win the league tournament later this month to return to the postseason.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"},

The Big Ten leader in earned-run average and No. 2 in strikeouts (77) said his relative struggles have been more mental than mechanical as he works to regain the \"prove it\" attitude he brought most of the spring.\n\n\"Just continue to tell myself I haven't done anything,\" Sears said. \"I think that's the best spot for me to be mentally. I think I need to get back to that and I'm going to get back to that these next few weeks.\"\n\nNU is staying open about its Sunday starter, which could include left-hander Will Walsh, Jackson Brockett or others depending on who is needed earlier in the series. Second baseman Cayden Brumbaugh took live batting practice Thursday for the first time since his hand injury that has kept him out the last eight games and may return to action this weekend.\n\nCoach Will Bolt said there may be some pain but little risk of further injury for the redshirt sophomore hitting .336 with 11 steals.\n\nScouting Indiana (27-19-1, 12-6)\n\nHow does a program near the bottom of the Big Ten in pitching and defense enter the stretch run a game out of first place? By scoring a lot of runs. The Hoosiers feature their usual collection of powerful and athletic hitters who don't risk outs with bunts or stolen-base attempts but instead play for the big inning.\n\nThey often get it with a lineup that leads the league in scoring (8.5 runs/game, 31st nationally) and doubles. Preseason B1G Player of the Year Devin Taylor (.356, 12 homers) has been productive along with Nick Mitchell (.359) and Joey Brenczewski (.356) while Josh Pyne and Tyler Cerny are among the top two-bagger duos in the country with a combined 39.\n\nA collective ERA of 6.45 (185th) is perhaps inflated considering IU misses bats (10 strikeouts per nine innings, 30th) and generally shows command (4.6 walks allowed per nine, 129th). Yet all but four Hoosiers hurlers hold ERAs above 5 including Bothwell, a sixth-year lefty with 211 strikeouts in 178 1/3 career innings.\n\nSixty errors are the most in the Big Ten for a program coming off an NCAA regional under sixth-year coach Jeff Mercer. An RPI of 60 means it will probably need to win the league tournament later this month to return to the postseason.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Omaha.com Journalstar.com

The celebrations were well-deserved -- Andrews hit two home runs, including a three-run blast that capped a big run-rule win for Nebraska.\n\nNebraska's Big Ten Tournament run began with a commanding 11-2 quarterfinal win over Minnesota in five innings on Thursday in Iowa City.\n\nNebraska (30-22) entered the matchup knowing that the Minnesota (28-25) batting order would be highly familiar with starting pitcher Sarah Harness. The Huskers had just played Minnesota in a three-game series over the weekend where Harness handled the majority of the work -- and the senior lasted the entire game in the circle on Thursday.\n\nMinnesota's Jess Oakland wasted no time proving why she was recently named the Big Ten's player of the year. The Minnesota shortstop led off the game with a solo home run to center field -- but the Gophers wouldn't manage much more off Harness.\n\nHarness allowed just two base hits and one run the rest of the way, a Minnesota RBI groundout late in the contest.\n\n\"Shoutout to Sarah Harness, she threw a really great game and our entire offense came out and attacked,\" Andrews said on the Big Ten Network.\n\nA hard-hitting Nebraska batting order tried its best to immediately counter Oakland's solo shot. Shortstop Billie Andrews and left fielder Samantha Bland both drove fly balls deep into center field, only for Minnesota to catch the drives at the warning track.\n\nTwo batters later, designated player Emmerson Cope finally broke through with a two-run blast to center field which struck the stadium's scoreboard.\n\nNebraska soon added to its lead in the third inning, taking advantage of a tired Minnesota pitching staff that had thrown nine innings the day prior. Andrews hit a solo home run that got out in a hurry to put Nebraska ahead 3-1, then the Huskers loaded the bases with two outs and scored on a fielder's choice.\n\nAs Minnesota alternated between pitchers Macy Richardson and Jacie Hambrick in the fourth inning, Nebraska found success against both. The Huskers scored three runs without recording a base hit, loading the bases and scoring twice on RBI walks before pushing their lead to 7-1 on a sacrifice fly.\n\nNebraska scored nine runs over the game's final three innings to end the contest early. First baseman Bella Bacon hit an RBI single during the final frame before NU's all-time home run leader added another to her career total.\n\nAndrews' powerful three-run homer, Nebraska's third of the game, sailed over the center field fence to put the Huskers into the tournament semifinals.\n\n\"I was just looking for a pitch that I could drive,\" Andrews said. \"I was honestly thinking, 'Be patient and find a good pitch,' and it came on the first pitch, so I was ready to attack.\"\n\nThe fourth-seeded Huskers will now face No. 8 seed Indiana at 4 p.m. on Friday with a spot in the Big Ten championship game on the line.\n\nThe Hoosiers upset regular-season champion Northwestern earlier in the day, one of three matchups thus far in the conference tournament where the lower-seeded team has won. Indiana may not be a typical underdog, though -- the Hoosiers lost in last season's championship game and had a slow start to conference play before coming on strong down the stretch this year.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska softball shuts out Creighton", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warning track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creighton_Bluejays_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creighton Bluejays men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Hoosiers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielder's_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielder's choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/8a/88af6e91-b827-583f-9cef-8957669c4df1/663d574e0de49.preview.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555064", "eventUri": "eng-9555064", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 452993052, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 12, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 12}}}

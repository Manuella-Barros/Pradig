He lost the fight, but won a major victory that day by becoming the first transgender athlete to officially compete in a Cuban sports league. Reyes, a 26-year-old transgender man, competed for the first time in the male 60/65-kilogram (132/143-pound) category of sanda, a demanding contact sport that blends martial arts like kung fu with kickboxing. The June 1 milestone marked the latest step toward inclusion in Cuba, one of Latin America\u2019s most progressive countries when it comes to LGBTQ rights. Yet, Reyes himself acknowledges having to overcome challenges, including the lack of medications, a law that sets conditions to change his gender on his ID and the \u201csuspicious looks\u201d he sometimes gets from people in the street. \u201cEducating society doesn\u2019t happen in two days,\u201d he said. Reyes, who lives with his girlfriend in a colorful house on the outskirts of Havana, supports himself by repairing air conditioners, as his sanda fights are unpaid. He has been on hormone therapy for two years, but says he does not want full genital reassignment surgery. His transition has been far from easy. It began over four years ago when he visited Cuba\u2019s Center for Sexual Education and consulted with a psychologist. He then saw endocrinologists and underwent tests to obtain a \u201ctarjet\u00f3n,\u201d a special card that allows Cubans to purchase medication at pharmacies, enabling him to get the hormones needed for his transition. But as Cuba\u2019s economic crisis deepened, medications became scarce so he had to rely on other people who brought testosterone from abroad. While not illegal, the practice can be very expensive. \u201cI\u2019m an athlete; I can\u2019t neglect my hormone treatment. ... I have to stay on top of it,\u201d he said. Changing his identity in official documents posed yet another challenge. While Reyes was able to legally change his name last year, his ID card still displays an \u201cF\u201d for female. That is because Cuba\u2019s current law requires full genital reassignment surgery for this change \u2014 something he does not want to do. LGTBQ activists in Cuba say a solution could come soon through a new Civil Registry law currently being drafted in the National Assembly that would allow people to change their gender on their ID cards \u2014 or eliminate this requirement altogether. The changes stem from Cuba\u2019s 2019 constitution, which gave way to the 2022 Family Code that allowed same-sex couples to marry and adopt as well as surrogacy pregnancies among other rights. Though approved via referendum by a large majority, the measure faced opposition from evangelical groups and other conservative groups that disagreed with its provisions. While Reyes\u2019s ID still formally identifies him as female, sports authorities accepted his male status based on his hormone treatments, medical reports and self-identification. This allowed him to compete in the male category of the Cuban Fighters League. \u201cIt\u2019s something new; it\u2019s a challenge that I have embraced with much love,\u201d said Reyes\u2019s coach, Frank Caz\u00f3n C\u00e1rdenas, the president of Cuba\u2019s sanda community who handled the athlete\u2019s registration. Caz\u00f3n said he had to work on two fronts to make it happen: discussing Reyes with the other sanda male team members \u2014 and securing approval from the powerful Cuban Sports Institute, which ultimately authorized Reyes to participate in the male category. Cuba\u2019s LGBTQ community celebrated Reyes\u2019s milestone, noting it was the result of a hard-fought battle. \u201cIt was only a matter of time,\u201d said Francisco \u201cPaquito\u201d Rodr\u00edguez Cruz, a well-known LGBTQ rights activist in Cuba, referring to the sports institute\u2019s unprecedented greenlight for a transgender athlete to take part in an official competition. \u201cIt\u2019s the logical consequence of what has been done in the last 15 or 20 years.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a cultural process of change that is still controversial,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. ___ Follow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2N1YmEtdHJhbnNnZW5kZXItYXRobGV0ZS1zYW5kYS1sZ2J0cS00Y2JjZDU4M2ZkMWQyM2JjOTNlYzAyYTE0OGI1ZTZmNdIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Cuba's first transgender athlete shows the progress and challenges faced by LGBTQ people</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/cuba-transgender-athlete-sanda-lgbtq-4cbcd583fd1d23bc93ec02a148b5e6f5", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/292c6cf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4869x2739+0+254/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F74%2Fab%2F1be2d1f3a9ac211a1ab87e0adeb5%2Fdb5c5630414c497b8f242fb7f544d9e7", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:40:27", "author": "Andrea Rodr\u00edguez", "authors": ["Andrea Rodr\u00edguez"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.138}

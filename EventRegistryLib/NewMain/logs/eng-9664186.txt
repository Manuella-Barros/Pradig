Luckily we are experts in ultra-high performance electric powertrains, so the idea was complementing the 'old school' combustion engine with a very high performance electric powertrain.\n\n\"So one electric motor in the rear, two in the front and quite a substantial battery pack with 25kWh that delivers the power but also usable electric powertrain when you need it.\n\n\"The electric powertrain is actually an enabler for such an emotional engine, because without it we wouldn't have this performance\".\n\nMr Rimac stopped short of providing any details about power and torque outputs, and we don't yet know how large the V16 engine is - but we know how good it sounds.\n\nFor context, Bugatti's 8.0-litre W16 quad-turbo engine was capable of producing up to 1361kW of power and 1850Nm of torque.\n\nThe all-electric Rimac Nevera hypercar develops 1408kW and 2360Nm from its four electric motors, which power each wheel individually.\n\nThough many expected the next Bugatti to be all-electric after Rimac took a 55 per cent stake in the brand - with the remaining 45 per cent held by Porsche - Mr Rimac said doing so would have been akin to taking the easy path.\n\n\"There were many naysayers, saying the next car has to be electric or 'you don't have the experience to build a hypercar'\", Mr Rimac said.\n\n\"'It's way too complicated, you don't know what you're getting yourself into, or how are you going to develop a combustion engine car? You have never done this before.'\n\n\"My answer was: 'I haven't done anything before whatever I have done in the last 15 years.' We had no right to do any of that, especially starting in a country that didn't have a car industry.\n\n\"So we had confidence that we could do it together with the colleagues from Bugatti after joining forces.\"\n\nBugatti's as-yet unnamed hypercar is due to be revealed on June 20, European time.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Nevera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Nevera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 25}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-15072150/6f1b4f8f31537f380aa579c125d9dc2c09a5827a-16x9-x0y132w2532h1424.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2594, "textEnd": 2601}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Sure, there have been a multitude of special editions but they've all been based on the same cars-the Veyron and Chiron. The former came out in 2005 while the latter broke cover in 2016, so it's high time for a truly new car. The Molsheim-based elite marque has been hyping up the car for a while, and all will finally be revealed today.\n\nIt's almost unbelievable that in the age of downsizing, Bugatti dares to put a V-16 engine in a production car. We're all for it, of course. The W-16 replacement will eschew those four turbochargers by taking the naturally aspirated route. In the build-up to the world premiere, a teaser video featuring head honcho Mate Rimac reveals some of the other juicy secrets.\n\nWe get to learn the new Bugatti will indeed feature a hybrid powertrain based around the monstrous sixteen-cylinder engine. After taking out the turbos, the engineers found a solution to replace the extra grunt provided by forced induction in the two preceding models. Make that three since the EB110 launched before the VW era also had a quad-turbo setup. The unnamed \"French\" hypercar will use Rimac know-how by featuring no fewer than three electric motors.\n\nOne e-motor will sit at the rear and the other two will be installed at the front axle. The upcoming Bugatti will rely on a mid-mounted battery pack with a 25-kWh capacity to juice up the motors and even deliver an unspecified amount of electric range. This low-slung sports car could've been radically different considering Volkswagen's original plan was to indirectly replace the Chiron with an electric SUV.\n\nMate Rimac took advantage of his newly acquired deciding power to convince the higher-ups from VW to build a hypercar. The next Bugatti will play in a rarified segment of V-16 cars, right up there with the Cizeta-Moroder V16T from the early 1990s. The first of its kind was the Cadillac V-16 launched in 1930, a year before the obscure Marmon Sixteen.\n\nRimac had been working on the V-16 for about two years before the unexpected merger with Bugatti. The subsequent Bugatti Rimac company founded in November 2021 is owned by Rimac Group (55 percent) and Porsche (45 percent). Mate Rimac has a 35 percent share in the Rimac Group, followed by Porsche with 22 percent and Hyundai with 11 percent.\n\nThe livestream is scheduled to start at 4 PM ET / 1 PM PST / 10 PM CEST / 8 PM GMT.", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_V-16", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cadillac V-16"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_EB_110", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti EB 110"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_induction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forced induction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Rimac", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cizeta-Moroder_V16T", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cizeta-Moroder V16T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_mid-engine,_rear-wheel-drive_layout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-electric_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-electric range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmon_Motor_Car_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marmon Motor Car Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ZnyqZZ/s3/bugatti-teaser.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The new Hypercar has been presented - in part - in a new video by Mate Rimac, the company's CEO. Crucial new information focuses on the most important aspect: the engine.\n\nWe already know a little bit. It will have 16 cylinders and be naturally aspirated, and now we can add some new pieces to the jigsaw, and they're very interesting indeed.\n\nOne of the questions we had was, will the new Bugatti be electrified, but with what kind of powertrain? The answer is obvious. It will be plug-in. It's the ideal system for providing plenty of extra power, but at a heavier weight. So it could top 2 tonnes, but with plenty of power and torque to spare. Mate Rimac himself explains what the engine of the heir to the Chiron will look like.\n\n\"I thought the right thing to do was to have an internal combustion engine, as exciting as possible, and for me that means a naturally aspirated engine. So no turbo. But not having a turbo means not having the power and torque of the old W16. So how do you go about it? At Rimac, we specialise in electric hypercars. So the idea was to combine the old-school combustion engine with a high-performance electric powertrain. So we have one electric motor at the rear and two at the front, as well as a 25 kWh battery that supplies energy and also enables the car to be driven in 100% electric mode.\n\nThe naturally-aspirated V16 - a behemoth measuring around a metre in length - will therefore be flanked by three electric motors, reminiscent of the Lamborghini Revuelto's layout, but with a much more powerful battery. Rimac hasn't said anything about range or total power, but we're willing to bet that the 'base' Chiron's 1,500 PS will be easily surpassed, and even more so with future special editions. It will be aiming to win the official title of world's fastest car.\n\nIn the short video, Rimac recounts the genesis of the new Bugatti and the meeting with Herbert Diess, then number one of the Volkswagen Group, who said that the heir to the Chiron should be electric. \"You have no experience of hybrids and combustion engines,\" he reportedly told Rimac's founder. Mate reportedly replied, \"I haven't done any of that for the last five years. It now remains to be seen what the Bugatti men have created. Starting with the name.\n\nWe still don't know what the new French hybrid hypercar will be called.

The first product to be rolled out since joining hands with Rimac Automobili, the as-yet-unnamed Bugatti hypercar will (unsurprisingly) be shockingly rapid. As one of its final teasers ahead of the unveil early on June 21, Bugatti Rimac has dropped a video revealing the hypercar's instrument cluster, with the car blazing past the 300 kmph mark and the needle pushing all the way to the other end of the speedo, hinting at the new Bugatti's ability to get incredibly close to the 500 kmph mark.\n\nThe cluster housing appears to be milled out of a block of aluminium, with three gauges set to the left of the speedometer. The speedometer - which also houses the tachometer - has the look of an open-face mechanical watch, with gears and jewels in the background visible through the cluster. In the video, a reading of up to 350 kmph is visible, but the new hypercar appears to accelerate well beyond that mark.\n\nIn a separate video, Bugatti Rimac CEO Mate Rimac confirmed the new Bugatti hypercar will have a hybrid powertrain. In addition to a naturally-aspirated V16 - which replaces the iconic quad-turbo W16 - the new hypercar will also feature three electric motors. The new Bugatti will have two motors up front, and one at the rear, and all of them will draw energy from a 25 kWh battery pack. Rimac also confirmed this car will have the ability to be driven on electric power alone, when needed.\n\nThe Chiron, in Super Sport 300+ form, had clocked a top speed of 490.48 kmph (300 mph) back in 2019, with around 1,600 bhp at its disposal. The new Bugatti hypercar, which is likely to be a fair bit heavier than the Chiron, is expected to have a total power output that far exceeds that of its predecessor.

The Tourbillon boasts a top speed of 276 mph with a Speed Key, advanced electric powertrain, and all-electric range of 37 miles. Design features of the Tourbillon include aerodynamic expertise, analog interior elements, and limited production of only 250 units in 2026.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, we have been hearing multiple reports about Bugatti's next-generation hyper-sport car. We saw multiple teasers of the all-new V16 engine, including one from Mate Rimac himself, and then we had official confirmations on its performance. We even got to see some spy shots of the new Bugatti hypercar. Finally, all of that can be pushed to the back, because the legendary French sports car manufacturer has now unveiled the new Bugatti Tourbillon in full glory.\n\nIn 2004, Bugatti redefined automotive performance with the 1,001-hp Veyron, and then successfully did it again in 2016 with the 1,500 hp Chiron. The Tourbillon is all set to amaze us once again with Bugatti's incredible engineering and beautiful design. Here's what we know so far.\n\n8.3-Liter V16 Hybrid With 1,800 HP Total Power Output\n\nClose\n\nLet's jump right into what makes this car exciting for us. At the heart of the beautiful Tourbillon lies an all-new 8.3-liter naturally-aspirated V16 engine, engineered in collaboration with Cosworth. This powerhouse produces 1,000 hp on its own, but also gets an additional 800 hp from the three electric motors, bringing the total power output to a staggering 1,800 hp. This makes the Tourbillon one of the most powerful hypercars in existence, rivaling the likes of the Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut and the Rimac Nevera.\n\nAccording to the spec sheet, Bugatti claims that the Tourbillon can race from 0-60 in just 2 seconds, and go on to reach a top speed of 276 mph (445km/h) with a Speed Key. Otherwise, top speed is limited to 236 mph (380 km/h)\n\nFun Fact: The Tourbillon is the first Bugatti in more than 20 years not powered by the iconic W16 engine\n\nThe Tourbillon's advanced hybrid powertrain includes a front e-axle with two electric motors and another motor on the rear axle, powered by a 25 kWh oil-cooled 800V battery. This setup not only ensures incredible acceleration and top speed but also offers a usable all-electric range of over 37 miles. The electric powertrain, featuring motors that spin up to 24,000 RPM and a fully integrated dual silicon-carbide inverter, ranks among the most power-dense in the world.\n\nThe Tourbillon will also feature a lightweight construction, and will weigh less than the Chiron, thanks to its innovative use of materials and technology.\n\nBugatti Tourbillon Specs And Features\n\nEngine\n\n8.3-liter naturally aspirated V16\n\nPower\n\n1,000 HP (combustion engine) + 800 HP (electric motors) = 1,800 HP total\n\nElectric Motor\n\n3 (2 on front e-axle, 1 on rear axle)\n\nBattery\n\n25 kWh oil-cooled 800V\n\nAll-Electric Range\n\nOver 60 km / 37 miles\n\nTransmission\n\n8-Speed Longitudinal DCT\n\nTop Speed\n\n380 km/h (236 mph) limited and 445 km/h (276 mph) with Speed Key\n\n0-62mph\n\n2.0 seconds\n\nWeight\n\nLess than 4,400 LBS\n\nChassis\n\nT800 carbon composite\n\nAerodynamic Features\n\nRear wing, advanced diffuser concept, integral crash structures\n\nBrakes\n\nCarboceramic technology, brake-by-wire system\n\nTires\n\nMichelin Pilot Cup Sport 2 (Front: 285/35 R20, Rear: 345/30 R21)\n\nBugatti Tourbillon Design: Form And Function Combined\n\nClose\n\nAs expected, the Bugatti Tourbillon is a beautiful car, and it's also a marvel of aerodynamic engineering. This new, stunning automobile has been designed to maintain perfect balance and thermodynamic efficiency at speeds exceeding 400 km/h (250 mph). The iconic horseshoe grille, the central ridge, and the dual-color split are all highly noticeable and well-thought-out, evolving the traditional Bugatti design elements for modern times. The rear wing, a result of over 20 years of aerodynamic expertise, remains submerged during high-speed runs, contributing to the car's stability and performance.\n\nThe Tourbillon's sleek exterior is not just about aesthetics, because every surface, intake, and vent is perfectly crafted to optimize airflow and cooling. The diffuser concept and integrated crash structures ensure that the car remains beautiful and functional, with advanced aerodynamics playing a crucial role in its performance.\n\n\"The Tourbillon had to be incomparable in every respect. Our philosophy has been to take any single aspect of Chiron and elevate it, looking for elegant and sophisticated engineering solutions and new technologies to deliver a timeless masterpiece. We wanted someone to be able to take any piece of this car, from inside, outside or under the skin, and believe that it could be placed in an art gallery. The result is a car, which is beautiful inside and outside, the most powerful Bugatti to date, which simultaneously elevates mechanical fascination and technical beauty to a whole new level.\"\n\nEmilio Scervo, Bugatti CTO\n\nRelated\n\nBugatti And Rimac's New Hypercar May Feature An Aerodynamic Design Like This Render\n\nThe next Bugatti Rimac hypercar will have a powertrain that's out of this world - this HotCars render speculates on the upcoming design.\n\nBugatti Steps Away From The Norm With Analog Interior\n\nClose\n\nInside the cabin, the Bugatti Tourbillon breaks from the digital trend with a timeless, analog approach. Inspired by horology, the instrument cluster is crafted by Swiss watchmakers and consists of over 600 parts made from titanium and gemstones. This analog cluster is fixed in place, offering an unobstructed view regardless of the steering angle, thanks to a fixed hub steering wheel design.\n\nFun Fact: Bugatti no longer names its core models after legendary racing drivers. Instead, \"Tourbillon\" is a French word, nodding to Bugatti's heritage, and refers to a watchmaking invention by a Swiss-born genius in France in 1801.\n\nThe center console blends crystal glass and aluminum, showcasing the intricate workings of the switches and the engine start lever. This glass undergoes 13 stages of development to ensure clarity and strength, while the aluminum parts are milled from a single block for durability. The only digital screen in the car is hidden until needed, deployed from the center console for essential functions like Apple CarPlay and the reversing camera.\n\nThe seats are placed low in the cabin and feature a lightweight design, with the pedal box adjustable for comfort. Even the audio system is unique, using exciters on the door panels instead of traditional speakers to create a lighter, more efficient setup.\n\nRelated\n\nMinimalistic Luxury: Here's What's Unique About Every Bugatti Interior\n\nBugatti interiors are timeless reflections of luxurious French craftsmanship. There are no screens, just bespoke designs using premium materials.\n\nOnly 250 Units Of The Tourbillon Arrive in 2026\n\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon is set to enter its testing phase, with customer deliveries expected to begin in 2026. Only 250 units will be produced, and the starting price is set at \u20ac3.8 million ($4 million). Hand-assembled at the Bugatti Atelier in Molsheim, the Tourbillon follows the final W16-powered Bugatti models, the Bolide and the W16 Mistral.\n\nThis next-generation hypercar represents the pinnacle of Bugatti's engineering prowess and a bold step into the future of automotive performance, and with a blend of cutting-edge technology, timeless design, and unmatched power, the Tourbillon will undoubtedly become a legend in its own right.", "source": {"uri": "hotcars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotCars"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_solomon@hotcars.com", "name": "Jared Solomon",

The Tourbillon's all-new hybrid powertrain generates 1,800 horsepower, up from 1,500 horsepower in the Chiron, the last model to showcase the W16.\n\nThe $4.1 million Tourbillon, which is currently in the testing phase, can also reach a top speed of 248 mph.\n\nEmilio Scervo, Bugatti's chief technical officer, said choosing a hybrid powertrain over an engine-less design was the \"most important decision\" for his team.\n\n\"We chose the hardest option, creating a powertrain from scratch and pairing it seamlessly with a complex system of e-motors, a new generation eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox and more, all developed from the ground up,\" he said in a press release. \"But it was important to us that this car retain that pure and raw analogue feel of a naturally aspirated combustion engine.\"\n\nBugatti's move to produce a hybrid over an EV mirrors the reversal taking place in the automotive industry. A growing list of automakers are delaying their electrification plans as sales of EVs weaken and demand for hybrids heats up. When Matt Rimac, the founder of electric sports car maker Rimac, merged Bugatti with Rimac in November of 2021, analysts largely expected to see a fully electric Bugatti by the end of the decade. Insiders are now heralding the company's transition to hybrid and expect Bugatti to sell all 250 units of the Tourbillon.\n\n\"I'm delighted that Bugatti chose to make an entirely new engine in a world turning to electric motors,\" Tony Quiroga, editor-in-chief of Car and Driver and co-host of the magazine's \"Into Cars\" podcast, told ABC News. \"That it's powered by an 8.3-liter, V16 that revs to 9000 rpm makes it entirely unique not only today, but in the history of street cars. Bugatti's decision to build an internal-combustion engine that makes less power than its quad-turbocharged predecessor may have been driven by the desire to prioritize engine sound and characteristics over horsepower.\"\n\nPairing an electric motor to a gas-powered engine is becoming more common among automakers; the latest examples include the Corvette E-Ray, McLaren Artura and Ferrari SF90 Stradale. Bugatti, however, is the sole automaker to offer a 16-cylinder hybrid powertrain. Adding electric motors to an internal combustion engine -- hypercar or not -- maximizes performance and can produce eye-popping horsepower. Drivers get instantaneous torque without spewing too many noxious gases. For a Bugatti Tourbillon owner, there's not much to dislike.\n\n\"You get the efficiency gain of a turbo but with the low-end throttle response of a larger engine, an appreciable performance step,\" Larry Webster, senior vice president of media and editorial at Hagerty, told ABC News. \"From an enthusiast perspective, this is a great application of electrification and a trend I think we'll see continue.\"\n\nHe added, \"Electrification has opened up entirely new ways for engineers to squeeze more power into the same amount of space. The horsepower war is in full swing and shows no sign of abating.\"\n\nThe Tourbillon's 8.3-liter engine makes 1,000 horsepower and the car's three electric motors produce another 800. The car, including the added weight of the large battery pack and its electrically actuated dihedral doors, still weighs less than the Chiron, which the company attributes to the lightweight materials used in the engine and chassis.\n\nThe electric motors -- two in the front, one at the rear axle -- are powered by a 25 kWh 800V battery that's stationed behind the driver and passenger. The car can travel more than 37 miles on electric power alone.\n\nThe interior of the Tourbillon has been totally redesigned as well. There is now a small touchscreen that can display vehicle data and Apple CarPlay. There's also the option of keeping it entirely hidden; a mechanism deploys the screen if the driver so chooses.\n\nThe instrument cluster was built by Swiss watchmakers and contains more than 600 parts, titanium and gemstones such as ruby and sapphire. Bugatti's designers reworked the interior to be more spacious, \"making it ideal for longer trips and daily use,\" according to the company. There's even a frunk -- a front trunk -- now for extra storage space.\n\n\"It is crazy to build a new V16 engine, to integrate with a new battery pack and electric motors and to have a real Swiss-made watchmaker instrument cluster and 3D-printed suspension parts ... but this is what Ettore [Bugatti] would have done,\" said Rimac.\n\nAn electric Bugatti may be coming one day, but for now, a hybrid Tourbillon still satisfies the needs of the uber wealthy who can afford it, Webster said.\n\n\"I certainly never thought we needed all-electric sports cars for maximum performance and pleasure,\" he said. \"An internal combustion engine is a major contributor to the personality of the car thanks to the sound, the throttle response, and the motive power.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com",

The reorganization at the time was seen as evidence that the French brand's large internal combustion engine cars lacked a critical role at VW, since VW's strategy focuses on producing EVs.\n\nEarlier this year, the Chiron's production run of 500 ended with the release of the $3.9 million Chiron Super Sport; the final W16-powered Bugatti models, the Bolide and W16 Mistral, begin deliveries later this year.\n\nThe \u20ac3.8 million ($4.1 million) Tourbillon coupe pairs a naturally aspirated V-16 powertrain with two electric motors placed in the front and one electric motor placed at the rear axle. The 1,800-horsepower hybrid power plant, a first at the 115-year-old company, was developed specifically for the Tourbillon, which can hit a top speed of 445 kph (276 mph), according to the French automaker.\n\n\"The Bugatti brand is about heritage, about craftsmanship, about artisan work, [and] a combustion engine very much still fits within the picture,\" Bugatti Chief Executive Officer Mate Rimac told Bloomberg TV. \"We felt like people still want that craftsmanship of the combustion engine.\"\n\nIn press remarks about the vehicle, Bugatti Chief Technology Officer Emilio Scervo characterized the Tourbillon's hybrid development as the \"hardest possible option.\" There's a new eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox and a 37-mile range of all-electric driving; the powerplant reduces emissions by 70% compared to its predecessor.\n\nThe new all-wheel-drive supercar bests the performance of its 1,500-horsepower predecessor, the $2.6 million Chiron, and will compete with such electric hypercars as the $2 million Rimac Nevera and $2.2 million Automobili Pininfarina Battista. Ferrari, another potential competitor, unveiled its first-ever hybrid, the SF90 Stradale, in 2019, with special variants costing nearly $1 million.\n\nBut the cabin of the Bugatti is far more opulent than those.\n\nAt the center of the steering wheel, Swiss watchmakers created an intricate three-gauge instrument cluster with the look of a high-end wristwatch. \"Tourbillon\" is the French word for whirlwind; in mechanical watchmaking, a tourbillon is a mechanism that rotates components inside the watch to increase accuracy.\n\nMade from titanium, sapphire and ruby, the skeletonized gauges remain fixed in place as the steering wheel rotates around them in a fitting embodiment of the car's name. Bugatti did not comment on which watchmaker completed the work.\n\nDespite the modern aesthetics of the car and the advanced motors under its hood, its interior looks analogue. The center console between the two seats blends crystal glass and aluminum to showcase control knobs and switches set along a vertical column. In a nod to the ignition setup in original Bugattis, drivers will have to pull or push a lever to start and stop.\n\nThe only screen inside the cabin, which displays Apple CarPlay and vehicle data, remains hidden unless requested by deploying it from the top of the center console. It extends to full landscape mode in five seconds.\n\nOutside the vehicle, the body is characterized along its sides by the signature horseshoe shape that has defined both modern Bugattis and vintage Bugattis such as the Type 57SC Atlantic. The Tourbillon looks leaner than the Chiron, with a hidden rear wing that acts as an airbrake for improved stability under deceleration. Also, unlike the Chiron, the Tourbillon has two dihedral doors that allow for easy entry at the push of a button.\n\nBugatti executives did not specify whether they would use a version of the Tourbillon to attempt a new top-speed record, a title Bugatti has held at various times in the past. A total of 250 examples will be built. Deliveries will begin in 2026.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coupe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watchmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Nevera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Nevera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_SF90_Stradale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari SF90 Stradale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Boasting a combined power of 1800 horsepower and a starting price of $3.9 million, this vehicle redefines luxury and performance.\n\nThe Tourbillon is not just an evolution of the well-known Chiron; it is an entirely new model. From its monocoque chassis to its V-16 hybrid powertrain, everything has been designed from scratch. The internal combustion engine is an 8.3-liter beast, developed in collaboration with Cosworth, delivering 1000 horsepower without the need for turbocharging. This engine is complemented by a hybrid system that includes two electric motors on the front axle and one on the rear, adding an additional 800 horsepower.\n\nThe performance of the Tourbillon is astounding. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.0 seconds and can reach a top speed of 444 km/h using a special key called the Speed Key. Additionally, thanks to its 25 kWh battery and an 800-volt electrical system, the Tourbillon can travel up to 60 kilometers in full electric mode, a remarkable figure for a hypercar of this caliber.\n\nThe design of the Tourbillon also deserves special mention. Its electric dihedral doors and an analog interior featuring dials designed by Swiss watchmakers give it a classic sophistication. Unlike many modern cars, the Tourbillon eschews visible digital screens, opting for a more timeless appearance.\n\nBugatti CEO Mate Rimac explained that the development of the Tourbillon was guided by the brand's rich 115-year history and the maxims of Ettore Bugatti: \"If it is comparable, it is no longer Bugatti\" and \"Nothing is too beautiful\". According to Rimac, the goal was to create a vehicle that fused the tradition of combustion engines with the advantages of electric technology while maintaining the essence of Bugatti.\n\nThe Tourbillon will be limited to 250 units, and demand has already exceeded expectations, with most units reserved before its official presentation. This vehicle not only represents a significant technological advancement but also pays homage to Bugatti's rich heritage, combining traditional craftsmanship with modern innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, the Bugatti Tourbillon 2026 is more than just a car; it is a statement of intent from the brand, a masterpiece of engineering that sets new standards in the automotive industry. With its launch scheduled for 2026, Bugatti continues its legacy of unmatched excellence and luxury.", "source": {"uri": "cubaheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CubaHeadlines"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocoque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monocoque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watchmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Bugatti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ettore Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electrical_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electrical Engineering", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn0.celebritax.com/sites/default/files/styles/watermark_100/public/1718918505-bugatti-tourbillon-2026-nuevo-hiperauto-hibrido-1800-hp-precio-39-millones-dolares.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

It's called the Tourbillon, so-named in the spirit of ultra-high-end watches, as Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac explained during the car's reveal. Eight years after the French automaker first began production of the Chiron, the Tourbillon marks a new era for the automaker, as its first hybrid flagship.\n\nIf you've seen its predecessors, you shouldn't be too surprised by the exterior design of the Tourbillon: It basically evokes a Chiron, but smoother, with a more arrow-like, pointed nose, and more curves overall. That classic Bugatti \"arc\" that cuts along the bottom edge of the door, up and around the side window, has been relaxed, and isn't quite as circular as before. The engine cover is only shrouded in the loosest sense by a thin bridge that reaches from the rear deck up to the roof. Overall, the body is 33 millimeters shorter than the Chiron.\n\nBugatti Design Director Frank Heyl explained the rationale behind the Tourbillon's pointed front end at the reveal, saying that Bugatti's previous record-setting hypercars taught the firm that \"if you reduce frontal area, it has a greater influence on the speed of the vehicle [than] anything else.\" Still, the classic Bugatti horseshoe grille is wider than ever before, and more accentuated by the rake at the front.\n\nThe Tourbillon's interior is defined by mechanical, analog action, and the only screen of significance on the dash is very tiny -- in fact, it wasn't present in the renders shown during the car's reveal. But the steering wheel is the real party piece -- it reaches around the instrument cluster, so that the gorgeous, watch-inspired gauges are visible through the inside of the rim, as the rim rotates around it. Overall, think Spyker's old aero-deco motif, but amped up to new heights.\n\nThe Tourbillon is powered by an 8.3-liter, naturally aspirated V16 that can rev up to 9,000 rpm and develops 1,000 horsepower all by itself. Aided by three electric motors, the powertrain churns 1,800 horsepower in total. As it's not a W16, like the Chiron and Veyron previously had, the design of the internal combustion engine is more traditional -- two banks of eight cylinders a side, rather than the W16's layout, which was more like a pair of V8s sharing a 90-degree crankshaft. This setup also makes the new V16 about 10 inches longer than the old W16.\n\nOf course, the W16 also had four turbochargers, while the new engine is free-breathing. Rimac says the driver will have full control over which aspects of the powertrain they want to use, whether that's ICE only, battery power only, or the full grunt of the total package. In the latter mode, the Tourbillon can go from a standstill to 62 mph in a reported two seconds flat. Unfortunately for those keeping score, we don't have a projected top speed yet.\n\nEven with the longer engine, the Tourbillon's wheelbase measures a mere 2.9 millimeters longer than the Chiron's, and its overall curb weight is somehow less as well. No exact numbers were given, as Rimac says that engineers are still pinning down the final numbers, but the CEO said it's the first time a pure-ICE vehicle's hybrid replacement weighs less than its gas-only predecessor. Count on Bugatti to pull off the unthinkable. Deliveries will begin in 2026, and the company plans to make 250 examples.", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_ismail@thedrive.com", "name": "Adam Ismail", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molsheim", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cylinder (engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "V8 engine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mechanical Engineering", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BUGATTI-World-Premiere-Presskit-Images-20-copy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Two days before the big reveal, Bugatti announced a YouTube docuseries covering the process of creating the new model. Bugatti rarely introduces new cars and has been dropping information about the new model since the Chiron, the previous hypercar, ended its production.\n\nShortly after Bugatti heralded that L'Ultime, the last Chiron Super Sport, had left the factory, the iconic French luxury and performance carmaker began teasing its next, as yet unnamed, hypercar creation. L'Ultime was the 5ooth car of the limited edition that debuted in 2016, and because Bugatti hand assembles all of its cars and controls who will buy them, the famed auto firm wasn't surprised by the end of the run. We can surmise that the design and engineering started on the next car at least a year or more ago.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIn the first episode of the docuseries, titled Bugatti -- A New Era: Concept & Vision, Mate Rimac, CEO of Bugatti Rimac, talks about his work persuading the top management of Bugatti's parent company, Volkswagen Group, to give its blessing to the new project. A significant part of his challenge involved his choice of the new car's powertrain. When you watch this short video, you may be surprised.\n\nBUGATTI - A New Era: Concept & Vision\n\nRimac also referred to other challenges in conceiving, developing, and creating a vehicle sure to be an icon true to founder Ettore Bugatti's vision for the company, that it follows the paths to the perfection of design, engineering, performance, and beauty. The sense of duty and responsibility to the company founder and the brand today is palpable in the short video. Rimac captures the sense of mission as the video opens when he says, borrowing a bit from Isaac Newton, \"Bugatti is created by extraordinary people. We are standing on the shoulders of giants.\"\n\nRelated L'Ultime: The last 300 mph Bugatti Chiron Super Sport Bugatti's next hypercar will feature a V16 engine What we know so far about the new Bugatti hypercar\n\nWe don't know a lot about the next Bugatti hypercar. We know its creators wanted to adhere to the principle of perfection. The Chiron was the first production car to drive faster than 300 mph. Performance will certainly be an important element, although it's hard to imagine the numbers getting much higher than the Chiron's 1,480 horsepower. We can tell from the video that the powertrain will include a Bugatti V16 gas engine and multiple electric motors. So far, just the prospect of all that power in a street-legal car is enough to consider until June 20.\n\nThe fastest and best way to see the new Bugatti when the news breaks is to tune in to the Bugatti YouTube channel on Thursday, June 20 at 4 PM EST or 1 PM PST.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Bugatti teases its next hypercar before the June 20 reveal Bugatti Bolide: A track-only hypercar for drivers with no racing experience Honda unveils two new 'Honda 0' EV concepts", "source": {"uri": "themanual.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manual"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruce_brown@themanual.com", "name": "Bruce Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Rimac", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Bugatti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ettore Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Bolide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Bolide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street-legal_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Street-legal vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Mate-Rimac-Bugatti-Rimac-CEO-holding-a-model-he-used-to-get-the-go-ahead-for-his-vision-of-a-new-hypercar.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 32, "textEnd": 39, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The brand has consistently been a pioneer in the hypercar space and the new Bugatti Tourbillon is no different to the Veyron and Chiron in that it represents a huge leap forward for this most exotic of automotive genres, in pretty much every department.\n\nOnce again this is a car defined by numbers, but the means by which they are achieved is very different to before, and arguably even more impressive. Gone is the W16 engine, but Bugatti has never been disposed to downsizing and that venerable unit is replaced by an all-new, naturally aspirated V16. For good measure, it's assisted by a sizeable hybrid module made up of three electric motors and a 25kWh battery pack. Peak combined power is a dizzying 1,774bhp, with Bugatti confirming the Tourbillon will also come with a 37-mile electric range.\n\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon's V16 engine has been developed in collaboration with British engine wizards Cosworth, and by the time the Tourbillon reaches production in 2026 it will be the first production car to feature a V16 engine in over 85 years. At 8.3-litres in capacity, this is a formidable powerplant able on its own to produce 987bhp - the same output as the original Bugatti Veyron which had the assistance of a quad turbocharger layout.\n\nConnected to this engine are three electric motors that leverage the technical prowess of electric supercar maker Rimac following its integration with Bugatti in the VW Group stable. The first motor is sandwiched between the petrol engine and transmission, with the other two powering the purely electrified front axle in a similar fashion to the latest Lamborghini Revuelto. Without a physical connection between the combustion engine and front axle, Bugatti has been able to use the free space inside the car's central tunnel to house the 25kWh battery pack and many of its electronics.", "source": {"uri": "autoexpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Auto Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-electric_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-electric range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Revuelto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini Revuelto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petrol engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vacuum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-terrain vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional_Exams", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Professional Exams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media.autoexpress.co.uk/image/private/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1718883081/autoexpress/2024/06/Bugatti Tourbillon 2024-12.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It has the same number of cylinders as its Chiron and Veyron predecessors, but ditches the quad-turbo setup for natural aspiration and gains a hybrid system with three electric motors.\n\nHooked up to a 25 kWh battery and an 800-volt architecture, these motors alone produce 600 kW (800 horsepower). They can be used to drive more than 37 miles on electricity alone. Or, they can be combined with the engine for a total output of 1,800 horsepower. That might mean the engine is down considerably on the 1,600hp power plant of the Chiron Super Sport, which T3 drove a couple of years ago, but the total output of the hybrid Tourbillon makes it the most powerful Bugatti yet.\n\nBugatti says the all-wheel-drive Tourbillon can sprint to 62 mph (100km/h) in 2.0 seconds, pass 124 mph (200 km/h) in under five seconds, and reach 186 mph (300 km/h) in less than 10 seconds. The latter is more than two seconds quicker than the Chiron Super Sport. Top speed is limited to 236 mph, unless the driver pulls over and inserts the famous Bugatti 'speed key'. This removes the limiter and allows the Tourbillon to reach 276 mph.\n\nDespite its enormous engine and hybrid system, Bugatti says the Tourbillon weighs under 1,995 kg, while maximum torque is 900 Nm, or 665 ft-lbs. The engine is attached to an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission with electronic limited-slip differential, and Bugatti says the two front motors enable full torque vectoring, where their output is shuffled between the front wheels depending on which has the most grip.\n\nSpeaking about the new car, Bugatti boss Rimac said: \"It is crazy to build a new V16 engine, to integrate with a new battery pack and electric motors and to have a real Swiss-made watchmaker instrument cluster and 3D- printed suspension parts and a crystal glass centre console. But it is what [Bugatti founder] Ettore would have done, and it is what makes a Bugatti incomparable and timeless.\"\n\nAs watch fans will know, Tourbillon is a word used to describe a fantastically complicated (and often equally expensive) watch movement. Invented by French horologist Abraham-Louis Breguet in 1795, its major components spin in a cage in a bid to offset the pull of gravity, which can otherwise interfere with the delicate components of a watch movement, causing it to fall out of time.\n\nBugatti is using the name because its new Tourbillon ditches digital displays in favour of an analogue instrument cluster, designed and built with the expertise of Swiss watchmakers. Comprising more than 600 parts, it is constructed from titanium and features gemstones like sapphires and rubies, just like the intricate movement of a Swiss watch.\n\nBugatti says: \"The skeletonised cluster is built to the largest tolerance of 50 microns, with the smallest at five microns [0.005 mm], and weighs just 700g. This intricately engineered masterpiece remains a focal point of the driving experience, fixed in place as the rim of the steering wheel rotates around it - a set-up known as a fixed hub steering wheel. Through this ingenious concept Tourbillon drivers have an unobstructed view of their instrumentation independent of the steering angle because the spokes reach around the back of the instrument cluster.\"\n\nA similar approach has been applied to the centre console, which also lacks any form of touchscreen infotainment - at least at first glance. The console is made from crystal glass and aluminium, and houses switchgear similar to that of the Chiron, where rotating dials house digital displays showing media volume and cabin temperature. A small display for vehicle data and Apple CarPlay deploys from the dashboard only when the driver needs it, then switches to a portrait orientation to show a parking camera feed when reverse is selected.\n\nEmilio Scervo, Bugatti chief technical officer, said: \"The Tourbillon had to be incomparable in every respect...Ultimately, we chose the hardest possible option, creating a powertrain from scratch and pairing it seamlessly with a complex system of e-motors, a new generation eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox and more, all developed from the ground up specifically for the Tourbillon.\n\nBuagtti says it plans to hand-build just 250 examples of the Tourbillon.

With his Tourbillon glowering menacingly in the background, soaked in smoke, the director of design for Bugatti Rimac name-checks, of course, Ettore Bugatti, who founded his eponymous company more than 115 years ago.\n\nThen there's Romano Artioli, who in the '90s resurrected the mothballed marque with the EB 110. Lastly Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, who after another short nap awoke the Bugatti spirit once again, exhilarating the world with the company's third swing at existence with the landmark Veyron.\n\nLike the McLaren F1 and the LaFerrari, the tectonic shocks the Veyron quaked the automotive landscape with in 2006 cannot be overstated -- the first production car ever to breach four-figure horsepower and surpass 250 mph. All thanks to its simply ludicrous W16 engine, outfitted with no less than four turbochargers and 10 radiators.\n\nThen of course came its successor, the Chiron, a decade later. Updating its landmark W16 powerplant, the Chiron succeeded even further with its sleek visual makeover. While the Veyron suffered slings due to its computer mouse-like profile and simplistic styling, the Veyron stretched, tweaked, pulled and cut the sheet metal to sculpt a hypercar worthy of its absurd metrics.\n\nAnd now, the Tourbillon. Unlike the Veyron, the Tourbillon is not an evolution of its forebears but rather a sui generis species. A clean sheet imagination that doesn't share a single carryover part from anything Bugatti has built before. Not a single window button, gasket or patch of carbon fiber.\n\nPhysically, anyway. Spiritually the Tourbillon is a thoroughly inspired m\u00e9lange of a trilogy of models from the French marque's lore -- there's the performance inspiration from the Type 35 race car, the opulence from the Type 41 Royale and the pinnacle of grace and elegance from the Type 57 SC Atlantic, from which Bugatti's 16-cylinder bloodline was born.\n\nBut unlike its modern predecessors, the Tourbillon doesn't sport a W16 -- essentially twin V8s merged. Instead the Tourbillon opts for a totally new, designed-from-the-ground-up V16: a mammoth, naturally aspirated 8.3-liter volcano unlike anything this planet has ever seen.\n\n\"If it is comparable,\" Heyl grins, echoing a famous Ettore Bugatti quote, \"then it is no longer a Bugatti.\"\n\nAs of press time there were few details to share of this powerplant, other than it was developed in partnership with Cosworth. The vehicle was still so secret when Bugatti granted us permission to photograph it deep in the bowels of a guarded Long Beach, California, studio that they wouldn't even tell us the Chiron successor's name. The model was still only referred to as simply the \"Hybrid,\" as Bugatti promised the vehicle would marry electric power to whatever combustion engine they developed.\n\nWhat we do know is the massive 64-valve powerplant will eschew any and all forced induction, unlike its W16 predecessor that boasted no fewer than four turbos. A 24.8-kWh battery pack will power a trio of electric motors, one on each front wheel and a third on the rear axle. The holistic concept being the instant twist of the electric motors will provide torque fill until the massive 1,000-horse tsunami of power cascades from the high-revving combustion engine, overall boasting a combined 1,800-horsepower with a 9,000-rpm ceiling. Outlets are reporting 0-62 mph clicks in about two seconds, 124-mph eclipsed in less than five and 249-mph reached in under 25 seconds -- a full seven seconds faster than the Chiron. All on the way to an electronically limited 277-mph top speed. Simply bonkers.\n\nThe fact they were able to fit this huge motor -- more than 39 inches long, making it some 16 inches longer than its W16 predecessor -- in a package barely an inch longer than the Chiron is a testament to the blue sky design of the Tourbillon. The overall weight is the same as well, a miraculous achievement when you consider the addition of a 400-plus pound battery pack and electric motors.\n\nPackaging and weight solutions were accomplished by brilliant innovations, like fixing the seat placement (the pedals and steering wheel adjust instead) and using lightweight organic-looking 3D-printed parts (like suspension sourced from Czinger/Divergent). In place of audio speakers, for instance, the Tourbillon will debut tech that actuates the door panel membrane for sound, essentially transforming them into speakers. For superior aero and center of gravity, engineers submerged the cabin an inch and a quarter lower into the new monocoque, reducing its critical frontal area.\n\nThere's even more storage space, including a custom piece of luggage for the frunk. The odd-shaped suitcase doubles as a secret wink to other owners, a badge of honor identifying you as a Bugatti driver as you stroll through the Belmond hotel lobby.\n\n\"That's why it's such a beauty to have a clean sheet of paper approach,\" notes Mate Rimac, chief executive officer of Bugatti Rimac. \"You can do these things off the white page as you interact.\"\n\nBut it's not just the white sheet design; the small size of Bugatti's development team grants the rare ability to work together intimately and rapidly, with greater creative agility than massive companies. Rimac credits this symbiotic dynamic for the otherworldly results.\n\n\"We're super happy, comfortable and proud that we can call it a development team; it's not like there's an engineering team and separate designers,\" Rimac reveals. \"Through and through we are one developing this thing, and you can see that on the car.\"\n\n\"It's not like Mate says, 'I want a 16 cylinder,' he creates a package and then throws it over the fence and I put a nice candy wrapper around it,\" Heyl adds. \"That's not how it works. We work as one team.\"\n\nAnother luxury that other OEMs cannot boast is shedding the anchor-like burden of the bottom line. The only way to go about creating such a singular, no-holds-barred, revolutionary, budget-be-damned unicorn under a corporate roof is to lose the suits. You know, the guys who shoehorn a love story into an otherwise great sci-fi movie because a certain test market demo thought the movie could use more romance. It's the same reason Guns N' Roses locked out every label goon from the studio when they recorded Appetite for Destruction. Bean counters could ruin any and every human attempt at magnificence.\n\n\"So with all these crazy things you see in the car, somebody at some point says, 'Guys, you cannot do that, it's too expensive. Dial it back a little bit,'\" Rimac shares, the relatively green leader of the legendary heritage automaker seeming almost unaware that as CEO, that bottom line responsibility falls entirely on his shoulders. \"And what I'm most proud of in this project is that we didn't dial it back anywhere -- you can see that it's full throttle, everywhere.\"\n\nOnly a marque as svelte as Bugatti could get away with such hijinks in the modern world. We're talking the rarefied air of the Koenigseggs, Czingers, Paganis and Singers of the world. The atypical company where the quality of the final product out-prioritizes the sobering bottom line of Excel spreadsheets.\n\nMost vehicles are evolutions of a model, modulations of a preexisting segment. For a vehicle to mutate into its own species altogether is an occurrence more rare than discovering a new tribe of Homo sapiens. The Bugatti Tourbillon boasts not just one such quantum leap in biology but two. Allow that to wash around in your brain for a second.\n\nFor while the V16 might get the petrol heads foaming at the mouth, it's arguably what's inside that matters most. To ensure the ultra-luxury car's interior was not outshone by its watershed engine, the Bugatti team crafted the cabin to physically manifest the amaranthine art of watchmaking. The shock in first seeing the Tourbillon cabin cannot be overstated, with an analog complexity that's difficult to articulate.\n\nImagine a skeleton watch, with all its intricate detail and wonderment of engineering, exercised across the interior. Embodied in the titanium-machined instrument cluster, the gauges resemble an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak open-worked under glass, so the speedometer needle climbs while tiny gears synchronize behind real sapphire glass. It's as if \"the Arte dell'Orologeria invades the interior,\" as Heyl likes to say. Even the battery charge gauge is mechanical, making the Bugatti the only car in the world that delivers electric power data via analog needle.\n\nIt's not just immensely complicated for the sake of vapid showmanship. Rather like the transilience in horology that was the tourbillion advancement -- one invented to mitigate the effects of gravitational pull -- Bugatti's version aims to not only divorce itself from the laws of physics, but from time itself.\n\nThe folks at Ch\u00e2teau Saint Jean are so keen on showing off this revelation that they designed a spokeless steering wheel. Also machined from titanium, the fixed hub wheel bequeaths the driver a completely unobstructed view of these chronograph gauges, no matter what angle the steering is dialed. The consequence of this entire Herculean endeavor is that the Tourbillon is bereft of any digital display (well, nearly -- a small phone-size screen automatically retracts for the backup camera and can be button activated for other uses).\n\nIn a universe where ultraluxe and hypercar models are increasingly battling for supremacy via number, size, brightness and resolution of digital screens, the sight of their complete absence astonishes like a blow to the head.\n\nThe reason for this dearth is simple. iPhones are updated yearly, rendering these technological baubles obsolete in a couple hundred days. Bugattis can never be rendered obsolete; they aim to be relevant for a couple hundred years. Literally. Like a Patek Philippe chronograph, as they say you never actually own a Bugatti, you merely look after it for the next generation.\n\nConsider this year the French marque celebrates the 100th anniversary of the legendary Type 35. These record-shattering race cars are still being run hard at events like the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion, they're not tucked away in some garage under glass. \"It's without overexaggeration I say we're making these cars for a hundred years plus,\" Heyl argues. \"They still need to be relevant in 50 years' time when they drive onto a Pebble Beach Concours in 2074.\"\n\nTaken in totality, Bugatti's latest magnum opus could be interpreted as work of extreme hubris, the type of action that could kill a legacy brand in one fell swoop. While the entire automotive landscape prepares for a seemingly inevitable all-electric future, killing large displacement combustion engines while sunsetting their entire V12 lineages, here is Bugatti building the 21st century's first and only V16 powerplant -- a naturally aspirated 8.3-liter leviathan at that. And while other manufacturers trip over themselves stuffing their cabins with ever more digital screens the width of the Mississippi, here comes Bugatti eliminating displays entirely, replacing them with Swiss-made chronographs.\n\nThe mind boggles at the audacity, the arrogance, the courage. Because these are also the decisions that, if executed properly, can open the door to create something of timeless importance. Something truly permanent, something that will be remembered for as long as man goes Vrrrroooom! -- be that on the racetrack, highway or mind's eye.\n\nWhen this risk paradox is mentioned to the young CEO, he pauses for a moment, shrugs. \"I don't know,\" Rimac considers. \"I guess I tend to surprise people sometimes.\"", "source": {"uri": "maxim.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maxim"},

The new model is called Tourbillon -- an obvious allusion to handmade mechanical watches, which are a major inspiration for this vehicle, especially its interior.\n\nJust 250 Bugatti Tourbillons will be built, with deliveries starting in 2026.\n\n\"We like to say that this project is standing on the shoulders of giants,\" Bugatti director of design Frank Heyl told Road & Track at a private, exclusive preview of the car in Los Angeles in March. Another way to phrase that sentiment? The expectations here are giant. How do you improve upon a car like the 304.77-mph Chiron -- Bugatti's flagship since 2016 -- and the Chiron's progenitor, the Veyron, which first appeared in 2004 with a then-astounding 1000 hp?\n\nUntil we drive the new Tourbillon, we can only surmise that it will live up to its hype. But, judging from our early viewing and exclusive interviews with Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac and design chief Heyl, we can say that the prospects are looking spectacular.\n\nMeet the Bugatti Tourbillon\n\nOn the surface, the new car is what we expected, given the historic marriage between Bugatti and Croatian upstart Rimac Automobili that occurred back in 2021. This marriage pairs the fabled French brand known for highly complex internal-combustion engines of extraordinary power with the most forward-thinking electric-propulsion engineers working today.\n\nUnder Mate Rimac's leadership, the new Bugatti was expected to employ a hybrid-electric-and-combustion powertrain with enough boost to blast the car to Mars. The Tourbillon features not the iconic W-16 that has been the heart and soul of Bugatti for some 20 years, but an all-new 8.3-liter V-16 mounted amidships combined with three electric motors totaling 1800 hp. While the new car clearly uses Bugatti's design language, there's plenty new here. Styling is subjective, but speed is not; the Tourbillon's projected numbers are extreme.\n\n\"It's now 20 years that we are doing these high-speed programs,\" Heyl says. \"Starting with the Veyron and later the Veyron Super Sport -- and all the experience that we've gained in making the Chiron Super Sport+ go beyond 300 mph -- is now the foundation of this new car.\"\n\nThe designers and engineers understand the challenge at hand. To succeed the Chiron, the new Bugatti must fire on all cylinders, literally and figuratively; it must transcend expectations to be a success. \"The guiding principles of how we even start conceptualizing such a car and the design ethos behind it is the aspect of timelessness,\" says Heyl. \"These cars will be enjoyed by automobile connoisseurs centuries from now.\"\n\nThe Tourbillon's Design\n\nFrom a macro point of view, the goal with the Tourbillon was to reimagine the Chiron with a more slippery, svelte body, while also reengineering its guts to include an even bigger engine along with a proprietary electric powertrain with three motors and a great big battery swimming in a vat of cooling liquid, plus inverters and everything else needed to make that function... without turning this vehicle into a behemoth. It is meant to be the apotheosis of a fast touring car -- and the opposite of an SUV.\n\n\"Beauty comes from the aesthetic of purpose,\" Heyl says. \"And the purpose here is performance. Therefore, form follows performance... the car looks like it does because it functions like it functions. There is no styling for the sake of styling. The shapes almost fall into place automatically because of their function. It's through this design principle that allows us to create shapes that are tailor-made to their purpose and tie into the stylistic DNA of the brand. That way they become authentic. And only a car that is authentic can be timeless.\"\n\nThere are myriad examples of this form-follows-function ideology. The whole rear underside of the car has become a diffuser with an integrated crash structure. The seats are fixed to the floor to keep their lower profile and light weight, while the pedal box is adjustable. The interior sits an inch and a quarter lower than the Chiron's so that the facial surface area could be lessened to allow for better aerodynamics. The \"flying fenders\" direct airflow under the streamlined headlights to direct the wind into the engine intakes to increase airflow since there's no turbocharging. The car is now so low, dihedral doors had to be cut into the roof; at the same time, they add a wow factor to the overall package. The list of remarkable attributes goes on and on.\n\n\"The suspension is completely 3D printed,\" Mate Rimac says, \"with shapes that you couldn't manufacture in any other way.\"\n\nThe car's overall shape is strikingly unique -- yet clearly Bugatti. The center spine draws from the Type 57 SC Atlantic of the 1930s, one of the most beautiful cars ever made. The familiar horseshoe is present on the car's nose. The influence of the Veyron and Chiron are the most apparent, but inspiration comes from other places as well.\n\n\"For example, here in nature,\" says Heyl. \"If we observe the [peregrine] falcon, the fastest animal on the planet, there's a lot to learn about aerodynamics. There is nothing that has a greater influence of the speed buildup beyond 200 mph than frontal area. And this is what we can observe on the falcon. What does it do if it nosedives for its prey? It tucks under its wings. Why? To reduce frontal area, to pick up speed.\"\n\nThe Tourbillon was designed to do the same. A single glance and you can see that the frontal profile, compared to the Chiron, has been reduced. The result is a car that looks ready to pounce on its prey.\n\nThe Tourbillon's Powertrain\n\nLike the Chiron, the Tourbillon's power turns all four wheels, but it does so in an entirely reimagined way. Unlike the Chiron and its four turbos, the new car has none. While the wheelbase has increased to make room for the battery pack, electric motors, and longer engine, it's grown by only 29 mm -- an amazing accomplishment given that the new ICE's crankshaft is over three feet long. And the company claims the new hybrid Tourbillon will weigh less than the Chiron.\n\n\"Basically,\" Rimac says, \"we wanted to have a very high-performance but also a very analog kind of old-school engine. Naturally aspirated. In order to do that, we needed an understanding of how far you could push the electric powertrain. We know you can have a very high-performance electric system that enhances the combustion engine so we don't need to turbocharge.\"\n\nTo make room for the battery pack, the transmission was moved from between the seats, as in the Chiron, to the back of the car. \"The battery is narrower than the Chiron's gearbox so you can push the passengers closer,\" Rimac explains. \"Still comfortable. However, the cabin is more narrow, like Frank said, like a falcon tucking its wings and reducing frontal area.\"\n\nDuring the presentation, the Bugatti executives played a recording of the V-16 blasting through its eight gears while revving on a dyno. It's certainly enough to get the engine in your chest pumping and your check-writing hand warmed up, but for the technocrats, the e-power is equally as exciting. The 25-kWh, oil-cooled 800-volt battery and three motors allow for a claimed fully electric range of 37 miles.\n\n\"All of this was developed specifically for this car,\" says Rimac. Normally, he explains, the design process requires two disciplines: interior and exterior. But Bugatti added a third design discipline for the rolling chassis. \"For us,\" Rimac says, \"it was so important that the car was very beautiful, even what we call the naked form or the rolling chassis. Every part, from a brake caliper to a suspension arm or some kind of bracket, has to be a piece of art. Even if the customer doesn't see it.\"\n\nRimac runs through the numbers with me: Horsepower rises from the standard Chiron's 1500 to 1800; according to the simulation tests and all the data thus far available, zero to 60 mph will go from 2.4 seconds down to 2.0 seconds flat. The zero-to-300-km/h (186-mph) sprint will fall from 13 to 10 seconds. Zero to 250 mph goes from 32 to 25 seconds.\n\nThe Tourbillon's Interior\n\nFans of hypercars hear the term \"race car for the road\" all the time. Bugatti has no such ambitions. The goal with the Tourbillon was to set a new standard for luxury and artistic design, not to build a race-car cockpit. The designers and engineers like to joke that all the employees -- even the janitors at the factory -- get to own Bugattis, the way Ford employees might own Rangers and Explorers. Of course, that can't be the case, given the rarity and expense. So the executives looked to owners for inspiration.\n\n\"This is where the art of watchmaking comes into play,\" says Heyl. \"Our research has shown that our customers are really into mechanical watches.\" Thus the driver interface was so inspired. The word \"tourbillon,\" according to the dictionary, means \"a frame for the escapement of a timepiece, especially a watch, geared to the going train in such a way as to rotate the escapement about once a minute in order to minimize positional error.\"\n\nThe new Bugatti's instrument cluster was designed and built with the help of Swiss watchmakers and is instantly recognizable as a reimagining of the finest timepiece that would sit on a Bugatti owner's wrist. According to Bugatti, the instrument cluster is \"made up of more than 600 parts and constructed from titanium as well as gemstones such as sapphire and ruby, [and] the skeletonized cluster is built to the largest tolerance of 50 microns, with the smallest at 5 microns, and weighs just 700 g.\" You can imagine how long it took to write that sentence, let alone design and build this cluster.\n\nThe center console is a blend of polished aluminum and crystal glass, the latter of which, according to Bugatti, has never before been employed in automotive interior design. It looks simultaneously retro and uniquely forward-thinking. There is a digital display, but the car can be operated without it. \"We decided deliberately to get rid of the screens as much as we could,\" Heyl says. \"That's the whole concept, of interacting with the car in a totally analog way. The whole human/machine interface is analog.\"\n\nThe audio system is, apparently, still in the works and will feature exactly zero traditional speakers. Instead, your AC/DC will funnel into the cabin via \"exciters on the door panels and throughout the car.\"\n\nThe Tourbillon's Price\n\nBugatti's limited 250-car run will come with a starting price of $4.6 million (including import duty, gas guzzler tax, and air freight fee). It is almost certain that every one of the 250 will be spoken for before the first car is delivered, if they haven't been ordered already -- and that their values will only rise.\n\nWe reached out to one Chiron owner, who was invited to see the new Tourbillon in Los Angeles and has already ordered one. \"This [new] car is a big step forward for Bugatti,\" says Bilal Hydrie, the president and CEO of a Canada-based energy company. \"It showcases their commitment to pushing the limits of what's possible in car design and performance. With its hybrid engine and innovative materials, it's setting a new benchmark for hypercars and keeping Bugatti at the top of the game.\"\n\nFor mere mortals who cannot afford the multi-million-dollar price tag, as well as those who can but who cannot get an allocation, these cars have the added value of entertainment -- to see them in photos, to get a rare glimpse on the road or at a car show. For the engineers, however, the work has just begun; now they'll need to make these cars live up to their gargantuan expectations once they hit the road in 2026.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

On display at a star-studded world premiere in Molsheim, France, the all-new hypercar marks a complete departure from the brand's iconic W16 engine. This time it has been electrified, with the help of Mate Rimac, the unstoppable force behind the all-electric Nevera, the fastest accelerating hypercar in the world. I attended the launch event and talked to Rimac about his approach to the design of the new multi-million-dollar monster.\n\nFirst off, while the Tourbillon is electrified, it isn't in the way most people predicted (and some feared). Since Rimac joined forces with Bugatti and Porsche nearly three years ago, there has been an expectation that the new Bugatti would take the drivetrain of the Nevera or a heavily modified version of it, and become all-electric. But that hasn't happened. Instead, the Tourbillon follows the hybrid route plotted by Ferrari with the SF90 Stradale and McLaren with the Artura - except with a uniquely Bugatti twist.\n\nThere is still an all-new 8.3-liter naturally aspirated V16 engine, engineered in collaboration with legendary British race engine maker Cosworth, playing a central role. But this has been paired with a powerful electric powertrain consisting of a front e-axle with two electric motors and an additional rear motor. The combination delivers a staggering 1,800 hp, exceeding the Bugatti Veyron's output despite the combustion engine being naturally aspirated. The electric motors offer immediate torque and agility, while the 25kWh battery allows for a usable all-electric range of over 37 miles.\n\nI asked Mate Rimac about the powertrain choice when we met in Zagreb a week before the launch. \"I'm fully convinced that normal transport will go electric,\" he says. \"It just makes more sense. But there will be very specific niches where combustion is going to stick around for a lot longer than people think. It's just something that people are emotional about.\" This is something I rediscovered when I recently test-drove the Maserati MC20. \"Also, certain brands will have a hard time differentiating themselves without having a combustion engine because that's what they built their heritage on. So going electric will be difficult for them.\"\n\n\"However, with electric you can do exciting things that you can't do with combustion, which is what we've achieved with the Nevera,\" says Rimac. \"Our customers have dozens of cars in their garages, so they do not necessarily want just one type of vehicle. You need to offer them something special. Electric can be special. That's what we show with the Nevera. It has almost 2,000 horsepower, 27 world records and does crazy stuff like drift mode. Our customers love the car. But for different markets and categories of cars, it will be a very easy transition or a very difficult one to go electric. We have positioned ourselves as the pioneers - the slightly crazy guys who do stuff that others don't do and there is a market for those cars. I also believe that the market for combustion engine cars in this category will live on for quite a while.\"\n\nThe Tourbillon comes from a lengthy heritage of combustion greatness. It draws inspiration from Bugatti's rich 115-year history, guided by founder Ettore Bugatti's pursuit of automotive excellence. His mantras, \"if comparable it is no longer Bugatti\" and \"nothing is too beautiful,\" are embedded in the Tourbillon's design and engineering, which spares no expense nor shirks any engineering challenge. The Tourbillon pays homage to legendary Bugatti models like the Type 57SC Atlantic, Type 35, and Type 41 Royale, embodying beauty, performance, and unmatched luxury.\n\nHowever, unlike previous Bugattis, the Tourbillon abandons the tradition of naming core models after racing drivers. Instead, \"Tourbillon\", a French word referencing a watchmaking invention (and already used for some actual Bugatti-branded timepieces), is meant to reflect the car's intricate mechanics and enduring elegance. The design prioritizes timeless appeal, employing a completely analogue instrument cluster crafted by Swiss watchmakers. Every component is meticulously chosen to ensure the Tourbillon remains a cherished heirloom for generations to come, like a classic Swiss timepiece.\n\nAs with all modern Bugattis, the Tourbillon is also sculpted for exceptional aerodynamics. Every surface, intake, and ridge is meticulously honed to achieve not only aerodynamic efficiency but also optimal performance for the car's V16 engine, electric motors, and battery. The Tourbillon boasts several patented technologies honed over two decades of Bugatti's experience with the Veyron and Chiron. But the most revolutionary feature is the drivetrain.\n\n\"When I was thinking about what to do with the Bugatti brand, I considered how Bugatti has had many types of cars, not just hypercars - race cars, huge luxury cars, and GTs,\" says Rimac. \"So you could go in many directions, but in every direction Bugatti is the pinnacle of the auto industry. I realized the brand was about pushing the limits, and we needed to continue that. Our shareholders were very much pushing for an electric car, and that would have been the easiest thing because we had the Nevera with 2,000 horsepower and 400-plus km/h. On paper you could just restyle it into a Bugatti. That was what everyone expected but I thought it was the wrong thing to do, because Bugatti is about heritage sport craftsmanship. It's about 115 years of history. I felt a Bugatti still needs a combustion engine, so four years ago I made a 3D printed concept of the car. It had a V16 engine and an electric motor in the rear and two electric motors in the front, with the battery pack in the middle. I brought this to the Volkswagen Group management and said this is what I want to do.\"\n\nThe Tourbillon is also built upon an entirely new chassis and body structure, to complement the unique motor configuration. The structure utilizes a next-generation T800 carbon composite, incorporating weight-saving innovations like a battery integrated into the monocoque and a revolutionary crash composite rear diffuser. The car also features a completely new multi-link suspension system, forged from aluminum, for exceptional handling.\n\n\"I realized the Volkswagen Group is not a company with one opinion, it's lots of people with lots of different opinions,\" says Rimac. \"So it was all very political but we managed to do the deal, and I got a huge opportunity to lead the brand into the next chapter. I wanted to create a super emotional combustion engine enabled by high performance electric poetry. It is all about the combustion engine, with the electric powertrain in the background. It has an old school, somewhat weak engine that doesn't have the power, but you have the electric powertrain making up for that and more. You have immediate throttle response, torque vectoring and regenerative braking at low RPM. All the disadvantages of the combustion engine go away. But then you can have a really cool combustion engine.\"\n\n\"The W16 in the Chiron is an amazing motor, but the only thing you hear is the turbos,\" adds Rimac. \"It's a unique sound, but it's just turbos, and when you push the throttle, nothing happens for a second if you're not in the right RPM range and boost. The Tourbillon doesn't have that. It has an amazing V16 naturally aspirated engine sound and torque more than you can ever wish for from very low speeds because of the electric motors. It's bringing the advantages of the two sides together into a super high tech electric powertrain, which is basically Formula One technology.\"\n\nWith a starting price of \u20ac3.8 million and limited to only 250 units, the Bugatti Tourbillon is another exclusive vehicle for very special customers. It embodies Bugatti's relentless pursuit of innovation and dedication to crafting timeless masterpieces. The Tourbillon is meant to be more than a car; it's meant to be a testament to Bugatti's unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of automotive engineering and design.\n\n\"I feel like an artist with two canvases,\" says Rimac. \"There's Bugatti, which is about heritage, luxury and craftsmanship - quality leather, the analogue feel, more like a classical traditional watchmaker. Then there's Rimac, which is about the extreme of high performance, pushing boundaries, doing crazy stuff, maybe stuff that's a little bit too extreme for an old brand.\"\n\n\"At 36 years old I've developed five cars completely from the ground up,\" concludes Rimac. \"I've learned so much along the way. I'm super self-critical and find 1,000 things in previous projects that we could have done better. But with the Tourbillon, nothing fell off the table. It's really amazing - the interior, the powertrain and everything - and you can see that by the response from customers. Despite only offering 250 cars at a 3.8 million Euro starting price, it was almost sold out before we even showed it to the public. That's a reflection of the attractiveness of the product. We still have a lot to offer with the Bugatti brand - and Rimac - so I feel great about the way business is going.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"},

The cost to own one of the scant 250 units slated for production? Pricing starts at $4 million and rockets north, depending on your customization of the carbon fiber-drenched coupe. Even though owners will have to wait two years to receive delivery, the queue of prospective buyers already exceeds the volume of allocations. For good reason; this is a revolutionary machine.\n\nWhy? For starters, it's the first Bugatti crafted under Mate Rimac's stewardship. The 36-year-old Croatian entrepreneur is the CEO of Bugatti Rimac, installed in 2021 after his eponymously electric vehicle hypercar company merged with Bugatti. Rimac brings his mind-bending EV performance to the engineering table, and this is the first hybrid ever to emerge from Molsheim, France, the home of Bugatti's factory. And, in an era where vehicles only increase in size and weight, as a penalty for increased power output, with Tourbillon, Rimac and Bugatti have achieved the opposite: more oomph from a smaller, lighter car.\n\n\"This is the first time in history a hybrid car is lighter than its combustion predecessor,\" Rimac tells me, though he declines to give an exact overall weight, saying that final material selections, including titanium or 3D-printed alloys, are still being determined.\n\nTourbillon is exceptionally beautiful to behold, with design cues borrowed from Bugatti's century-plus history of timeless automobiles (including the iconic Type 57SC), but also falcons, the fastest animal on the planet. However, everything you see here is an example of class-leading form that is underpinned by function. \"Nothing is fake or there to be fancy,\" Rimac says. \"Everything has a purpose. Take the rubies in the speedometer; those are low friction bearings for the movement of the mechanism for the instrument cluster.\"", "source": {"uri": "fastcompany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fast Company"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coupe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sapphire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Rimac", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speedometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molsheim", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(mechanical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bearing (mechanical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Titanium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D printing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/06/p-91143714-Bugatti-Chiron.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The compact-sized Escape PHEV, for example, boasts 14.4 kilowatt hours. Over at Mercedes, the S 580 e 4MATIC is equipped with a high-voltage battery rated at 28.6 kWh. Mate Rimac has recently confirmed that Bugatti's next-gen hypercar is a plug-in hybrid as well. Its high-voltage battery promises 25 kilowatt hours or thereabout, with said energy going to three electric motors. In a similar fashion to the V12-powered Revuelto and the lesser SF90, one motor is located in the rear, and the other drive the front wheels.\n\nThe big kahuna at Bugatti Rimac further confirmed usable all-electric range, but who is he kidding? Not even a single customer buys the yet-unnamed successor of the Chiron for zero-emission range, but rather its badge and that fabulous V16 mill.\n\nTo debut on June 20, the plug-in hybrid thriller is built around a carbon-fiber tub \u00e0 la Rimac's quad-motor Nevera. The Croatian hypercar may be a hoot in many respects, but on the other hand, the lack of internal combustion hinders its appeal.\n\nMate says that a naturally aspirated V16 is the perfect choice for the newcomer because of its uniqueness and emotional aspect. A high-revving lump that's believed to displace 8.3 liters compared to 8.0 for the quad-turbo W16 of the Chiron, said engine was allegedly developed with input from Cosworth. Almost 40 inches long, the V16 is reportedly good for 1,000 ponies on its own.\n\nPhoto: Bugatti Add those electric drive units to the mix for something like 1,800 horses at full chatter, which - as you're well aware - is more than any Chiron ever produced. With a bit of luck, this fellow could trump the Bolide's original rating of 1,825 horsepower. The final version of the Chiron-based track car develops 1,578 horsepower, therefore matching the max output of the Super Sport.\n\nMate Rimac made it clear that Bugatti's new V16 wouldn't mean anything without hybrid assistance, and he does have a point. 1,000-odd ponies for a hypercar in this day and age is a bit underwhelming, for the Revuelto produces 1,001 horsepower. Despite colossal pressure to consider an electric-only powertrain, Rimac and his crew eventually convinced the Herbert Diess-era Volkswagen Group to agree on a plug-in hybrid setup. Not as a compromise between two extremes, but rather as the natural step forward from the mighty W16 masterminded by the one and only Ferdinand Piech.\n\nShowcased to customers in March 2024, the new kid on the block retains the C-shaped profile element of its forerunner. The pronounced front and rear fenders also hark back to the Chiron and Veyron, whereas the rear end is more Nevera than Chiron or Veyron. Expected to spin all the way to 9,000 revolutions per minute, Bugatti's new V16 will be mated to a dual-clutch box at the company's Molsheim facility.\n\nHearsay suggests that only 250 units are in the offing, with production to start in 2026. Top speed? As per information obtained by Auto Motor und Sport, make that 445 kilometers per hour (277 miles per hour).", "source": {"uri": "autoevolution.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "autoevolution"},

Then came Chiron. Now Tourbillon. Revealed today, Bugatti's new 1,800 hp hypercar delivers even more shock-and-awe than its predecessors. Gone is the famed 8.0-liter quad-turbo W16 engine. In its place is a new 1,000 hp, 8.3-liter naturally aspirated V16 paired with a trio of electric motors delivering 800 hp. That combination makes this the most powerful Bugatti ever.\n\nWhile the design of the all-carbon-composite body is clearly derived from the signature lines of both the Veyron and Chiron, its roofline is lower, the body lighter and more aerodynamic, and that iconic horseshoe grille more imposing. Yet the likely headline feature will be the car's all-new interior featuring a skeletonized, titanium-and-sapphire-glass instrument cluster inspired by Swiss watchmaking (\"tourbillon\" referring to a mechanical complication that increases accuracy in high-end timepieces).\n\n\"Beauty, performance, and luxury formed the blueprint for the Tourbillon. What we have created is a car that is more elegant, more emotive, and more luxurious than anything before it,\" stated Mate Rimac, Bugatti-Rimac's CEO, to Robb Report during an exclusive preview at the company's newly opened design studio in Berlin.\n\nHe explained that, four years ago, when the Tourbillon concept was on the drawing board, there were multiple suggestions for what an all-new Bugatti might look like. Options included an SUV, a coupe-like crossover, and a luxury four-door sedan. Then there was the choice of either a hybrid or all-electric power train.\n\n\"The proposal to make it electric was the obvious choice. We had our [Rimac] Nevera, that we could easily transfer our technology and re-skin the body. But I felt it was wrong for Bugatti,\" said Rimac. \"I wanted a successor to the Veyron and Chiron, a true hypercar with a combustion engine. Our customers agreed.\"\n\nTo create it, Rimac teamed with Cosworth, a renowned British engine builder, to help develop the naturally aspirated V16 mill. Designed to rev to 9,000 rpm, the engine offers a similar output as the original Veyron's quad-turbocharged W16. To heighten the performance, Rimac and his team used their proven expertise in electric propulsion to pair the V16 with twin electric motors driving the front wheels, with a third at the rear. For battery power, a 25 kWh, oil-cooled 800-volt pack is integrated into the chassis and located behind the passengers. It's powerful enough to give the Tourbillon a usable electric-only range of around 37 miles.\n\nAs you would expect, the Tourbillon has been developed to be blisteringly fast. According to Emilio Scervo, Bugatti's chief technical officer, early prototype tests suggest a rate of acceleration from zero to 62 mph in 2.0 seconds, zero to 124 mph in 5.0 seconds, and zero to 186 mph in 10.0 seconds. Flat out, the max-speed target is 445 kph (276 mph), though with a speedometer that reads up to 550 kph (341 mph), we expect there's more to come.\n\n\"For us, it was important that the car retained the pure and raw analog feel of a naturally aspirated combustion engine, while pairing it with the agility and ability provided by electric motors,\" said Scervo.\n\nThe engine itself sits low in the Tourbillon's new, super-stiff body structure, which is formed using next-generation T800 carbon composites. It features a forged-aluminum, multi-link suspension -- front and rear -- that replaces the previous double-wishbone steel setup used in the Chiron. The 3-D-printed aluminum suspension arms and uprights, and AI-developed, 3-D-printed hollow airfoil arm at the rear, are nothing less than pieces of art.\n\nFor the exterior lines, Frank Heyl, Bugatti's director of design, explained that styling influences came from three landmark Bugattis of old: the Type 35 racer of the 1920s, the mile-long Type 41 Royale built from 1927 through 1933, and the storied Type 57SC Atlantic from the 1930s.\n\n\"The design focus was on Bugatti's iconic horseshoe grille. It's significantly wider and lower than in the Chiron, and it's from which all lines of the car originate. It defines the car,\" said Heyl, who added that another signature element is \"the new central windshield wiper, which continues the line that starts on the hood and flows back along the roof. Just like on the Atlantic.\"\n\nSet back from the grille are twin rows of wafer-thin LED lights that measure less than a half-inch thick. Between them is a narrow panel on the hood that raises up to reveal a \"frunk\" big enough for a set of custom-designed luggage.\n\nIn profile, the sweeping \"Bugatti line\" around the doors -- a defining feature of both the Veyron and Chiron -- looks even more striking with the car's lowered roofline. At the rear, huge exhausts, a Le Mans-style carbon-fiber diffuser (twice the size of that on the Chiron), and a rolling wave of LED lights featuring illuminated \"Bugatti\" lettering, add to the visual drama. And to allow onlookers to gaze at that V16 power plant, the engine sits open to the elements.\n\nUpon opening the dihedral \"scissor\" doors and entering the cockpit, you're presented with arguably the new Tourbillon's most dramatic feature; a skeletonized instrument cluster inspired by the art of Swiss watchmaking. Made up of more than 600 components, it's constructed from titanium with sapphire-glass faces and detailing that incorporates rubies.\n\nThe three-dial cluster is fixed in place with the twin spokes of the flat-bottom steering wheel rotating around it. The unit is constructed, in-house, to remarkable horological tolerances of 50 microns -- the average cross-section of a human hair. The entire cluster weighs just 25 ounces.\n\nCascading down from the middle of the fascia is the similarly intricate center console that features crystal glass that's formed over 13 separate stages to ensure strength and clarity. The aluminum elements are anodized and milled from a single block.\n\nTo add a little theater to firing-up that big V16, there's a prominent center-console aluminum knob that you pull to start, and push to turn off. It's another nod to Bugatti models of yesteryear. What you won't see, however, are any touchscreens. Frank Heyl believes that the primary element that dates a car is an oversized screen. \"What was state-of-the-art 10 years ago, is now ugly,' said Heyl. \"The Tourbillon is designed to be timeless.\"\n\nIn Bugatti tradition, the Tourbillon will also be highly exclusive. Mate Rimac plans to offer just 250 examples, each starting at \u20ac3.8 million, or $4.08 million at today's exchange rate. The first customer cars are scheduled to be built at Bugatti's atelier in Molsheim, France, starting in 2026.\n\n\"Yes, it is crazy to build a new V16 engine, to integrate it with a new battery pack

Enter the Bugatti Tourbillon. Powered by a new V16 plug-in-hybrid powertrain, built on a new structure and featuring a spectacular design inside and out, Bugatti's goal for the Tourbillon is for it to remain timeless \"for all eternity.\"\n\nCEO Mate Rimac says Ettore Bugatti's sentiments of \"if comparable it is no longer Bugatti\" and \"nothing is too beautiful\" were his main guiding paths for the new model, the first one developed under the Bugatti-Rimac venture that was established in 2021. Three iconic Bugattis were chosen as inspiration: The Type 57SC Atlantic, the Type 35, and the Type 41 Royale. The new car needed to feature design and engineering techniques that would ensure the car will look at home on concours lawns into the next centuries, as modern technology can get dated fast.\n\nThus the name: Tourbillon is a type of watchmaking invented by Swiss-French genius Abraham-Louis Breguet in which the balance wheel and escapement are mounted in a rotating cage to counteract gravity and increase accuracy in their timekeeping. Such mechanisms are still the pinnacle of watchmaking, says Bugatti, and the Tourbillon certainly seems like the pinnacle of the automotive realm -- Rimac calls it \"more elegant, more emotive and more luxurious than anything before it. Quite simply, incomparable.\" It helps that the car has a number of watch-inspired design elements, too.\n\nNot just a reworked Chiron, the Tourbillon is built off a completely new chassis and structure made from next-generation T800 carbon composite. Its front and rear frames use 3D-printed braces and low-pressure thin-wall aluminum casting, and the hollow arm of the rear wing is AI-developed and also 3D-printed. Where the Chiron had steel double-wishbone suspension, the Tourbillion has an aluminum multi-link setup that has \"organic-designed\" arms and uprights that were 3D-printed from aluminum, a 45-percent weight savings versus the Chiron.\n\nBugatti calls the Tourbillon's powertrain a \"masterpiece of internal combustion engineering,\" and it certainly seems like a suitable replacement for the groundbreaking W16. It all starts with a naturally aspirated 8.3-liter V16 that was developed with Cosworth's assistance. On its own the engine makes 1,000 horsepower and 664 pound-feet of torque, and it revs to a 9,000-rpm redline, nearly 2,000 rpm higher than the Chiron Super Sport. The engine weighs just 556 pounds, nearly half as much as the Chiron's quad-turbo W16.\n\nIntegrated as a structural part of the monocoque is the oil-cooled 24.8-kWh 800-volt battery pack, which is mounted in the central tunnel and behind the passengers. An e-axle at front houses two electric motors and there's a third electric motor at the rear axle; all have an integrated dual silicon-carbide inverter and are able to spin at up to 24,000 rpm. Bugatti says the Tourbillon's electric powertrain is one of the most power-dense in the world, and the motors make a total 800 hp. This setup gives the Tourbillon all-wheel drive and totally variable torque vectoring, and it also provides an electric range of over 37 miles, far greater than any other plug-in-hybrid supercar.\n\nTotal output is 1,800 horsepower, more than any other modern Bugatti. A longitudinal 8-speed dual-clutch transmission The company says it will hit 62 mph in 2 seconds flat, reach 124 mph in under 5 seconds and hit 186 mph in less than 10 seconds. Reaching 248 mph from a stop requires fewer than 25 seconds. Normally the Tourbillon's top speed is 236 mph, but use the Speed Key and that raises to 276 mph, 12 mph faster than the standard Chiron and 3 mph more than the non-300+ versions of the Chiron Super Sport. Bugatti has previously said it's done chasing top speed records after being the first company to hit 300 mph, but it's at least nice to see that it's not done making its new cars faster than the last. The whole thing sounds incredible too, as you can hear in the above video.\n\nThe carbon-ceramic brakes are new too, with a bespoke brake-by-wire system that was developed by Bugatti and \"blends seamlessly through an integrated vehicle non-linear controller.\" Bugatti still uses normal five-lug wheels instead of center-lock units like many other supercars, wrapped with Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 2 tires sized 285/35R20 up front and 345/30R21 at the rear.\n\nThat V16 is quite huge -- the crankshaft is a meter long -- so it's no surprise the Tourbillon is bigger than the Chiron. At 183.9 inches long it's 5 inches longer than its predecessor, and the Tourbillon's 107.9-inch wheelbase is stretched by 1.2 inches. The Tourbillon is about an inch lower to the ground, too. Despite the V16 and the heft added by the hybrid system Bugatti says the Tourbillon is lighter than the Chiron thanks to its construction and other weight-savings measures.\n\nThe Tourbillon's styling is a natural evolution of what we've seen from Bugattis like La Voiture Noire, the Mistral and the never-produced Atlantic coupe concept -- and I think it's quite spectacular. Its wedge-shaped proportions are even more dramatic, its details even more intricate. Bugatti says there are four main design elements that make up its modern cars: the central ridge down the middle of the car, the C-shaped Bugatti Line on the sides, the split dual-color scheme, and the horseshoe grille. All are present, and all are more exaggerated than what we've seen before.\n\nEverything about the design was dictated by the aerodynamics required to reach past 250 mph and the thermodynamics required to cool the V16 and hybrid system. Bugatti says the Tourbillon's shape was inspired by falcons -- the fastest animals on Earth (though still not as fast as a Bugatti -- most notably in its teardrop profile and lower and wider frontal area. The Tourbillon's nose is also inspired by Jean Bugatti's Surbaiss\u00e9 method, which allowed for the Type 57SC Atlantic to have a lower nose and thus a higher top speed.\n\nBugatti says that all of the Tourbillon's lines originate from the horseshoe grille, which is larger and wider than even the Mistral's. It's flanked by giant air intakes that appear swept-back from the prominent nose in profile, with central bars that form the start of the Bugatti Line.\n\n\"Flying fenders\" appear freestanding from the hood itself, sitting atop super-thin four-element LED headlights that have air channels underneath them. The hood's intakes are bigger than the Chiron's, and an \"ultra-efficient\" cooling system directs air through and out of the hood. All of the front e-axle's components fit within the same packaging space as the Chiron, and Bugatti was able to give the Tourbillon a larger luggage compartment that, of course, features bespoke fitted luggage.\n\nWhere the Veyron's Bugatti Line was \"leaned back\" and the Chiron's \"horizontal,\" Bugatti describes the Tourbillon's C-Line as being \"wedged forward,\" coming to more of a point than its predecessors with a much more dramatic rake. It's nice to see that the side intakes haven't really grown, though the Tourbillon has a much more prominent coke-bottle shape with large rear fenders that are really nicely sculpted. The carbon-fiber side skirts have gill-like vanes, with a subtle French flag at the leading edge.\n\nA thin taillight strip with 3D elements and an illuminated Bugatti script follows the contour of the rear end, which has absolutely massive intakes and a shape like an infinity sign. The underbody diffuser starts rising from just behind the passengers, and because of the engine's V configuration the diffuser's channels are able to sweep around the engine. The diffuser also functions as part of the crash structure, with the vertical strakes negating the need for a metal crash beam in the bumper, and there's a thin, wide trapezoidal exhaust tip on each side. Similar to the Lamborghini Revuelto, the diffuser allows for much of the rear tires to be exposed, helping emphasize the car's width. Unlike the Tourbillon's predecessors, its active rear wing remains flush in top-speed mode, instead deploying to give more downforce at lower speeds and acting as an airbrake to improve stability when braking.\n\nAs with the Veyron and Chiron the Tourbillon's engine bay is exposed to the elements, and the engine is presented as being even more integral with the car's body. There are four stunning carbon-fiber mounts that flow into the engine bay surround, and the central spine now features a long CHMSL brake light. Speaking of the spine, which is more pronounced than on the Chiron, it's echoed by a single windshield wiper that sits in the center of the windshield when it's not in use.\n\nOpen the Tourbillon's electrically actuated butterfly doors -- a first for Bugatti, and they can be opened from the key fob -- and you're greeted by an interior that's also evolutionary in overall design but has a number of radical elements. Driver and passenger are cocooned in their own teardrop-shaped zones, with an illuminated central spine running from the peak of the windshield, down the bulkhead and forming the thin center console. The dual-color split is really well done, wrapping around the occupants with plenty of contrasting stitching and other accents. I especially love the woven leather on the seats and door panels.\n\nBugatti muses that Tourbillon watches from 100 years ago are still able to be worn and used today, seamlessly fitting in with modern fashion, and it took the same approach for the Tourbillon's controls. That philosophy is most obvious in the absurdly complex analog gauge cluster, which is built with the help of Swiss watchmakers. The center dial features the speedometer (which goes to 550 kph) on the outside rim and the tachometer inside of it; the right dial shows how much power you're using from both the engine and the hybrid system; and three small dials to the left show battery charge, fuel level, and oil and coolant temperature.\n\nConstructed using more than 600 parts, the \"skeletonized\" gauges are made from titanium and feature gemstones like rubies and sapphires. All of the internals are visible through the gauge faces, which looks incredible in motion. Bugatti says the largest tolerance is 50 microns while the smallest is only 5 microns, and the whole thing weighs just 700 grams. The gauges are fixed to the central hub of the steering wheel, which itself is fixed, meaning only the rim of the wheel rotates around when turning. If you own an old Citro\u00ebn C4, you can now say your car is just like a Bugatti. The rim has thumb controls for media and other infotainment functions, while the hub has a pair of knobs for drive modes and hybrid settings -- no more buttons shared with a Volkswagen!\n\nAnother touch inspired by high-end watches is the center console and dashboard, which uses a mix of aluminum and crystal glass. The aluminum parts are milled from a single block of metal and anodized, and the glass was developed over 13 stages to make sure it stays perfectly clear and is safe in case of an accident. There are two large knobs at the top that each have a display in the center and control the climate control and volume, a few toggle switches that appear freestanding in the open console, and a small glass toggle shifter.\n\nA traditional start/stop button would've been too normal, so the Tourbillon has a lever that you pull to start and push to turn off, a \"physical experience\" that Bugatti says is \"a nod to the rituals of historic automobiles.\" You can see the inner workings of many of the controls, just like the gauge cluster. Each door has an aluminum knob at the front of the grab handle that controls things like the seats and mirrors, with a button on top for locking and unlocking, but the actual door opening switches are in the center console. There's also a panel on the roof that has additional switches.\n\nDisplays in the control knobs and the small digital speedo readout aside, the only screen in the interior is hidden away until it's needed by the driver. The small touchscreen deploys from the top of the center console and can be presented in either portrait or landscape mode; it takes two seconds to emerge for the backup camera, and five seconds for the full landscape setup. Apple CarPlay is available, and the screen can show vehicle data and other functions.\n\nThe seats are fixed to the floor, which Bugatti says lets them be as light as possible and mounted as low as possible, with the pedal box being electrically adjustable. Don't worry, the company promises no compromises were made in terms of comfort. Instead of a traditional audio system with regular speakers and woofers, the Tourbillon has exciters mounted in interior panels like the door cards, which is a lighter and more efficient solution.\n\nI think the below press release quotes from Mat\u00e9 Rimac sum up why I'm so excited to have him at the helm of Bugatti. He just gets it, he understands the history of the brand and why the cars are so revered today, while never losing the desire for innovation that Rimac has come to be known for. Said Rimac:\n\nWe look back through Bugatti history at the creations of Ettore and Jean and you can immediately see that they refused to compromise. The amount of patents Ettore had to his name was incredible, because he didn't ever want the simplest solution, he always wanted the best solution, even if it didn't exist yet. He'd go away and he'd build it, test it and refine it until it was perfect. And then he'd make it beautiful. It is why the cars are so revered today, and it is the driving force behind everything we have done with Tourbillon.\n\n\"So yes, it is crazy to build a new V16 engine, to integrate with a new battery pack and electric motors and to have a real Swiss-made watchmaker instrument cluster and 3D- printed suspension parts and a Crystal Glass center console. But it is what Ettore would have done, and it is what makes a Bugatti incomparable and timeless. Without that kind of ambition, you might create a great hyper sports car, but you wouldn't create an icon Pour l'e\u0301ternite\u0301'.\n\nWhile 450 Veyrons and 500 Chirons were produced, only 250 units of the Tourbillon will be built. It'll start at \u20ac3.8 million, the equivalent of just over $4 million -- not that much more than the Chiron, which originally started at $3 million. Customer deliveries will commence at some point in 2026 after production of the Bolide and Mistral has finished, and the Tourbillon will be hand-assembled at the Bugatti Atelier in Molsheim, France.", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "3D printing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuser_(automotive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diffuser (automotive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham-Louis_Breguet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham-Louis Breguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Bugatti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ettore Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bugatti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molsheim", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/bda152b7bd18963f14952911a2ea8406.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

There's certainly a striking resemblance to the old W-16-powered hypercar, but this a completely new beast. The monocoque is new. The suspension is new. And the hybrid V-16 powertrain is most definitely new. Say hello to Bugatti's next-generation 1,800-horsepower flagship, the Tourbillon.\n\nThe previous reports about the engine were true -- this is an 8.3-liter monster that revs to 9,000 RPM and makes 1,000 horsepower without any turbochargers. Cosworth helped develop the naturally aspirated beast, which weighs just 555 pounds despite being significantly larger than the W-16 it replaces. There's also 664 pound-feet of torque, but of greater interest here is the other half of the Tourbillon's powertrain.\n\nWe're talking about the hybrid assistance. A front e-axle carries two electric motors, with a third motor positioned at the back to help spin the rear wheels. A 25 kWh centrally-mounted battery pack supplies power, adding 800 hp to the mix. The combined output is 1,800 hp, and provided the bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires have enough grip, the Tourbillon will reach 62 mph (100 km/h) in just 2.0 seconds.\n\nBut that's not a proper metric to convey the Tourbillon's true performance. Under full throttle, 124 mph is reached in around 5.0 seconds. 186 mph arrives in a mere 10 seconds. The top speed of 236 mph happens in less than 25 seconds, unless you have the special Speed Key installed. When activated, the Tourbillon keeps its ginormous rear wing hunkered down while the speed climbs all the way to 276 mph.\n\nThe latest Bugatti doesn't lose anything in becoming a hybrid, except a little bit of weight. Yes, despite a battery pack and electric motors, Bugatti says the Tourbillon is lighter than the Chiron. It can also cruise around town without using that snazzy V-16 engine. Actually, it can go beyond town with an estimated EV range of 37 miles. There's no mention of speed on electric power, and Bugatti isn't ready to talk about charging times. But it uses an 800-volt system, and lest we forget, Mate Rimac is steering Bugatti these days. And he knows a thing or two about electric performance.\n\nWatch connoisseurs will recognize tourbillon as mechanical bits used in high-quality timepieces to increase accuracy. Bugatti sees its Tourbillon as a big, timeless work of mechanical perfection. That becomes readily apparent when you open the electrically actuated dihedral doors to see the stunning analog interior. Three large dials affixed to the steering wheel display everything from speed to engine revs, fuel quantity, engine temperature, and more. There isn't a screen in sight.\n\nThe gauges were designed and crafted by Switch watchmakers, and they're permanently fixed to the steering column so they remain stationary as you turn the wheel. Meanwhile in the center console, you'll find banks of aluminum switches, rotary dials, and a single crystal lever that starts the V-16. The purpose of all this is to give the Tourbillon a timeless look, but there is a hidden digital screen at the top of the center console. On command, it will rotate up and give the driver access to Apple CarPlay, among other things.\n\nAs for the design, there's no mistaking it for a Bugatti. The Chiron-esque exterior features a special diffuser that begins just behind the passenger cabin, virtually hidden from view. Vents under the headlights help funnel air to the large side intakes. The horseshoe grille feeds air to radiators while also augmenting downforce. The active rear wing can deploy upward to serve as an airbrake. And it all rides on a completely new multi-link suspension that is 45 percent lighter compared to the Chiron's bones.\n\n\"The development of the Bugatti Tourbillon was guided at every step by the 115 years of Bugatti history and the words of Ettore Bugatti himself,\" said Bugatti CEO Mate Rimac. \"His mantras 'if comparable it is no longer Bugatti' and 'nothing is too beautiful' were a guiding path for me personally, as well as the design and engineering teams looking to create the next exciting era in the Bugatti hyper sports car story.\"\n\nThough we're seeing the car today, that era won't begin until 2026 when the first of 250 production cars will be delivered. Right now, the Tourbillon is currently in its testing phase, so start saving those pennies. You'll need every single one, because the Tourbillon's starting price is 3.6 million Euros (around $3.9 million at current exchange rates).", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battery pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocoque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monocoque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cylinder (engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derivative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettore_Bugatti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ettore Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/7ZQgo6/s3/bugatti-tourbillon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Watch the Reveal Here", "body": "The successor to the Bugatti Chiron will pack a naturally aspirated V16 with hybrid assistance.\n\nToday is the day we finally get to see what Bugatti's been cooking up for its successor to the Chiron. While the launch of a new multi-million dollar hypercar for the uber-rich might seem trivial for most of us, it's actually a pretty big deal. This marks only the third new Bugatti since the brand was revived under the Volkswagen Group, starting with the Veyron back in 2005. Even the Chiron, which still seems fresh, is almost a decade old, having debuted in 2016.\n\nToday also marks the beginning of a new era for Bugatti. This is the brand's first launch under the supervision of CEO Mate Rimac, who also owns his namesake electric hypercar company. It will be interesting to see how much of Rimac's performance EV knowhow makes it into the new Bug.\n\nSpeaking of performance, the new Bugatti -- whose name will be revealed later today -- will have an entirely new engine layout for the first time since the Veyron. Since the brand returned in 2005, Bugatti has exclusively used quad-turbocharged W16 engines. Now, though, it's switching to an all-new naturally aspirated V16 with hybrid assistance.\n\nBugatti teased its new powertrain a few times already, showing off its valve cover, firing order, and even its exhaust sound. In the latest teaser, we see a gorgeous Swiss watch-like gauge cluster with a skeletonized clock-face acting like both a speedometer and tachometer. While this seems to just be teasing a countdown to the car's reveal, if the actual gauge cluster looks anything like that, it will be stunning. Also, it seems that the speedo goes over 500 km/h. Is Bugatti hinting at challenging Koenigsegg for the 310 mph-plus speed record? We can hear it rev in the short clip, shift gears, and even calm back down, and it all sounds glorious.\n\nThe livestream reveal of this new hybrid V16 Bugatti begins at 4:00 p.m. EST and can be seen at the video embed above, or the link here.", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nico_demattia@thedrive.com", "name": "Nico DeMattia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigsegg", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Koenigsegg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tachometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppet_valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poppet valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speedometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gear"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/videoframe_17530-copy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

As the follow-up to two of the most iconic luxury-performance vehicles of the past two decades, the Tourbillon has some sizable shoes to fill, as both the Veyron and the Chiron were standard bearers of hypercar engineering during their respective eras.\n\nThe high-performance landscape has also gone through some fairly dramatic changes in the time since. While the near-1,500 horsepower produced by the Chiron's quad-turbocharged W16 was otherworldly in 2016, it seems notably less remarkable at a point in time when there are luxury sedans capable of producing more than 1,200 horsepower and the world's quickest production vehicle offers nearly 2,000 hp.\n\nThe paradigm shift brought on by high-performance EVs has not gone unnoticed by Bugatti, though. In 2022, the automaker formed a technical alliance with Rimac, the Croatian EV upstart that produces the world-beating Nevera. In its early stages, the partnership tasked Rimac with the development of an all-new powerplant for what would eventually become the Tourbillon, but the agreement soon evolved to effectively give Rimac founder and CEO Mate Rimac full control of the Bugatti brand through a 55/45 split with Porsche, Bugatti's prior parent company.\n\nBugatti Tourbillon action group View 7 Photos\n\nThis, of course, begs a question: How do you follow up an automotive icon like the Chiron with something that feels equally unprecedented when your other company has upstaged that car with its own technology? As Bugatti design director Frank Heyl explained it, you focus less on the stats and more on the experience.\n\n\"Yes, obviously it will be extremely fast. But I don't really like to talk about the numbers. It's more about how you feel in the driver's seat, the sensations - the haptics of the switchgear, the smell of the leather, and the sounds and vibrations of the engine. It's an emotional experience that can't really be expressed in numbers.\"\n\nThat experience is driven in no small part by the Tourbillon's jaw-dropping hybrid powertrain. At the front end of the Tourbillon, there's a dual-motor and dual-inverter setup that's good for 600 horsepower, along with a third electric motor in the rear that delivers an additional 200 hp of its own. Matched with a 25 kilowatt battery that's submerged in oil to maintain ideal cell temperatures and molded into the underside of the Tourbillon's carbon fiber monocoque, Bugatti's latest hypercar dishes out a healthy 800 horsepower sheerly through electric propulsion. It also allows the Tourbillon to go all-electric for an estimated 37 miles.\n\nThen there's the engine, a 64-valve, naturally aspirated 8.3-liter V16. The V is not a typo we intended to be a W. The all-new mill with the more common cylinder formation than those of its W16 predecessors delivers another 1,000 horsepower of its own without the aid of forced induction, allowing it to rev out to a soaring 9,000-rpm redline and sound absolutely incredible while doing so. Total system output is 1,800 horsepower.\n\n\"We've stayed true to our origins,\" Heyl said in reference to the cylinder count. \"I like to say that it's the same band of 16, just regrouped in a different format.\"\n\nFour individual throttle bodies serve four cylinders apiece, and in its V configuration, the new engine required a crankshaft that's more than 3 feet long. That would normally be a recipe for unruly NVH, but Heyl noted that Bugatti was able to smoothen things out with extensive computer simulation and materials testing. \"Since you can ignite four cylinders simultaneously, the vibrations are essentially nullified by one another,\" he explained. \"And that allowed us to keep the (crankshaft's) counterbalancing weights to a minimum.\" Think of it as noise canceling technology for your 1,000-horsepower V16.\n\nHeyl might not want to harp on the numbers, but there are certainly a few worth noting. Outfitted with a new eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox that sends power to all four wheels, the Tourbillon is capable of reaching 124 mph from a standstill in less than 5 seconds on its way to a top speed of 277 mph. The former figure puts the Tourbillon roughly on par with the Nevera in terms of face-melting quickness, while the latter gives it an edge of about 20 mph. It's worth noting that the Tourbillon's vMax stat is still shy of the Chiron Super Sport's 304.7-mph top speed, leaving room for a potential Super Sport iteration of its own a few years down the line.\n\nBugatti Tourbillon interior from driver View 9 Photos\n\nDuring our briefing, Heyl compared the shape of the Tourbillon to that of a falcon. While the design isn't a massive departure from the Chiron overall, it doesn't take much imagination to see the resemblance at the beak nose of the car.\n\n\"We like to say that beauty comes from the aesthetic of purpose, and the purpose here is performance.\"\n\nThe falcon analogy mainly correlates to the Tourbillon's reduced frontal area versus its predecessors, a change which significantly reduces aerodynamic drag. That, in turn, allows for even more rapid acceleration as wind resistance increases alongside the pace while also helping the hypercar achieve aerodynamic neutrality at top speed.\n\nLike its predecessors, the Tourbillon eschews large screens in favor of finely crafted instrumentation and physical switchgear. To ensure that it could keep up with the manic powertrain, Bugatti turned to the medical industry for the stepper motors that move the horsepower gauge's needle, while the use of sapphire, titanium, and crystal glass in the gauge cluster was inspired by high-end watch design. A retractable digital display does hide at the top of the center stack, but Heyl noted that all of the car's functions are accessible without it. It's a design ethos that's intended to keep these cars from feeling dated decades from now, as he expects the Tourbillon to be enjoyed by owners well into the future, regardless of the next contender's headline-grabbing stats.\n\n\"I think we've reached a point where cars are so incredibly fast that it's not the differentiator anymore. It's about the emotions that it generates. Your heart has to tell your brain that it's a good decision to buy this car.\"\n\nBugatti Information All Bugatti Models For Sale Rebates & Incentives News & Reviews Photos & Videos More Bugatti Information Featured Gallery Bugatti Tourbillon View 32 Photos", "source": {"uri": "autoblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Autoblog"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_(engine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cylinder (engine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Nevera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Nevera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luxury car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_Rimac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mate Rimac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vibration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise,_vibration,_and_harshness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise, vibration, and harshness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_boat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric boat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2024/06/18164907/Bugatti-Tourbillon-front-three-quarter-high.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

We've also included the numbers set by the 1,888 hp (1,914 PS) quad-motor Rimac Nevera EV during its marathon record-breaking frenzy last year.\n\nThe Tourbillon is clearly massively faster in terms of acceleration than every one of the Chirons, but until Bugatti drops the 'less than' prefix on some of those numbers, we won't know how closely it matches (or possibly beats) the Nevera, whose creator, Rimac, now owns Bugatti.\n\nWe don't yet know if the rate of acceleration shown in the CGI video is true, or if it's been sped up for effect, but if it is accurate the 0-249 mph time would be more like 16 seconds than 'less than' 25 seconds, and that really would be a shocker.\n\nTop speed? Bugatti quotes 236 mph (380 km/h) unless the 'speed key' is inserted, which lifts the vmax to 277 mph (445 km/h), making it faster than the every Chiron bar the Super Sport 300+. But bear in mind that the 277 mph top end is still electronically limited.\n\nInterestingly the Chiron reached its VMAX in top gear (seventh), but the Tourbillon registers 277 mph just before the rev limiter kick in at the top of sixth in the video, with two gears still available. We're not suggesting that it could redline in eighth, but it seems like the Tourbillon has plenty left in the tank.\n\nTwo more things we noticed are how the smaller needle on the right hand gauge shows the electric power coming in and out until gone 162 mph (260 kmh) when it stays engaged for good, and that while you can see both the battery- and fuel levels drop (two of the three dials on the left), neither is drained as badly as you'd expect given the laws of physics the powertrain has been asked to bend.", "source": {"uri": "carscoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carscoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_chilton@carscoops.com", "name": "Chris Chilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Nevera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Nevera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_brake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parking brake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gear"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/HP_3000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/HP 3000", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Sports", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-fast.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Though it defies the marque's recent tradition of naming its vehicles after notable drivers from its history, the moniker makes sense. Not just because a tourbillon is an exquisite mechanical object crafted to precise tolerances, or because it is, like the brand, a French invention, but because one can't spell it without the word Billion, and that net worth is the price of entry for Bugatti owners. (Bullion also works.)\n\nThe car's stats are impressive. Gone is the lunatic quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine that powered the Tourbillon's predecessors, the Chiron and Veyron (and all their variants) in outputs ranging from 1000 to 1578 horsepower. It has been replaced by an even more outrageous powertrain: a naturally-aspirated, 1000-hp 8.3-liter V-16, combined with an 800-hp trio of electric motors, two driving the front wheels and one helping out the ICE amidship on the rears. Though Bugatti claims that, having crested the 300 mph barrier, chasing top speed records is now gauche, acceleration and V-max should be virulent enough to provide temporary supplemental facelifts for its clients, keeping the rattles out of their wattles.\n\nBut now that scorching off-the-line performance is available to anyone with enough lithium-ion cells -- or a contract with Rimac Technologies, the electric go-fast subsidiary of Rimac Automobili, the Croatian battery-powered supercar manufacturer that Bugatti merged with a few years back -- a Bugatti must provide something more. It must provide an experience, an occasion, enduring delight.\n\nOur favorite features in the new car do just this. Read on to find out what we mean.\n\nInstrument Panel: We're not sure which came first, the car's name or the design of this instrument panel, but Bugatti has taken the whole Tourbillon experience to the next level, with a set of gauges constructed with the same precision and aesthetic as the movement in a fine Swiss watch. Its titanium, sapphire, and ruby mechanisms perform an analog ballet. So in order to provide owners with the best possible view of their needles' sweep, Bugatti has designed a fixed hub steering wheel, the spokes of which connect to the column behind the \"skeletonized cluster.\"\n\nThus, no matter where one is in the wheel's rotation, the lovely gauges are always visible. We're particularly fond of the central tachometer-inside-the-speedometer setup, as it reminds us of a similar layout on the first-generation Honda Prelude.\n\n(Almost) No Screens: Praise Carrus -- the jackal-headed, Olympic gymnast-bodied god of automobiles! Bugatti is running counter to the heinous automotive trend of metastasizing LCD screens. This contrarian position extends beyond the aforementioned analog instrument cluster, to the entire cabin. Screens have been banished, in favor of a center console made of a single piece of billet aluminum, impregnated with glass crystal and knurled aluminum switchgear. Knobs and hard buttons here and on the steering wheel control oft-used features like adjusting the HVAC, entertainment volume, traction control, and drive modes.\n\nLuxury automakers of the world, take note! For those of you who cannot live with a screen, a tiny one, about the size of a phone, is completely hidden within the dash. It rises out of there automatically in just two seconds to serve as a mandatory backup camera, in portrait mode, when one shifts into reverse; and it can be called up in five seconds, at the touch of a button, in full landscape mode for Apple CarPlay features.\n\nWeight: With ever-increasing customer demands for additional performance, comfort, and interior space, cars tend to gain weight generation over generation. When a complex electrified powertrain is added, this gain can be a step-change above previous models. At over two tons, the outgoing Bugatti Chiron was no featherweight. But despite adding three electric motors and a 24.8-kWh battery, and upsizing the engine, cabin, and cargo capacity, the Tourbillon weighs less than the Chiron. This magic was accomplished through a variety of techniques: carbon composite construction, using the battery as a structural member, making frames out of thin-wall aluminum castings, and 3D-printing the structural braces along with suspension and airfoil components. Bugatti even light-weighted the monster engine, which weighs \"only\" 555 pounds in contrast to the nearly 900-pound weight of the outgoing W16. We wonder if, combined, these 32-cylinder pair weigh more or less than the 12.8-liter straight-8 that powered the brand's Type 41 Royale in the 1930s.\n\nFrunk: The Veyron and Chiron were not known for their interior storage, so for long trips, owners typically outsourced banal physical acts like carrying bags to sherpas or other servants, who likely followed on foot, or in a fleet of Mercedes Sprinter vans. The Chiron's frontal storage area was famously sized to fit a briefcase. A wider front track, along with a cooling system that ducts air through and out of the hood, affords a frunk between the twin front radiators, large enough for a set of bespoke Tourbillon luggage. We would spec it to match our interior, of course.\n\nStartup: Starting a vintage Bugatti is a time consuming experience. But it is just that, an experience, a memorable event. The simple twisting of a key, or pushing of a button -- even if it's covered in a protective flip-up flap, like a fighter jet -- isn't enough of an occasion for a vehicle of this caliber. Bugatti has solved that by incorporating a new iteration of an old technology: an ignition pull. Like on a Duesenberg SSJ, you pull it out to start the motor. Unlike a Duesenberg SSJ, it's made of crystal and aluminum. Also unlike a Duesenberg SSJ, you push it in to stop.", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facelift_(automotive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facelift (automotive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering tolerance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lithium-ion battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duesenberg", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duesenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/e46d5a08e71009e420cb5b6084df6972.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Aristocratic, artistic, and more than a little arcane, Bugatti was a prewar marque that mastered luxury, design, and motorsport, the creator of Grand Prix winners, and arguably the most lavish motorcar ever made, in the shape of the early 1930s Type 41 Royale. Then it faded away.\n\nIt was the late Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, the monomaniacal kingpin of the Volkswagen Group, who bought the rights to the name and returned the brand to glory with 2005's Veyron and its successor, the Chiron. The Super Sport version of the latter remains the world's fastest production car, having achieved a top speed of 304.773 mph in the hands of racing driver Andy Wallace at a German test track in 2019.\n\nHow do you follow that -- especially in a world in which 2,000-horsepower electric hypercars have comprehensively rearranged expectations?\n\nAs fate would have it, Bugatti is now controlled by Croatian EV powerhouse Rimac, as a result of a complex 2021 contra-deal with VW and Porsche. So you'd be right to wonder what kind of encore wunderkind Mate Rimac would devise for the 114-year-old French legend.\n\nThe result is the Tourbillon, an imperious super-coup\u00e9 hybrid that sees Bugatti looking a hundred years ahead as much as it's invoking its storied past -- but not in the ways you'd expect.\n\n\"Icons like the Type 57SC Atlantic, renowned as the most beautiful car in the world, the Type 35, the most successful racing car ever, and the Type 41 Royale, one of the most ambitious luxury cars of all time, provide our three pillars of inspiration,\" Rimac says. \"Beauty, performance, and luxury formed the blueprint for the Tourbillon; a car that was more elegant, more emotive, and more luxurious than anything before it. And just like those icons of the past, it wouldn't be simply for the present, or even for the future, but pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9-for eternity.\"\n\nYep, it's safe to say Bugatti is pretty excited about it's new creation and has an eye on the pristine lawns of the Pebble Beach or Villa d'Este concours events a century hence, positioning its new hypercar as both head-spinningly high-tech and as an artful riposte to built-in obsolescence.\n\nReskinning Rimac's own brilliant and fully electric Nevera hypercar was surely one option, but Rimac is respectful enough of Bugatti's history to know that would never fly. \"So I came up with a proposal to make a completely new car,\" he says. He's come an awfully long way since being the sole employee of Rimac back in 2009.\n\nThe name Tourbillon will be familiar to adherents of haute horologie. Rather than honor a former Bugatti racing driver -- as in Pierre Veyron and Louis Chiron -- the new car references the most elaborate mechanism in watchmaking, a machine for the wrist whose complexity counteracts the effects of gravity in order to maintain the most accurate possible timekeeping.\n\nBugatti's designers and engineers were seduced by the idea of mechanical timelessness when they were conceiving the new car, and thus the Tourbillon largely rejects large digital touchscreens in its interior in favor of machined components and a fully analogue skeletonized (another watch world reference) instrument cluster -- though a small screen does slide into view if you want it, for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nThe cluster consists of more than 600 parts, uses titanium, sapphire, and ruby in its construction, and remains fixed in place allowing the steering wheel to rotate around it. Two needles on the center dial display the engine's revs and speed. On the left are analogue readouts for battery and oil temperature; on the right there's a display showing the power drawn from the e-motors and engine.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType":

Chiron. Tourbillon. Bugatti is no stranger to seemingly eccentric nameplates. When the company was acquired by Volkswagen Group in 1998, Bugatti immediately cracked open the history books to come up with suitable names for its first two hypercars.\n\nFor the Veyron, the company landed on racing driver Pierre Veyron, who piloted a Bugatti to a win at the 1939 24 Hours of Le Mans. It did the same for the Chiron, naming it after Louis Chiron, who won the 1931 French Grand Prix behind the wheel of a Type 51. And many of the iterations that followed had similar historical ties.\n\nBut the new Bugatti Tourbillon isn't named after a racing driver at all, bucking the trend of the first two models. There was no Jim Tourbillon who raced Bugattis at the turn of the century. Since this is the first Bugatti in 20 years not powered by a W-16, the company felt this new model deserved an entirely new name -- one that has nothing to do with Bugatti's lineage.\n\nSo where exactly does the name Tourbillon come from?\n\nThe name Tourbillon originates from late 1700s watchmaking. Tourbillon is French for \"whirlwind\" or \"whirlpool,\" and it's a specific mechanism used in high-end timepieces to eliminate timekeeping inconsistencies caused by gravity. When you wear a watch on your wrist, the watch's movement keeps better or worse time depending on its position in space. By constantly rotating a watch's escapement and balance wheel (the rapidly moving bits of a mechanical watch) in a cage-like structure, you can average out these inconsistencies for more accurate timekeeping overall.\n\nIn short, a tourbillon essentially fights the effects of gravity -- an apt description for a hypercar that does much of the same.\n\nThe tourbillon was invented in 1795 by a sort-of-Swiss, sort-of-French, sort-of-Prussian watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet, who essentially spent his working life in France, inventing every major breakthrough in modern timekeeping. By the end of his life, Breguet would become the most important figure in all of modern horology.\n\nHe patented the tourbillon in 1801, a significant but fractional sliver of his legacy.\n\nIn 1920, Alfred Helwig invented the flying tourbillon -- which removed the bridge (similar to an automotive crossmember) that supports the tourbillon, exposing the tourbillon's rotating mechanism for aesthetic purposes. And in 1947, the brand Omega created the first tourbillon wristwatch -- the 30i Tourbillon -- a rare timepiece that has sold for more than $1.5 million at auction.\n\nSo why did Bugatti decide on this name? Apart from it sounding cool (which it does) and keeping the traditional \"on\" suffixes of the Veyron and Chiron before it, Bugatti wanted to go in a new direction that better integrates \"modern fashion and lifestyle\" into its new supercar. In fact, Bugatti already offers a tourbillon timepiece.\n\n\"The name Tourbillon was chosen as the perfect encapsulation of this car's character,\" the company notes. \"A completely original creation without compare, it is both complex and beautiful, helping to counteract the effects of gravity on a watch to ensure more consistent time-keeping. And over 200 years later it is still revered as the pinnacle of watchmaking.\"\n\nWith that in mind, the Bugatti Tourbillon has several not-so-subtle touches paying tribute to its timepiece-inspired name. The gauges were designed with the help of Swiss watchmakers to a maximum tolerance of 50 microns -- with some details toleranced to as little as 5 microns. And more than 600 titanium pieces make up the unique three-tier structure just above the steering wheel, with gemstones like sapphires and rubies subtly embedded into the face of each cluster. The entire thing weighs just 1.5 pounds.\n\nThe center console comprises crystal glass developed over 13 separate stages to ensure maximum clarity. The aluminum fixtures were anodized and milled from a single piece of metal. Even the pull-to-start knob -- a nod to classic Bugattis -- was milled from the same piece of aluminum.\n\nIf this represents a next step for Bugatti, watchmaking's crown jewel bestows a fitting name for the occasion.", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Chiron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louis Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Veyron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Type_51", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Type 51"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watchmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "24 Hours of Le Mans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breguet_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breguet (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham-Louis_Breguet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham-Louis Breguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Escapement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_(clockwork)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Movement (clockwork)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_SA", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omega SA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sapphire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/NGemgM/s3/bugatti-tourbillon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Here's How", "body": "The Bugatti Tourbillon costs right around $4 million. Just by looking at it, you can tell why. The instrument cluster is akin to finely tuned mechanical clockwork, the carbon fiber bodywork offers typical Bugatti beauty, and under the skin, the drivetrain completes the picture. Its 8.3-liter naturally-aspirated V-16 produces 1,000 horsepower, more than most supercars. Its electric drivetrain produces 800 hp, more than most performance EVs.\n\nEven with both of these systems combined in the same car, the Tourbillon is lighter and more powerful than the outgoing Chiron. How is that possible?\n\nThere's no escaping battery weight. Hybrid performance cars solve this problem in a variety of ways. The Corvette E-Ray and new Porsche 911 GTS hybrid use a small but power-dense battery that can deliver high power at the cost of total capacity. The Bugatti Tourbillon takes this route too, but in a slightly different manner. Its 800-volt, 25.0-kilowatt-hour pack is relatively large in terms of capacity, but it's very powerful for its size and unique in its cooling method. The rest of the car is full of tricks, too.\n\nMost electric vehicles use dedicated cooling channels to sap heat away from the individual cells. Bugatti uses direct cell cooling as a lighter alternative. This system circulates a dielectric fluid around the battery without any dedicated channels. Exact details of this system are still murky, but we know it's possible with smaller-volume packs. We've seen it before on vehicles like the all-electric Caterham Seven concept unveiled earlier this year.\n\nThe motors are also a key part of the puzzle. It's unclear what their topology is -- axial flux or radial flux -- but in any case, they're impressive. Including the inverters and reduction gear, it's claimed they offer a power density of 6kw/kg. For reference, many electric motors on their own -- without the inverter or gearbox -- cannot achieve this figure.\n\nIntegrating the rear motor into the transmission would also eliminate the need for a dedicated motor reduction gear, but Bugatti doesn't specify exactly how it's all put together back there.\n\nThe V-16 engine compensates for the hybrid system's mass as well. Naturally aspirated, it does away with the quad turbochargers of the old W-16 in the Veyron and Chiron. Without the need for all of the associated plumbing and intercoolers, it weighs just 555 pounds. According to Bugatti, the Chiron's W-16 weighed between 882 lbs and 961 lbs, depending on the trim.\n\nThe rest of the not-so-secret sauce is the chassis construction. Its battery pack is a structural member of the carbon fiber monocoque, the front and rear subframes are thin wall aluminum castings, and many other components, sprung and unsprung, are 3D-printed aluminum. The brakes are also carbon ceramic, which takes a lot of mass out of the corners. Even the jewelry-like gauge cluster has a number of components made from lightweight titanium.\n\nWhen examined at length, it's easy to believe how, despite its powerful hybrid system, the Tourbillon comes out lighter than the old Chiron. Just the engine's reduced weight is a huge savings, and when combined with the army of other mass-shedding details, it's no wonder the new world-standard for hypercars comes out ahead by leaving weight behind.", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Performance car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche 911"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gear train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterham_7", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caterham 7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_density", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dielectric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_inverter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power inverter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Accessories", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/6ZQ3J7/s3/bugatti-tourbillon-and-chiron.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Bugatti has unveiled the Tourbillon, the long-awaited successor to the Chiron, with a gasoline-electric drivetrain rated at 1,800 horsepower, 3D-printed parts in the suspension, and an unusual sound system that has no speakers.\n\nBugatti developed the Tourbillon on a blank slate. The big coupe's proportions are relatively close to the Chiron's because the two cars need to fulfill a similar mission: cruise safely and comfortably at jaw-dropping speeds. Bugatti hints that hitting 250-plus-mph is well within the Tourbillon's scope of capabilities. For context, the Chiron set a speed record and became the first car to break the 300-mph barrier when it reached 304 mph in 2019, so the brand knows a thing or two about speed.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPush a button on the key fob and the Tourbillon opens its dihedral doors like a bird of prey preparing to fly away. Inside, Bugatti focused on craftsmanship instead of festooning the interior with wall-to-wall screens. \"Since car manufacturers began to embrace digital screens and touchscreens, the rate of progress has been so rapid that within less than a decade, the technology appears outdated,\" the company said. In contrast, it wants to make timeless cars that will look good for decades to come. The difference between a new Apple Watch and a vintage high-end Swiss watch comes to mind here.\n\nOur watchmaking analogy isn't as random as it seems. Bugatti consulted Swiss watchmakers to create an instrument cluster built with over 600 parts. It's made with titanium, as well as gemstones like sapphire and ruby, and it's positioned in front of the steering wheel spokes for better visibility.\n\nThe brand couldn't fully avoid screens, however. There's one Apple CarPlay-compatible screen in the entire cabin, and it's hidden in the top part of the center stack unless the driver summons it. As for the sound system, it's there, but it's likely not what you have in mind. Instead of speakers, Bugatti integrated exciters throughout the car in order to use the interior panels as speakers. This solution saves weight -- and it's a really cool piece of technology. Bugatti wisely decided not to reinvent the volume knob: it's at the top of the aluminum center stack and it works just like you'd expect it to.\n\n\"Hybrid\" wasn't a very sexy word 20 years ago, when Toyota was selling the original Prius, but the technology has gone through significant evolutions since. Power for the Tourbillon comes from a plug-in hybrid drivetrain that bundles a new 8.3-liter V16 engine, a pair of front-mounted electric motors (one per wheel), a third electric motor assigned to the rear axle, and a 25-kilowatt-hour oil-cooled battery pack. The 16-cylinder engine makes 1,000 horsepower, while the motors are rated at a combined 800 horsepower, which brings the Tourbillon's total output to 1,800 horsepower. The engine is linked to an eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, while the T-shaped battery pack is split between the tunnel that runs through the cabin and the space behind the seats.\n\nThis system delivers through-the-road all-wheel-drive, full torque vectoring, and the ability to drive on electricity alone for nearly 40 miles. And, while hybrid technology normally adds weight, Bugatti pulled off the seemingly impossible task of making the Tourbillon lighter than the Chiron, its non-electrified predecessor. Weight-saving innovations, such as a structure made with carbon composite and suspension parts made using 3D-printed aluminum, helped offset the hybrid system's mass.\n\nHand-built in Molsheim, France, the Bugatti Tourbillon is limited to 250 units.

The first road car with over 1,000 PS had some specification highlights to offer. 20 years later, people have more or less got used to the four-digit mark.\n\nAnd yet, when Bugatti comes up with something new, everyone looks towards the luxury brand with piqued interest. And it delivers with the Bugatti Tourbillon, pronounced \"Tuhrbilljong\" (an expression from the watch industry). At first glance, it hardly looks any different from its predecessor, the Chiron. One is spontaneously reminded of the \"new\" BMW 1 Series or the \"new\" Mini five-door.\n\nNevertheless, W16 becomes V16 and the new hybrid drivetrain generates insane additional driving characteristics that are supposed to catapult the freshly put on wheels work of art up to 277 mph. Provided you have a \"speed key\".\n\nIn this case, you can exceed the actually limited top speed of 236 mph. From zero to 249 mph in 25 seconds, 186 mph in ten seconds and 124 mph in just five seconds. At best, with these driving characteristics, hopefully you haven't eaten too much beforehand.\n\nThe new 8.3-litre V16 produces 1,000 PS and 900 Nm of torque. This is joined by two electric 340 PS motors with 3,000 Nm of torque at the front and one with 240 Nm at the rear. In total, the system offers a concentrated 1,800 PS with a vehicle weight of 1,995 kilograms. In other words, almost one PS per kilogramme.\n\nAn 8-speed DCT transmission with electronic limited slip differential ensures that the sheer power is transferred to the road in a sensible manner. Massive 345/30 R21 wheels at the rear and 285/35 R20 at the front are designed to help with this. According to the WLTP, the new bullet can drive 37 miles completely electrically. An oil-cooled 800-volt 25-kWh battery is also on board.\n\nIn addition to the W16, the tradition of naming the core models after legendary Bugatti racing drivers of the past continues. The name Tourbillon is a subtle reference to Bugatti's French heritage and is intended to perfectly reflect the character of the vehicle. Since 1801, the tourbillon has been used to compensate for the effects of gravity on a watch in order to ensure consistent timekeeping.\n\nA timeless invention whose character the new Bugatti also wants to appropriate. The tourbillon echoes the face of the Chiron at the front. Only tentative stylistic and aerodynamic changes are recognisable. At the rear, the curved silhouette of the light strip with framed illuminated Bugatti lettering is particularly striking. Three massive fins extend across the roof to the rear.\n\nEvery design and every proportion has been subordinated to performance on a completely new chassis, making driving at speeds of over 250 mph possible in the first place. The rear wing even remains retracted at high speeds. It only provides more downforce at lower speeds and improved stability when braking.\n\nInside, the centrepiece is the instrument cluster, which was also designed with the expertise of Swiss watchmakers and manufactured from more than 600 parts made of titanium and precious stones such as sapphire and ruby. The centre console is made of crystal glass and aluminium. And bucking the trend, the only screen in the car is completely invisible.\n\nUnless you want to see it. Then the touchscreen unfolds from the top of the centre console in portrait mode within two seconds, for example for the reversing camera. In landscape mode, the whole procedure takes five seconds.\n\nThe tourbillon is now entering the test phase, with prototypes already on the road. So keep your eyes and ears open. That unidentifiable short noise could have just been a Chiron successor. Deliveries of the 250 units are scheduled to start in 2026. Cost point: \u20ac3.8 million (approx. \u00a33.2 million) upwards.

The structure is built with tolerances of 5 to 50 microns, or 0.0002 to 0.002 inches, and the back is just as delicate, with a brace supporting the central screen.\n\nThe central dial has the speedometer and rpm indicator, with a small digital display at the bottom for the speed and gear selection. The two dials move like the hands of a clock. On the left are temperature, fuel, and battery gauges. The right dial contains the power indicator for the car's 1,800-horsepower, 8.3-liter hybrid V-16 engine.\n\nBugatti ensures the driver can always see the gauges by designing the steering wheel with a fixed hub.

The automaker's new Tourbillon is lighter, more powerful and far faster than the hardly-slow hypercar it replaces, plus it's got the coolest gauge cluster we've seen.\n\nWe can dig into the design and details later, but let's get into the engine first, and what it can do. Because this is one engine you're going to want to know about, and hear in action. Bugatti has junked the 8.0-liter W16 that in various forms has powered every model since the Veyron rebooted the storied brand in 2004. In its place comes an 8.3-liter naturally-aspirated Cosworth-designed V16 that spins to 9,000 rpm.\n\nRelated: Bugatti Says It'll Build A Gas Station At Your House If It Has To\n\nThe electric experts at Rimac, who took control of Bugatti in 2021, decided against going full-EV with the Tourbillon, but they have used their know-how to create a three-motor hybrid setup that almost doubles the overall horse count and delivers a 37-mile (60 km) electric-only range.\n\nThe V16 alone makes a mighty 986 hp (1,000 hp), virtually matching the output of the original Veyron's W16 (987 hp / 1,001 PS), but does it without the help of four turbos. What was enough 20 years ago is Little League today, though, so the Tourbillon's hybrid system tops that up to the tune of 789 hp (800 PS).\n\nAnd unlike previous modern-era Bugattis this is one that really can sing. The old W16 cars were great at bending physics, but sounded pretty dull. The new V16 makes a noise like a nitrous-injected chainsaw as it chews through revs on its way to generating a total of 1,775 hp (1,800 PS) and an unspecified, but presumably enormous, amount of torque.\n\nThat's not a huge leap over the 1,479 hp (1,500 PS) generated by the regular Chiron or 1,578 hp (1,600 PS) of the Chiron Super Sport. But the performance figures show that Bugatti has definitely moved the game on.\n\nHow fast?!\n\nAccording to Bugatti's official data the Tourbillon is 0.4 seconds faster to 62 mph (100 kmh) than the original Chiron, getting there in 2 seconds dead. But at that point it's only just getting into its stride. By 186 mph (300 kmh,) which it reaches in 'less than' 10 seconds, or roughly the same time an ordinary small SUV needs to hit 60 mph, it's pulled out a 3-4-second gap on its predecessor.\n\nAnd from there things just get silly, the Tourbillon hitting 248 mph (400 kmh) in 'less than' 25 seconds. The Chiron needed 32.6 seconds to do the same, and even Rimac's record-breaking Nevera asks 28.6 seconds. You can hear the Tourbillon pull through the gears in the video of the gauge cluster below, and unless Bugatti has sped up the footage, it looks like the official numbers are very conservative.\n\nThe default top speed is 236 mph (380 kmh), the same the Chiron achieved, but while inserting the second 'speed key' into the older car upped the limiter to 261 mph (420 kmh), doing the same in the Tourbillon will let the speed run on to 277 mph (445 kmh).\n\nHypercar meets horology\n\nThose huge speeds are displayed on a stunning gauge cluster that looks like something dreamed up by a watch fanatic with a passion for early 1990s superbikes, and helps explain the name of Bugatti's new car. A tourbillon is a device invented in 1801 that's still added to seriously high-end timepieces, including the $170k+ optional clock in the Bentley Bentayga, to increase accuracy.\n\nThe Bugatti doesn't actually appear to have a tourbillon clock, but what matters here is the statement it's making about technology that lasts. While every other automaker, including Porsche is jumping on the trend for fully digital dashboards that look great now, but will look embarrassingly outdated - if they still work at all - in 30 years, Bugatti is trying to create something timeless.\n\nWhich is why the five-dial gauge cluster, whose combined speedo-tacho focal point sits alongside a power dial showing both ICE and electric outputs, is an almost entirely anolog affair. The sole concession to our digital age is a small speed display at the base of the binnacle.\n\nSecret screen\n\nBut hit reverse in the eight-speed dual-clutch transmission and in two seconds a portrait screen emerges from the top of the dash to show what's happening behind you. Or you can summon it independently and, in five seconds, you have a conventional landscape display with full Apple CarPlay access.\n\nThe rest of the interior, looks much like the Chiron's but features some very neat details. One is the knob on the console that you use to fire up the Tourbillon that tips a hat to early 20th century classics. Tugging on it fires up the V16, and pushing it kills it. The electrically adjustable pedal box (the seats are fixed) is another highlight, but easily the most interesting is the steering wheel.\n\nLike the one on BMW's recent Neue Klasse X SUV concept, it has two spokes mounted at 6- and 12 o'clock. But what really makes it unusual is the fixed hub and the fact that the spokes are mounted behind the gauge pack, meaning the Bugatti 'B' always remains upright, and the driver's view of the instruments is never blocked by the spokes.\n\nMore different than it looks\n\nWe've left the exterior until last because, well, you can look at the pictures and make your own mind up about whether you like it or not. And because, in our opinion, while handsome, and an elegant evolution in the mould of Porsche 911 updates, it doesn't quite move the game on in the way the engine and interior detail does.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't some nice surprises here. The doors are now of the dihedral kind, rather than opening like a boring sedan's, adding some much needed curbside theater, and feature a Miura-esque (or is it Skoda Yeti?) upward flick at the B-pillar. And the spine that runs from the nose to tail is now more pronounced, and includes a windshield wiper positioned dead-center, like a Le Mans car's.\n\nThe horseshoe snout is also exaggerated, borrowing from the W16 Mistral by way of a cold war fighter jet and a railway tunnel, and the Bugatti name on the tail is illuminated and incorporated into the segmented strip of LED lights that follows the upper contour of the tail. A tail that will look suspiciously familiar to anyone who's ogled the ass-end of a McLaren P1.\n\nLighter than a Chiron\n\nEven the P1 didn't pack a rear diffuser this big, but then the Tourbillon needs some serious ground-effects tech to keep it stable at its high speed because the active wing remains flush with the body during high speed runs to reduce drag. It only comes out to boost downforce at (comparatively) lower speeds, or to function as an airbrake.\n\nAlthough the design is evolutionary, Bugatti claims the Tourbillon's chassis and body structure is all new. The 25 kWh battery is built into the carbon monocoque, and more diet tricks including making the diffuser part of the crash structure and swapping the steel double wishbones for forged aluminium result in the Tourbillon weighing the same 4,400 lbs (1,995 kg) as the Chiron despite its added hybrid tech.\n\nFewer cars, bigger price\n\nBugatti built 500 Chirons, the final car rolling off the Molsheim line in May, nine years after the car was first revealed in 2015. But the Tourbillon will be twice as rare. Production is limited to 250 units, with testing already underway and the first customers scheduled to get their cars in 2026.\n\nNot that those billionaire customers will likely care, but that exclusivity comes at a price, one that's even more more outrageous than the one attached to the Chiron. Bugatti's departing hypercar cost $3.3 million at the end of its life in the US, but the Tourbillon's \u20ac3.8 million plus taxes Euro price will probably translate to $4.5 million or more by the time it's on your driveway, and that's if you haven't requested any personal touches.\n\nThough they're great to drive and far more nimble than you might imagine, the Chiron and Veyron before it got plenty of hate for being too heavy and not as pure, analog and exciting as less powerful, less expensive supercars. But the Tourbillon fights back. It says no thanks to fashionable digital tech and no thanks to laggy, sound-sapping turbochargers, instead giving us the only naturally-aspirated V16 fitted to any new car.\n\nSome things don't change, through. Show it a stretch of runway and a stopwatch and this Bugatti still blows every single rival into the weeds.", "source": {"uri": "carscoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carscoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_chilton@carscoops.com", "name": "Chris Chilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chiron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "W16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Nevera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Nevera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimac_Automobili", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rimac Automobili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti_Veyron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti Veyron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supercar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolutions per minute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chainsaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley_Bentayga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bentley Bentayga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_bike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport bike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molsheim", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/RC", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/RC", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tourbillon-lead-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8187708566", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-20", "time": "21:06:44", "dateTime": "2024-06-20T21:06:44Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-20T21:05:48Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4431372582912445, "url": "https://www.netcarshow.com/bugatti/2026-tourbillon/", "title": "Bugatti Tourbillon (2026)", "body": "At the heart of the Tourbillon's design ethos is the iconic horseshoe, from which all lines of the car originate, shaping the central fuselage volume. Docked onto that left and right are the flying fenders that allow to stream air underneath the headlights to boost air mass flow into the side intakes. This intricate interplay of airflow is further exemplified by the frontal design, which, while maintaining the dimensions of a sculpted overhang, ingeniously houses an ultra-efficient cooling system that directs air through and out of the front bonnet, augmenting downforce while ingeniously packaging a sizable frunk in between the two radiators.\n\nA set of advanced, electrically actuated dihedral doors not only allow for easy entry into the vehicle but provide a dramatic sense of arrival, able to be opened and closed from the key fob, the door opening button found just underneath the Bugatti Line and on the center console.\n\nINTERIOR\n\nEver since car manufacturers began to embrace digital screens and touchscreens in cars, the rate of progress has been so rapid that within less than a decade, the technology appears outdated. Imagining the Tourbillon on concours d'elegance lawns not just in 10 years but perhaps in 100 years, the design philosophy of the interior focused on timelessness. Inspired by the world of horologie, in which wristwatches over 100 years old can still be worn and used today, integrated into modern fashion and lifestyles seamlessly, the design and engineering teams pioneered an authentic analogue experience in the cabin.\n\nThe centerpiece of this takes the horologie philosophy to its most literal conclusion; an instrument cluster designed and built with the expertise of Swiss watchmakers. Made up of more than 600 parts and constructed from titanium as well as gemstones such as sapphire and ruby, the skeletonized cluster is built to the largest tolerance of 50 microns, with the smallest at 5 microns, and weighs just 700g. This intricately engineered masterpiece remains a focal point of the driving experience, fixed in place as the rim of the steering wheel rotates around it - a set-up known as a fixed hub steering wheel. Through this ingenious concept Tourbillon drivers have an unobstructed view of their instrumentation independent of the steering angle because the spokes reach around the back of the instrument cluster.\n\nThe center console is a blend of crystal glass and aluminum, revealing the intricate workings of the switches and the engine start 'pull' lever that it hosts. This glass was developed over 13 separate stages to ensure it was both perfectly clear and extremely strong and safe in the event of an accident. The aluminum parts of the console are anodized and milled from a single block of metal, while the knurled aluminum switches sit at the head of a complex mechanism that is fully visible beneath the crystal glass - entirely developed in-house. The act of igniting the all-new naturally aspirated V16 engine and electric powertrain has been crafted to be a physical experience, a nod to the rituals of historic automobiles - a pull to start and a push to cease.\n\nBut hidden from view until desired is a high-definition digital screen, which displays vehicle data and offers seamless mobile connection. An intricately engineered mechanism deploys the touchscreen from the top of the center console; portrait mode for the reversing camera in just two seconds and full landscape mode in five seconds.\n\nEvery interior decision - just as it is with the exterior - is made with ultimate performance in mind, without compromising in any way on practicality or comfort. The seats, for example, are fixed to the floor to be as light and as low as they can possibly be, the pedal box can be electrically adjusted forwards and backwards to ensure a comfortable driving position for everyone. Thanks to this new solution, the interior is spacious, making it ideal for longer trips and daily use. Even the audio system is being engineered without traditional speakers and woofers, opting for an advanced system that features exciters on the door panels and throughout the car to use existing interior panels as speakers. It is a lighter and more efficient system than traditional audio set-ups.\n\nPOWERTRAIN AND PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Bugatti W16 engine was unlike any other automotive engine in the world when it was revealed. With its four turbos and prodigious power figures, it set a new benchmark for the limits of combustion engine technology, and two decades after its creation it's still unmatched or replicated. Following in its footsteps is another incomparable masterpiece of internal combustion engineering, paired with the immediate torque and flexibility of electric motors.\n\nThis next-generation Bugatti hyper sports car is powered by an all-new 8.3-liter naturally aspirated V16 engine - engineered with the help of Cosworth - paired with a front e-Axle with two electric motors and one electric motor mounted at the rear axle. In total, the Tourbillon produces 1,800 hp with 1,000 from the combustion engine itself and 800 hp from the electric motors. It's an extraordinary achievement - delivered thanks to a host of cutting-edge materials and technology - given the Veyron achieved 1,001 hp from its 8.0- liter capacity engine with four turbochargers, and the new V16 is completely naturally aspirated. Constructed from lightweight materials, the engine weighs just 252 kg.\n\nThe electric motors are powered by a 25 kWh oil-cooled 800V battery housed in the central tunnel and behind the passengers. With four-wheel-drive and full torque-vectoring, it offers ultimate traction and agility. The front e-axle houses two electric motors, with a further motor on the rear axle, for a total of 800 hp from the electric powertrain system. The electric powertrain, with the electric motors spinning up to 24,000 RPM and a fully integrated dual silicon-carbide inverter, is amongst the most power-dense in the world. The e-axles are delivering over 6 kW per kg of e-axle mass, including inverters, motors and gearboxes. While power, throttle response and torque-fill are priorities for the electric powertrain, the relatively large energy content of 25 kWh allows for a very usable allelectric range of more than 60 km / 37 miles.\n\nIn the automotive industry, it is expected that each new model is heavier than its predecessor. Especially in case the new model adds a hybrid powertrain or more performance. But with a new Bugatti, the unexpected should be the norm. The Tourbillon boasts significantly improved performance, a very powerful electric powertrain system, a large battery pack and yet, it weighs less than the Chiron, which is a testament to the incredible engineering behind the Tourbillon. With its lightweight construction and instantaneous torque from the electric motors, the Bugatti Tourbillon delivers extraordinary performance.\n\nThanks to the combination of an extremely advanced hybrid powertrain and lightweight engineering, efficient packaging and advanced aerodynamics, the Tourbillon will be reducing significantly the emissions in comparison to its predecessor but still enhancing the driving experience and bringing to new levels the pinnacle of automotive industry.\n\nENGINEERING\n\nThe Tourbillon is designed around entirely new chassis and body structure. The structure is made from a next-generation T800 carbon composite, which incorporates a number of weight-saving innovations, such as integrating the battery as a structural part of the monocoque and an unprecedented crash composite rear diffuser, inspired by top level motorsport. The front composite airducts that flow through the front of the car are also integral to the structure, ensuring that each and every part of the rigid, lightweight structure is optimized. For example, the front and rear frames exhibit low pressure thin wall aluminum casting and 3D printed structural braces, contributing to a structure that is significantly lighter and stiffer than its predecessor!\n\nThe completely new chassis integrates multi-link suspension front and rear, forged from aluminum, moving on from the double wishbone steel construction found in the Chiron. By opting for a new organic-designed suspension arm and upright, 3D-printed in aluminum, engineers have saved 45% in suspension weight compared with the Chiron. The rear also features an AI-developed 3D-printed hollow airfoil arm to enhance vehicle dynamics and aerodynamic performance.\n\nThe brakes are equally advanced, featuring the ultimate carboceramic technology. A bespoke brake-by-wire system is introduced, fully integrated with the moveable pedal box, and blended seamlessly through an integrated vehicle non-linear controller developed by Bugatti to the hybrid powertrain. Michelin Pilot Cup Sport 2 tires - 285/35 R20 at the front and 345/30 R21 at the rear - are a bespoke development for the Tourbillon.\n\nWithin the new chassis, the new ultra compact and lightweight front e-axle with dual independent motors, including the dual-inverter, fits within the same package space that was available in Chiron, adding more complexity without requiring more space. Designers and engineers also freed up more storage space and a larger luggage component, as part of the clean-sheet chassis and bodyshell design, allowing owners to fit a set of bespoke Bugatti Tourbillon luggage.\n\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon now enters its testing phase, with prototypes already on the road in anticipation for customer deliveries in 2026. A total of 250 examples will be built, with a starting price of 3.8m EUR net. Hand-assembly will take place at the Bugatti Atelier in Molsheim, following the final W16-powered Bugatti models, Bolide and W16 Mistral.", "source": {"uri": "netcarshow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NetCarShow.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourbillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_console_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Center console (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lead glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V16_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "V16 engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugatti", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bugatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Micrometre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_aspirated_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naturally aspirated engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_angle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caster angle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instrumentation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sapphire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosworth", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molsheim", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Molsheim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.netcarshow.com/Bugatti-Tourbillon-2026-wallpaper.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664186", "eventUri": "eng-9664186", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

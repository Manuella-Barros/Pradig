{"id": 231272214, "title": "Costly US Sugar Tariffs Drive Candy Makers Over the Border to Canada", "text": "A cheaper sugar price is \u201cthe main difference\u201d between having operations in Canada and the US, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any secret sauce there.\u201d To be sure, sugar isn\u2019t the only input cost for manufacturing. John Boyd, the founder of a consultancy that helps companies select site locations, also points to Canada\u2019s labor force, energy costs and exchange rate as factors to consider. And not all of the sugar and candy being produced in Canada is flowing into the US. Canada\u2019s population has been steadily rising, with the country on track to consume in the 2024-2025 marketing year the most sugar in records going back to 1960. Still, its sugar consumption is less than 14% of what\u2019s eaten by its larger southern neighbor, US Department of Agriculture data show. The influx of spending in Canada\u2019s confectionery sector doesn\u2019t mean suppliers are throwing in the towel in the US just yet. In addition to its $60 million Canadian expansion, Blommer will also spend a combined $40 million to upgrade manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania and California, while Hershey has been building its first new US chocolate manufacturing facility in more than 30 years. Mondelez last May opened a research and development center in New Jersey that cost almost $50 million. Spokespeople for Blommer, Mondelez and Hershey didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.", "summary": "Sweets production\u00a0has expanded in Canada as companies\u00a0look to supply\u00a0sugar-hungry North American households while avoiding\u00a0US\u00a0protectionist policies.", "url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/costly-us-sugar-tariffs-drive-candy-makers-over-the-border-to-canada", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/us-sugar-grows-more-expensive-versus-global-benchmark-sprea.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:58:59", "author": "Bloomberg News", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": -0.028}

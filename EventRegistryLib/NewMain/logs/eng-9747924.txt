Their estimate is about eight times higher than the official COVID-19 deaths in India, and 1.5 times the World Health Organisation's estimates, researchers, including those from the University of Oxford, UK, said.\n\nUsing data of over 7.65 lakh individuals, the study also estimated changes in life expectancy at birth, by gender and social group between 2019 and 2020 in India. The data was taken from the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5).\n\nThe COVID-19 death toll in India, getting it right\n\nAccording to the study, the life expectancy in women fell by 3.1 years, while it fell by 2.1 years in men, the authors said. Gender inequalities in healthcare and resource distribution within households could be possible reasons, they said. These patterns contrast with those seen in high-income countries, where excess deaths were higher among men than women during the pandemic, the authors pointed out.\n\nMinistry says there are 'critical flaws' in methodology\n\nHowever, the Health Ministry, in its statement said: \"The most important flaw is that the authors have taken a subset of households included in the NFHS survey between January and April 2021, compared mortality in these households in 2020 with 2019, and extrapolated the results to the entire country.\" The NFHS sample is representative of the country only when it is considered as a whole. The 23 per cent of households included in this analysis from part of 14 states cannot be considered representative of the country, the statement said.\n\n\"The other critical flaw is related to possible selection and reporting biases in the included sample due to the time in which these data were collected, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" it said.\n\nLife expectancy among different social groups\n\nIn another finding, the researchers, while looking at social groups, found that high caste Hindu groups experienced a life expectancy decline of 1.3 years, whereas Muslims and Scheduled Tribes experienced a 5.4-year and 4.1-year drop in their life expectancies. The pandemic therefore, exacerbated the disparities already faced by these marginalised caste and religious groups in terms of life expectancy, the authors said.\n\nLife expectancy dropped by 1.6 years during pandemic, reversing past progress: Lancet study\n\n\"Marginalised groups already had lower life expectancy, and the pandemic further increased the gap between the most privileged Indian social groups, and the most marginalised social groups in India,\" said first author Aashish Gupta, a research fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\nFurther, the researchers found that deaths in India increased across age groups, most prominently among the youngest and the oldest, whereas drops in life expectancy in high-income countries were largely driven by increased deaths in those aged 60 years and above.\n\nMore evidence of excess deaths in India during pandemic\n\nExcess deaths among the youngest could be explained by children in certain areas being more vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection, they said. The indirect effects of the pandemic and lockdowns, including deteriorating economic conditions and disruptions to public health services, also contributed to excess mortality in the youngest age groups, according to the authors.\n\nCRS is a robust system: Health Ministry\n\nContesting all of the findings, the Union Health Ministry said the paper erroneously argues for the need for such analyses claiming that vital registration systems in low and middle income countries, including India, is weak. \"This is far from being correct. The Civil Registration System (CRS) in India is highly robust and captures over 99 per cent of deaths. This reporting has constantly increased from 75 per cent in 2015 to over 99 per cent in 2020,\" the statement said.\n\nData from this system shows death registration has increased by 4.74 lakh in 2020 compared to 2019, it said. There was a similar increase of 4.86 lakh and 6.90 lakh in death registrations in 2018 and 2019 over the respective previous years, the statement said.\n\nA call for improving civil registration systems\n\n\"Notably, all excess deaths in a year in the CRS are not attributable to the pandemic. Excess number is also due to an increasing trend of death registration in CRS (it was 92 per cent in 2019) and a larger population base in the succeeding year,\" it said.\n\n\"It is strongly asserted that an excess mortality of about 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper in 2020 over the previous year is a gross and misleading overestimate,\" the statement said.\n\nIt is noteworthy that excess mortality during the pandemic means increase in deaths due to all causes, and cannot be equated with deaths that were directly caused by Covid, it said.\n\nEstimates are erroneous: Health Ministry\n\nThe erroneous nature of the estimates published by the researchers is further corroborated by data from India's Sample Registration System (SRS), the statement said.\n\nThe SRS covers a population of 84 lakh in 24 lakh households in 8,842 sample units spread across 36 states and UTs, it said. While the authors take great pains to show that results from the NFHS analyses and SRS analyses for 2018 and 2019 are comparable, they completely fail to report that the SRS data in 2020 shows very little, if any, excess mortality compared to the 2019 data (crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2020, crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2019) and no reduction in life expectancy, the statement said.\n\nData | India's excess deaths could be highest among nations with the most recorded COVID-19 fatalities\n\nThe paper reports results on age and sex, which are contrary to research and programme data on COVID-19 in India. The paper claims that excess mortality was greater in females and in younger age groups (particularly 0-19 year old children), it said. Data on about 5.3 lakh recorded deaths due to Covid-19, as well as research data from cohorts and registries consistently shows higher mortality due to Covid-19 in males than females (2:1) and in older age groups.\n\nThese inconsistent and unexplainable results in the published paper further reduce any confidence in its claims, the statement said.\n\nIn conclusion, the all-cause excess mortality in 2020 compared with the previous year in India is markedly less than the 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper.\n\n\"The paper published today is methodologically flawed and shows results that are untenable and unacceptable,\" the statement added.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Civil Registration System (CRS) in India is highly robust and captures over 99 per cent of deaths.

This extrapolated estimate is about eight times higher than the official number of COVID-19 deaths in India, and 1.5 times higher than the World Health Organization's estimates.\n\nKashyap, Professor of Demography and Computational Social Science at the University of Oxford said, \"Our findings challenge the view that 2020 was not significant in terms of the mortality impacts and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. While a mortality surge caused by the delta variant in 2021 received more attention, our study reveals significant and unequal mortality increases even earlier on in the pandemic.\"\n\nUsing high-quality survey data from 765,180 individuals, the study estimated changes in life expectancy at birth, by sex and social group between 2019 and 2020 in India -- a country where one-third of global pandemic excess deaths are thought to have occurred.\n\nThe study found large mortality impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 on younger age groups, women, and marginalized social groups. Marginalized social groups within India experienced greater life expectancy declines than the most privileged social groups.\n\nGupta, Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow at the University of Oxford said, \"Marginalized groups already had lower life expectancy, and the pandemic further increased the gap between the most privileged Indian social groups, and the most marginalized social groups in India.\"\n\nWhile high caste Hindu groups experienced a life expectancy decline of 1.3 years, the loss for Muslims was 5.4 years and 4.1 years for Scheduled Tribes. These marginalized caste and religious groups already faced large disadvantages in life expectancy -- disparities which were only exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nThe study also found larger losses among females compared to males among almost all Indian social groups and classes. Women in India experienced life expectancy declines of 3.1 years -- one year more than men who experienced life expectancy losses of 2.1 years. This pattern could be explained by gender inequalities in health care and allocation of resources within households. It also contrasts with the pattern found in high-income countries where excess mortality was higher among men than women during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile life expectancy declines in high-income countries were primarily driven by mortality increases in over 60s, mortality increased in almost all age groups in India and most prominently in the youngest and older age groups.

Co-authored by the University of Oxford's Department of Sociology and the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science's Dr. Aashish Gupta and Professor Ridhi Kashyap, the study was published today (July 19) in the journal Science Advances.\n\nOverall, mortality across India was 17% higher in 2020 compared to 2019, implying 1.19 million excess deaths in India. This extrapolated estimate is about eight times higher than the official number of COVID-19 deaths in India, and 1.5 times higher than the World Health Organization's estimates.\n\nRidhi Kashyap, Professor of Demography and Computational Social Science at the University of Oxford said, \"Our findings challenge the view that 2020 was not significant in terms of the mortality impacts and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

These are based on untenable and unacceptable estimates,\" the Health Ministry said in a press release on Saturday.\n\nWhile the authors claim to follow standard methodology for analysing the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), there are critical flaws in the methodology, added the release.\n\nThe most important flaw is that the authors have taken a subset of households included in the NFHS survey between January and April 2021, compared mortality in these households in 2020 with 2019, and extrapolated the results to the entire country, the release added.\n\nThe NFHS sample is representative of the country only when it is considered as a whole. The 23 per cent of households included in this analysis from part of 14 states cannot be considered representative of the country.\n\nThe other critical flaw is related to possible selection and reporting biases in the included sample due to the time in which these data were collected, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe paper erroneously argues for the need for such analyses, claiming that the vital registration system in low and middle-income countries, including India, is weak. This is far from being correct.\n\nThe Civil Registration System (CRS) in India is highly robust and captures over 99 per cent of deaths. This reporting has constantly increased, from 75 per cent in 2015 to over 99 per cent in 2020. Data from this system shows death registration has increased by 4.74 lakh in the year 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nThere was a similar increase of 4.86 lakh and 6.90 lakh in death registration in the years 2018 and 2019 over the respective previous years. Notably, all excess deaths in a year in the CRS are not attributable to the pandemic. The excess number is also due to an increasing trend of death registration in CRS (it was 92 per cent in 2019) and a larger population base in the succeeding year.\n\nIt is strongly asserted that an excess mortality of about 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper in 2020 over the previous year is a gross and misleading overestimate. It is noteworthy that excess mortality during the pandemic means an increase in deaths due to all causes and cannot be equated with deaths that were directly caused by COVID-19.\n\nThe erroneous nature of the estimates published by the researchers is further corroborated by data from India's Sample Registration System (SRS). SRS covers around 84 lakhs population in 24 lakh households in 8842 sample units spread across 36 States or UTs in the country.\n\nWhile the authors take great pains to show that results from NFHS analyses and Sample Registration Survey analyses for 2018 and 2019 are comparable, they completely fail to report that SRS data in 2020 shows very little, if any, excess mortality compared with 2019 data (Crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2020, Crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2019) and no reduction in life expectancy, the release said.\n\nThe paper reports results on age and sex, that are contrary to research and programme data on COVID-19 in India. The paper claims that excess mortality was greater in females and in younger age groups (particularly 0-19-year-old children).\n\nData on about 5.3 lakh recorded deaths due to COVID-19, as well as research data from cohorts and registries, consistently shows higher mortality due to COVID-19 in males than females (2:1) and in older age groups (several fold higher in &gt; 60-year-olds than in 0-15-year-old children).

Gender inequalities in healthcare and resource distribution within households could be possible reasons, they said.\n\nThe patterns contrast with those seen in high-income countries, where excess deaths were higher among men than women during the pandemic, the authors said in the study published in the journal Science Advances.\n\nLooking at social groups, the researchers found that high caste Hindu groups experienced a life expectancy decline of 1.3 years, whereas Muslims and Scheduled Tribes experienced a 5.4-year and 4.1-year drop in their life expectancies.\n\nThe pandemic exacerbated the disparities already faced by these marginalised caste and religious groups in terms of life expectancy, the authors said.\n\n\"Marginalised groups already had lower life expectancy, and the pandemic further increased the gap between the most privileged Indian social groups, and the most marginalised social groups in India,\" said first author Aashish Gupta, a research fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\nFurther, the researchers found that deaths in India increased across age groups, most prominently among the youngest and the oldest, whereas drops in life expectancy in high-income countries were largely driven by increased deaths in those aged 60 years and above.\n\nExcess deaths among the youngest could be explained by children in certain areas being more vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection, they said.\n\nThe indirect effects of the pandemic and lockdowns, including deteriorating economic conditions and disruptions to public health services, also contributed to excess mortality in the youngest age groups, according to the authors.\n\n\"Using unique demographic and health survey data, our study highlights the importance of focussing on inequality when measuring mortality and shows that pandemics can worsen, rather than equalise, existing disparities,\" said author Ridhi Kashyap, a professor of demography and computational social science, University of Oxford.\n\n\"This was particularly noticeable on the role that COVID-19 had in further exacerbating the health impacts of pre-pandemic gender disparities,\" Kashyap said.",

The Ministry claims that the study, published in the Science Advances,was based on untenable and unacceptable estimates.\n\n\"It is strongly asserted that an excess mortality of about 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper in 2020 over the previous year is a gross and misleading overestimate. It is noteworthy that excess mortality during the pandemic means an increase in deaths due to all causes, and cannot be equated with deaths that were directly caused by COVID-19,'' the Ministry said.\n\nAccording to the Ministry, the paper reports results on age and sex, which are contrary to research and program data on COVID-19 in India. The paper claims that excess mortality was greater in females and in younger age groups (particularly 0-19 year old children). Data on about 5.3 lakh recorded deaths due to COVID-19 virus, as well as research data from cohorts and registries consistently shows higher mortality due to the virus in males than females (2:1) and in older age groups (several fold higher in > 60 years olds than in 0-15 year old children). These inconsistent and unexplainable results in the published paper further reduce any confidence in its claims.\n\nIn a statement issued on Saturday, the Ministry said that \"the excess mortality reported in the Science Advances paper in 2020 over the previous year is a gross and misleading overestimate. The study is erroneous and methodology followed by the authors has critical flaws; the claims are inconsistent and unexplainable. The all-cause excess mortality in 2020 compared with the previous year in India is markedly less than the 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper.''\n\nIt added that discrepancies between the study's findings and established COVID-19 mortality patterns further undermine its credibility. \"Study fails to acknowledge India's robust Civil Registration System (CRS), which recorded a substantial increase in death registrations (over 99%) in 2020, not solely attributable to the pandemic,\" the Ministry maintained.\n\nWhile the authors claim to follow standard methodology of analysing the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), there are critical flaws in methodology.\n\nIt noted that the most important flaw is that the authors have taken a subset of households included in the NFHS-5 survey between January and April 2021, compared mortality in these households in 2020 with 2019, and extrapolated the results to the entire country.\n\n\"The NFHS sample is representative of the country only when it is considered as a whole. The 23% of households included in this analysis from part of 14 States cannot be considered representative of the country. The other critical flaw is related to possible selection and reporting biases in the included sample due to the time in which these data were collected, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic,'' the Ministry said, adding that the paper is methodologically flawed and shows results that are untenable and unacceptable.\n\nIt elaborates that the paper erroneously argues for the need for such analyses claiming that the vital registration system in low and middle income countries including India is weak. This is far from being correct. The CRS in India is highly robust and captures over 99% of deaths. This reporting has constantly increased from 75% in 2015 to over 99% in 2020. Data from this system shows death registration has increased by 4.74 lakh in the year 2020 compared to 2019. There was a similar increase of 4.86 lakh and 6.90 lakh in death registration in the year 2018 and 2019 over the respective previous years. Notably, all excess deaths in a year in the CRS are not attributable to the pandemic. Excess number is also due to an increasing trend of death registration in CRS (it was 92% in 2019) and a larger population base in the succeeding year.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Excess mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 pandemic in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Advances", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Science Advances"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Research Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohort study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/jeigf5/article68425945.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_TH_-_9127_14-10-2020_2_1_UABOSFB8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747924", "eventUri": "eng-9747924", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

contributed to excess mortality in the youngest age groups, according to the authors.\n\n\"Using unique demographic and health survey data, our study highlights the importance of focussing on inequality when measuring mortality and shows that pandemics can worsen, rather than equalise, existing disparities,\" said author Ridhi Kashyap, a professor of demography and computational social science, University of Oxford.\n\n\"This was particularly noticeable on the role that Covid-19 had in further exacerbating the health impacts of pre-pandemic gender disparities,\" Kashyap said.",

These are based on untenable and unacceptable estimates.\n\nWhile the authors claim to follow standard methodology of analyzing National Family Health Survey-5 NFHS-5), there are critical flaws in methodology. The most important flaw is that the authors have taken a subset of households included in the NFHS survey between January and April 2021, compared mortality in these households in 2020 with 2019, and extrapolated the results to the entire country. The NFHS sample is representative of the country only when it is considered as a whole. The 23% of households included in this analysis from part of 14 states cannot be considered representative of the country. The other critical flaw is related to possible selection and reporting biases in the included sample due to the time in which these data were collected, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe paper erroneously argues for the need for such analyses claiming that vital registration system in low and middle income countries including India is weak. This is far from being correct. The Civil Registration System (CRS) in India is highly robust and captures over 99% of deaths. This reporting has constantly increased from 75% in 2015 to over 99% in 2020. Data from this system shows death registration has increased by 4.74 lakh in the year 2020 compared to 2019. There was a similar increase of 4.86 lakh and 6.90 lakh in death registration in the year 2018 and 2019 over the respective previous years. Notably, all excess deaths in a year in the CRS are not attributable to the pandemic. Excess number is also due to an increasing trend of death registration in CRS (it was 92% in 2019) and a larger population base in the succeeding year.\n\nIt is strongly asserted that an excess mortality of about 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper in 2020 over the previous year is a gross and misleading overestimate. It is noteworthy that excess mortality during the pandemic means increase in deaths due to all causes, and cannot be equated with deaths that were directly caused by Covid-19.\n\nThe erroneous nature of the estimates published by the researchers is further corroborated by data from India's Sample registration System (SRS). SRS covers around 84 lakhs population in 24 lakh households in 8842 sample units spread across 36 States/UTs in the country. While the authors take great pains to show that results from NFHS analyses and Sample Registration Survey analyses for 2018 and 2019 are comparable, they completely fail to report that SRS data in 2020 shows very little, if any, excess mortality compared with 2019 data (Crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2020, Crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2019) and no reduction in life expectancy.\n\nThe paper reports results on age and sex, that are contrary to research and program data on Covid-19 in India. The paper claims that excess mortality was greater in females and in younger age groups (particularly 0-19 year old children). Data on about 5.3 lakh recorded deaths due to Covid-19, as well as research data from cohorts and registries consistently shows higher mortality due to Covid-19 in males than females (2:1) and in older age groups (several fold higher in > 60 years olds than in 0-15 year old children).

When mortality rises among a group, life expectancy goes down.\n\nThe paper published on Friday in the science journal Science Advances compared life expectancy at birth among Indians in 2019 to that in 2020, using data from the National Family Health Survey, which it says is representative of about one-fourth of India's population.\n\nOverall, life expectancy at birth among Indians was 2.6 years lower and mortality was 17% higher in 2020 than the previous year, the research found.\n\nThis implies 11.9 lakh excess deaths in 2020, according to the research paper. Excess deaths is a metric used to analyse Covid-19 mortality by calculating the divergence between deaths reported due to all causes in a pandemic year and in normal years.\n\nThis estimate for excess deaths in India in 2020 is nearly eight times the official number of Covid-19 fatalities, and 1.5 times the excess deaths estimated by the World Health Organization during the year, the researchers said in their paper.\n\nUsing this metric, the study found that in India, mortality increased in almost all age groups between 2019 and 2020, but most prominently among the youngest and older age groups, mirroring the trend seen across the world.\n\nHowever, contrary to the global trend, the life expectancy of women in India declined by one year more than that of men in 2020.\n\nAashish Gupta, a post-doctoral research fellow at Oxford University and one of co-authors of the research paper told Scroll that this is the first study to have examined mortality impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic in India by sex, social group, and age.\n\nGupta also said that using data from the National Family Health Survey's fifth round, the study revealed patterns in Covid-19 mortality in India that could not be observed in other data sources like the Civil Registration System, a nationwide system of recording all births and deaths.\n\nThe Civil Registration System has been found to be lacking in coverage among women and other marginalised groups even during normal times, Gupta said. \"Moreover, the system was disrupted between March and May 2020, during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, due to a severe lockdown in India,\" he added.\n\nThe study shows that excess mortality and a sharper decline in life expectancy prevailed across population groups that are vulnerable and marginalised in terms of sex, religion, caste and age.\n\nFor example, the study found an overall decline of 2.6 years in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020. But the loss among women was 3.1 years, that is one year more than the 2.1 years observed among men. This is in contrast to the global trend as in most countries, losses to life expectancy were greater for men than women, the study noted.\n\nIn normal years, women outlive men in India. But when the pandemic hit, the loss of life expectancy was larger among women due to gender-biased social conditions, Gupta told Scroll.\n\n\"We need to keep in mind that during the pandemic when everything is a pinch on your pocket, what gets prioritised in Indian households,\" Gupta said. \"When you are short of money and access to healthcare is limited, you would prioritise a male aged 40 to 60 years old who is probably the earning member of the family.\"\n\nAnother factor Gupta pointed out was the underreporting of female deaths in official records like the Civil Registration System, which he said, was a shortcoming in the system even before the pandemic.\n\n\"If you look at serosurveys [which measure levels of antibodies against a virus], you will find the level of infection is similar among men and women, but the number of deaths is higher among men,\" he said. \"The National Family Health Survey shows that it is not that more men died, but that they are getting reported more because Covid death registration is a function of whether you are getting tested and counted as a death in a hospital.\"\n\nLike in the case of women, the study also found greater decline in life expectancy among disadvantaged caste and religious groups, as compared to privileged social groups in India.\n\nIncreased Covid-19 deaths among vulnerable groups showed that the inequality in access to healthcare widened during the pandemic.\n\nThis could explain why the decline in life expectancy among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was sharper than in upper caste Hindus, Gupta said. \"The fact remains that excess mortality was higher in these marginalised groups and that got underreported, so that itself shows that what is happening to these groups does not make it to the national conversation,\" he added.\n\nFor Muslims specifically, Gupta pointed out that marginalisation had become more prominent in recent years. \"In the beginning of 2020, for example, there were riots in Delhi, so the narrative of marginalisation intensified, and there were reports of Muslim-dominated areas being completely cut off from health care.\"\n\nGupta said the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi was an example of marginalisation of Muslims during the pandemic.\n\nThe religious congregation took place in March 2020 in Delhi's Nizamuddin area, days before a countrywide lockdown was imposed. After the Centre declared the congregation as a hotspot for Covid-19 infection, rumours and fake news gave the spread of the coronavirus a communal hue.\n\nIn terms of age, increased mortality was most prominent among the youngest and older age groups, the study found. Gupta said that this was consistent with underlying patterns as these age groups have higher mortality rates even in normal situations. But due to the stress on the healthcare system caused by the pandemic, immunisation programmes for children and old-age care might have been disrupted resulting in mortality rates going even higher.\n\nGupta also told Scroll that the study's finding on the undercounting of deaths due to Covid-19 in 2020 punches holes in the \"triumphalist narrative\" within the government about pandemic mortality being contained before the second wave of the pandemic hit in 2021.\n\nHe said that the mortality due to Covid-19 in the second wave got more noticed because it was an acute crisis that took place over a very short period. \"But existing data has not been able to capture the extent of mortality in 2020,\" he said.\n\nAs an example, Gupta pointed out that the World Health Organization data on Covid-19 mortality in India showed fewer deaths in April 2020 as compared to the same month in the previous year. This was because, Gupta said, the WHO took the Civil Registration System at face value, but the system itself was impacted because of a lockdown in the country.\n\nThis sort of undercounting of deaths allowed the government to say that the worst of the pandemic was over even as serosurveys that provide an estimate of levels of antibodies against a virus suggested otherwise, Gupta said.\n\n\"In March 2021, there was this triumphalist narrative that we have overcome Covid and nothing happened,\" Gupta said. \"Our study shows that if you had datasets like the National Family Health Survey that monitor mortality more accurately, we would not have such a triumphalist interpretation of the pandemic. We would have been better prepared before the delta [second] wave arrived.\"", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhik_deb@scroll.in", "name": "Abhik Deb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Excess mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Family_Health_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Family Health Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 pandemic in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Advances", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science Advances"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demographics of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdown_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdown in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Codependency", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Codependency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Disability", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Disability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/171973-pwwdegjjvg-1648114232.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747924", "eventUri": "eng-9747924", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "dateEnd": "2020-05-", "textStart": 2853, "textEnd": 2871}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 5827, "textEnd": 5837}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 7154, "textEnd": 7164}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Their peer-reviewed paper has been published in Science Advances, a US journal.\n\nThey found that life expectancy at birth in India was 2.6 years lower and mortality was 17% higher in 2020 compared to 2019. This implied 1.19 million excess deaths in 2020. Excess deaths are a simple measure of how many more people are dying than expected, compared with previous years.\n\nThe researchers of the new study say life expectancy declines in India were larger and affected a younger age profile compared to high-income countries.\n\nThey found that mortality rose among all age groups, but compared to high-income countries, the increase was particularly pronounced in younger age groups, leading to larger declines in life expectancy.\n\nThe researchers also found something which was more worrying.\n\nFor one, females experienced a life expectancy decline of one year greater than males. This contrasts with patterns in most other countries and may be due to gender inequality, say the researchers from University of Oxford, University of California, Berkeley and Paris School of Economics, among others.\n\nAlso, marginalised social groups - Muslims, Dalits, and tribespeople - in India saw larger declines in life expectancy compared to privileged upper caste people, exacerbating existing disparities.\n\nThe researchers agree that before Covid, these groups already had significant disadvantages in life expectancy. The pandemic worsened these disparities, with declines comparable to or greater than those seen among Native Americans, Blacks, and Hispanics in the US in 2020, the study says.\n\n\"These findings uncover large and unequal mortality impacts during the pandemic in the world's most populous country,\" Sangita Vyas, of CUNY Hunter College and one of the researchers, told me.\n\nMore than 4.7 million people in India - nearly 10 times higher than official records suggest - are thought to have died because of Covid, according to a 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) report. India's government rejected the figure, saying the methodology was flawed.\n\nTo be sure, the latest study looked at deaths from all causes, not just deaths from Covid. \"For that reason we can't conclude that women in India were more likely to die of Covid than men,\" says Ms Vyas. \"What we can conclude is that the increase in mortality from all causes was greater for women than men\".\n\nThe researchers believe these patterns partly stem from gender inequality.\n\nPrevious research shows Indian households spend less on healthcare for females compared to males, a disparity which likely worsened during the pandemic. Fewer females appear in India's official Covid-19 case data, despite surveys showing similar infection rates among males and females.\n\nFurthermore, severe disruptions to maternal healthcare and livelihoods due to lockdowns likely contributed to these trends.\n\nHow did the researchers come to these findings? They surveyed data of more than 765,000 people - a sample size that accurately reflects the diversity and distribution of a quarter of India's population - to identify patterns missed by incomplete data and disease surveillance.\n\nIndia's National Family Health Survey 5 collected high quality data on recent household deaths and socio-economic characteristics. This allowed researchers to analyse age, sex, and group-specific mortality patterns. They compared mortality in 2019 and 2020 using data from the same households interviewed in 2021.\n\nThe researchers believe more research is necessary to explore why females in India experienced higher excess deaths than males, why excess mortality affected younger age groups more in India compared to other countries, and why Muslims saw significant declines in life expectancy compared to other social groups.\n\n\"These patterns likely resulted from disparities in healthcare access and underlying health, differing impacts of lockdowns on public health and livelihoods, and increased discrimination against marginalised groups,\" says Ms Vyas.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This extrapolated estimate is about eight times higher than the official number of COVID-19 deaths in India, and 1.5 times higher than the World Health Organization's estimates.\n\nRidhi Kashyap, Professor of Demography and Computational Social Science at the University of Oxford said, 'Our findings challenge the view that 2020 was not significant in terms of the mortality impacts and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. While a mortality surge caused by the Delta variant in 2021 received more attention, our study reveals significant and unequal mortality increases even earlier on in the pandemic.'\n\nUsing high-quality survey data from 765,180 individuals, the study estimated changes in life expectancy at birth, by sex and social group between 2019 and 2020 in India - a country where one-third of global pandemic excess deaths are thought to have occurred.\n\nThe study found large mortality impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 on younger age groups, women, and marginalised social groups. Marginalised social groups within India experienced greater life expectancy declines than the most privileged social groups.\n\nDr Aashish Gupta, Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow at the University of Oxford said, 'Marginalised groups already had lower life expectancy, and the pandemic further increased the gap between the most privileged Indian social groups, and the most marginalised social groups in India.'\n\nWhile high caste Hindu groups experienced a life expectancy decline of 1.3 years, the loss for Muslims was 5.4 years and 4.1 years for Scheduled Tribes. These marginalised caste and religious groups already faced large disadvantages in life expectancy - disparities which were only exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nThe study also found larger losses among females compared to males among almost all Indian social groups and classes. Women in India experienced life expectancy declines of 3.1 years - one year more than men who experienced life expectancy losses of 2.1 years. This pattern could be explained by gender inequalities in healthcare and allocation of resources within households. It also contrasts with the pattern found in high-income countries where excess mortality was higher among men than women during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile life expectancy declines in high-income countries were primarily driven by mortality increases in over 60s, mortality increased in almost all age groups in India and most prominently in the youngest and older age groups. Excess morality in the youngest ages could be explained by children in certain areas being more susceptible to COVID-19 and by indirect effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, including deteriorating economic conditions and disruptions to public health services.\n\nProfessor Ridhi Kashyap said, 'Using unique demographic and health survey data, our study highlights the importance of focussing on inequality when measuring mortality and shows that pandemics can worsen, rather than equalise, existing disparities. This was particularly noticeable on the role that COVID-19 had in further exacerbating the health impacts of pre-pandemic gender disparities.'\n\nThis study shows the potential for accurately estimating mortality - even for short periods - using retrospective mortality information collected in a relatively poor context. It also emphasises the need for policies that address the underlying social determinants of health to mitigate the impact of future health crises.\n\nFor more information and interviews, please contact the communications teams at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science (LCDS.Media@demography.ox.ac.uk) and at the Department of Sociology (comms@sociology.ox.ac.uk).\n\nMore information, including a copy of the paper, can be found online at the Science Advances press package at https://www.eurekalert.org/press/vancepak/\n\nA video interview with Dr Aashish Gupta can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqLrIJNxH74\n\nAbout University of Oxford's Department of Sociology\n\nOxford Sociology is at the forefront of ground-breaking empirical research which spans the full spectrum of the social world.

The paper published today is methodologically flawed and shows results that are untenable and unacceptable,\" the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) said.\n\nDeaths in India \"increased by 4.74 lakh in the year 2020 compared to 2019,\" said the ministry, sharing data based on the \"highly robust\" Civil Registration System (CRS) -- a national portal for registering birth and death events.\n\n\"There was a similar increase of 4.86 lakh and 6.90 lakh in death registration in the year 2018 and 2019 over the respective previous years,\" it added.\n\nIt noted that all excess deaths are not attributable to the pandemic and may include mortality due to all causes.\n\nThe increase is also due to \"an increasing trend of death registration in CRS (it was 92 per cent in 2019) and a larger population base in the succeeding year,\" the MoHFW said, adding that India recorded \"about 5.3 lakh deaths due to Covid-19.\"\n\nFurther, the ministry slammed the authors' claim to follow the standard methodology of analysing the National Family Health Survey-5 NFHS-5).\n\n\"There are critical flaws in methodology,\" as the study is based only on 23 per cent of households from part of 14 states from the NFHS survey between January and April 2021.\n\n\"It cannot be considered representative of the country\", it said that the \"nature of the estimates is erroneous.\"\n\nCiting the data from India's Sample Registration System (SRS) which covers around 84 lakh population in 24 lakh households in 8,842 sample units spread across 36 States/UTs in the country, the ministry noted that India had \"very little, if any, excess mortality in 2020 compared with 2019 data (crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2020, crude death rate 6.0/1000 in 2019) and no reduction in life expectancy.\"\n\nMoreover, the MoHFW said that contrary to the study claims of higher female mortality, \"research data from cohorts and registries consistently shows higher mortality due to Covid-19 in males than females (2:1) and in older age groups (several-fold higher in > 60 years olds than in 0-15-year-old children).\"", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The ministry stated that India's Civil Registration System (CRS) is highly robust, capturing over 99% of deaths, with reporting consistently increasing from 75% in 2015 to over 99% in 2020.\n\nThe ministry further noted that the excess deaths reported in the CRS are not solely attributable to the pandemic, as the increase in death registration is also due to an increasing trend in CRS coverage and a larger population base in the succeeding year.\n\n\"It is strongly asserted that an excess mortality of about 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the 'Science Advances' paper in 2020 over the previous year is a gross and misleading overestimate,\" the statement said.\n\nThe ministry also pointed out that the paper's results on age and sex are contrary to research and program data on Covid-19 in India.\n\nThe paper claimed that excess mortality was greater in females and younger age groups, particularly children aged 0-19 years. However, data on recorded Covid-19 deaths and research from cohorts and registries consistently show higher mortality in males than females (2:1) and in older age groups.\n\nThe ministry stated that the all-cause excess mortality in India in 2020 compared to the previous year is markedly less than the 11.9 lakh deaths reported in the Science Advances paper.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The ministry has termed the study's estimates as \"untenable and unacceptable.\"\n\nThe study was published in the Science Advances journal and revealed a major decline in life expectancy in India, with a loss of 2.6 years between 2019 and 2020. The research showed that socially disadvantaged groups, including Muslims and Scheduled Tribes, were disproportionately affected, with women experiencing a more substantial decline in life expectancy (3.1 years) compared to males (2.1 years).\n\nThe Health Ministry has pointed out several methodological flaws in the study, arguing that the authors' sampling methodology was flawed. The study used a limited subset of households (23 per cent) from 14 states, which is not representative of the entire country. The ministry further added that the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) sample is only reliable when considered in its entirety.\n\nThat apart, the ministry highlighted potential biases in the study, including selection and reporting biases, given that the data was collected during the pandemic's peak.

This extrapolated estimate is about eight times higher than the official number of COVID-19 deaths in India, and 1.5 times higher than the World Health Organization's estimates.\n\nRidhi Kashyap, Professor of Demography and Computational Social Science at the University of Oxford said, 'Our findings challenge the view that 2020 was not significant in terms of the mortality impacts and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. While a mortality surge caused by the Delta variant in 2021 received more attention, our study reveals significant and unequal mortality increases even earlier on in the pandemic.'\n\nUsing high-quality survey data from 765,180 individuals, the study estimated changes in life expectancy at birth, by sex and social group between 2019 and 2020 in India - a country where one-third of global pandemic excess deaths are thought to have occurred.\n\nThe study found large mortality impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 on younger age groups, women, and marginalised social groups. Marginalised social groups within India experienced greater life expectancy declines than the most privileged social groups.\n\nDr Aashish Gupta, Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow at the University of Oxford said, 'Marginalised groups already had lower life expectancy, and the pandemic further increased the gap between the most privileged Indian social groups, and the most marginalised social groups in India.'\n\nWhile high caste Hindu groups experienced a life expectancy decline of 1.3 years, the loss for Muslims was 5.4 years and 4.1 years for Scheduled Tribes. These marginalised caste and religious groups already faced large disadvantages in life expectancy - disparities which were only exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nThe study also found larger losses among females compared to males among almost all Indian social groups and classes. Women in India experienced life expectancy declines of 3.1 years - one year more than men who experienced life expectancy losses of 2.1 years. This pattern could be explained by gender inequalities in healthcare and allocation of resources within households. It also contrasts with the pattern found in high-income countries where excess mortality was higher among men than women during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile life expectancy declines in high-income countries were primarily driven by mortality increases in over 60s, mortality increased in almost all age groups in India and most prominently in the youngest and older age groups. Excess morality in the youngest ages could be explained by children in certain areas being more susceptible to COVID-19 and by indirect effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, including deteriorating economic conditions and disruptions to public health services.\n\nProfessor Ridhi Kashyap said, 'Using unique demographic and health survey data, our study highlights the importance of focussing on inequality when measuring mortality and shows that pandemics can worsen, rather than equalise, existing disparities. This was particularly noticeable on the role that COVID-19 had in further exacerbating the health impacts of pre-pandemic gender disparities.'\n\nThis study shows the potential for accurately estimating mortality - even for short periods - using retrospective mortality information collected in a relatively poor context. It also emphasises the need for policies that address the underlying social determinants of health to mitigate the impact of future health crises.\n\nFor more information and interviews, please contact the communications teams at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science (LCDS.Media@demography.ox.ac.uk) and at the Department of Sociology (comms@sociology.ox.ac.uk).\n\nMore information, including a copy of the paper, can be found online at the Science Advances press package at\n\nA video interview with Dr Aashish Gupta can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqLrIJNxH74\n\nAbout University of Oxford's Department of Sociology\n\nOxford Sociology is at the forefront of ground-breaking empirical research which spans the full spectrum of the social world.

This number is substantially higher, about eight times more, than the official COVID-19 death count reported in India.\n\nUsing data collected from over 7.65 lakh individuals, researchers, including those from the University of Oxford, UK, evaluated changes in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020.

The study pointed out that gender inequalities and disparities within households could be likely reasons for this trend.\n\nThe study also highlighted that marginalized caste and religious groups, such as Muslims and Scheduled Tribes, faced the most significant drops in life expectancy. The pandemic aggravated pre-existing disparities, with excess deaths notably affecting both the youngest and the oldest age groups.

The authors compared mortality rates in these households for 2020 with 2019 and extrapolated the results to the entire country. The Ministry asserted, \"The NFHS sample is representative of the country only when considered as a whole. The 23% of households included in this analysis from part of 14 states cannot be considered representative of the country.\"\n\nThe Ministry also pointed out potential selection and reporting biases, stating that the data was collected during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could skew the results.\n\nMoreover, the Ministry rejected the study's claim that India's vital registration system is weak. \"The Civil Registration System (CRS) in India is highly robust and captures over 99% of deaths,\" the Ministry stated, noting that death registration has steadily increased from 75% in 2015 to over 99% in 2020. The Ministry argued that while the CRS showed an increase of 4.74 lakh deaths in 2020 compared to 2019, similar increases were recorded in previous years, indicating a trend rather than an anomaly solely attributable to the pandemic.\n\nThe Ministry strongly contested the study's estimate of 11.9 lakh excess deaths in 2020, labeling it a \"gross and misleading overestimate.\" It clarified that excess mortality during the pandemic reflects deaths from all causes, not just those directly caused by COVID-19.\n\nFurther discrediting the study, the Ministry referenced data from India's Sample Registration System (SRS), which covers a substantial population across the country. The SRS data for 2020 showed no significant increase in mortality compared to 2019, with crude death rates remaining consistent at 6.0 per 1000 for both years.\n\nAdditionally, the Ministry rejected the paper's claims that excess mortality was higher among females and younger age groups, particularly children aged 0-19 years. It cited data showing higher COVID-19 mortality rates among males and older age groups, highlighting inconsistencies in the study's findings.\n\nThe Ministry concluded that the methodological flaws and unexplainable results in the published paper undermine its credibility and accuracy.\n\nREAD MORE | Fact Check: Reports claiming detection of China pneumonia cases at AIIMS Delhi misleading | Details", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Family_Health_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Family Health Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 pandemic in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Family_Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Family Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Research Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excess mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institute_of_Medical_Sciences,_New_Delhi", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/covid-deaths-1721469075.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747924", "eventUri": "eng-9747924", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 55, "textEnd": 62}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

In comparison, higher caste Hindus, and OBCs (Other Backward Classes) lost 1.3 years.\n\nThe loss of life expectancy was 3.1 years for females and 2.1 years for males. Combining both, the overall loss in life expectancy in India was 2.6 years, according to the study that used data from the National Family Health Survey-5 conducted during 2019-21.\n\nSuch a large female disadvantage in the pandemic's impact, as observed in India, has not been documented in any other country. Moreover, the mortality was 17 per cent higher in 2020.\n\n\"What makes our study novel is that we are able to look at differences in mortality by age, sex, and social group, and show that there were very unequal impacts of the pandemic in India,\" Sangita Vyas, an economist at the City University, New York and one of the corresponding authors of the study told DH.\n\n\"Life expectancy declines in India were larger and had a younger age profile than in high-income countries. In contrast to global patterns, females in India experienced a life expectancy decline that was one year larger than losses for males. Also, marginalised social groups experienced greater declines than the most privileged social group,\" she said.\n\nSuch loss of life expectancy is similar or greater than declines experienced by the Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans in the USA, says the study published in Science Advances on Friday.\n\nReacting to the study, NITI Ayog Member (Health) Vinod Paul told DH, \"There are serious methodological flaws in the study because of which the researchers arrive at wrong conclusions.\"\n\nQuoting India's civil registration system (CRS) that registered over 99 per cent of all deaths, Paul said, \"Compared to 2019, there were 4.74 lakh extra or excess deaths in 2020. The estimate of 11.9 lakh excess deaths concluded in the study is untenable and unacceptable.\"", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kalyan_ray@deccanherald.com", "name": "Kalyan Ray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adivasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caste system in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NITI_Aayog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NITI Aayog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_high-income_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Bank high-income economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-06%2Ff5275ca9-f0aa-4ef2-955b-90f44d0ca22f%2Fcovid_test_istock_1055454_1638102010_1_1056382_1638324823.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1280%2C672&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747924", "eventUri": "eng-9747924", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

A woman walks past a coronavirus-themed graffiti on a street in Mumbai. Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters\n\nIn the aftermath of COVID-19, life expectancy saw a decline, with socially-disadvantaged groups experiencing the most significant losses.\n\nIndia lost 2.6 years in life expectancy between 2019 and 2020, greater than high-income countries, according to a research paper titled 'Large and unequal life expectancy declines during the COVID-19 pandemic in India in 2020' published in Science Advances on July 19.\n\nThe study found that the decline was more pronounced among females (3.1 years) compared to males (2.1 years).\n\nThe study uses data from the National Family Health Survey 2019-21 (NFHS-5) and analyses households from 14 states and Union Territories (UTs), representing one-fourth of India's population.\n\nThe NFHS survey was conduced in two phases and the study uses phase 2 data (households interviewed in 2021 specifically), explains Aashish Gupta, one of the co-authors.\n\n\"The NFHS asks a question on deaths of household members since 2017, which allows to estimate 2019 and 2020 mortality for the same set of households.\"\n\nThe decline in life expectancy was higher among young individuals and those aged 50 to 60, highlights the paper.\n\nIt said, 'Even though absolute increases in mortality were highest in the oldest ages, mortality increases in the younger ages contributed substantially to life expectancy losses because life expectancy is more sensitive to early-life mortality.'\n\nThe increase in mortality in the age group 0 to 19 and 60 to 79 among females contributed most to the fall in life expectancy. For males, it was the 40 to 59 age group.\n\nLike the unequal impact on gender, some social groups experienced higher losses than others.\n\nMuslims saw the largest decline from 68.8 years in 2019 to 63.4 years in 2020, a loss of 5.4 years.\n\nScheduled tribes and scheduled castes followed with reductions of 4.1 years and 2.7 years, respectively.\n\n\"Since we cannot distinguish between deaths from different causes, it is not clear whether differences across social groups are coming from direct effects of Covid (and potentially lower access to health care), indirect effects arising from the disruptions associated with lockdown, changes in marginalisation and discrimination, or other factors,\" said Sanigta Vyas, one of the co-authors.\n\nFor other backward classes (OBCs) and 'high caste Hindus', the decline was 1.3 years each.\n\nAmong Muslims, the loss was higher for females at 6.6 years than 4.6 years for males. Similarly, among SCs, females lost 4.6 years compared to 1.1 years for males.\n\nWithin STs, however, it was higher for males (5.4 years) than females (2.7 years).\n\nAmong other backward classes and 'high caste Hindus', the loss was higher for females of 1.9 years each.\n\nIt was 0.7 years and 0.9 years for males in other backward classes and 'high caste Hindus', respectively.\n\nFeature Presentation: Ashish Narsale/Rediff.com", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [{"uri": "anoushka_sawhney@rediff.com", "name": "Anoushka Sawhney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 pandemic in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_high-income_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Bank high-income economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Family_Health_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Family Health Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demographics of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_Castes_and_Scheduled_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rediff.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rediff.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Andropause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Andropause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Female_to_Male", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Female to Male", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Older_Citizens", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Older Citizens", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Research", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/news/2024/jul/20covid1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747924", "eventUri": "eng-9747924", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 685, "textEnd": 692}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Yet lockdowns disrupted this system, which already underreported deaths in women and children even before the pandemic. It doesn't collect certain information like caste or ethnicity either, says Sangita Vyas at Hunter College in New York.\n\nSo Vyas and her colleagues gathered information on deaths in India from the National Family Health Survey. This country-wide survey asks participants whether anyone in their household died in the past four years and if so, to provide data like the person's date of death, age and gender (it only includes options for men and women, not trans or non-binary identities).\n\nThe researchers analysed data from more than 765,000 participants who completed the survey in 2021. They found that deaths in 2020 were about 17 per cent higher than in 2019. If similar increases occurred across the country, that indicates almost 1.2 million excess deaths in 2020 - eight times the official number of covid-19 deaths in India in 2020 and 1.5 times the World Health Organization's estimates, according to the study.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, overall life expectancy at birth declined by more than 2.5 years in the sample, compared with a 1.5-year decline in the US during the same period. Life expectancy changes differed by gender, age and social group, too.\n\nFor instance, it fell about three years in women compared with just over two years in men. This contrasts with global trends, which show men had greater increases in mortality than women during the covid-19 pandemic. \"These unique patterns in India can likely be explained, at least in part, by gender inequality,\" says Vyas.\n\nPrior research shows Indian households spend less on healthcare for women relative to men, so the pandemic may have amplified these pre-existing disparities, says Ridhi Kashyap at the University of Oxford, who was a co-author on the study. Strict lockdowns also hindered access to maternal healthcare, potentially increasing maternal mortality rates, she says.\n\nUnlike in other countries, life expectancy declines observed in this study were largely driven by deaths in younger demographics. Increases in mortality among women and girls under 20 years old contributed approximately one year to the decline in life expectancy in 2020 - roughly the same amount as deaths in women between ages 60 and 79.\n\n\"We think that those increases in mortality are coming from indirect effects of the lockdown in India,\" says Vyas. The effects could include disrupted access to childhood vaccines and treatments for tuberculosis, which is a leading cause of death in India.\n\nThere were also stark differences between social groups. High-caste Hindus experienced a 1.3-year decline in life expectancy, while those who were Muslim or belonged to a lower caste saw 5.4-year and 2.7-year declines, respectively.\n\nPublic health experts have long been aware of India's health inequities, yet these findings highlight the magnitude of those disparities, says Vyas. \"Seeing how different populations are impacted differently is important for developing policy responses,\" she says.\n\nHowever, the study had limitations. Due to disruptions during lockdown, the survey respondents only came from 14 of India's 36 states and union territories, and the sample was demographically representative of only about one-fourth of India's population. Also, the study didn't look into cause of death. \"We can only speculate on why these patterns may be,\" says Kashyap. \"But we can't say conclusively what is causing them.\"", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdown_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdown in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maternal death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/19160042/SEI_213316445.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747924", "eventUri": "eng-9747924", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

By contrast, the average lifespan for people from 'scheduled castes' - communities that for centuries faced the worst discrimination under the caste system - went down by 2.7 years.\n\nIndian Muslims suffered the worst: Their life expectancy went down by 5.4 years in 2020.\n\nThese communities had lower life expectancy at birth relative to high-caste Hindus even before the pandemic, the study noted. \"The pandemic exacerbated these disparities,\" it added. \"These declines are comparable or larger in absolute magnitude to those experienced by Native Americans, Blacks, and Hispanics in the United States in 2020.\"\n\n\"Muslims have been facing marginalisation for a long time, and it has been intensified in the last few years,\" said Aashish Gupta, one of the authors of the study and a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow at the University of Oxford.\n\n\"We do not have any data to suggest that one group or community had more infection than others,\" Gupta told Al Jazeera. \"However, when Muslims did get COVID, findings show that they were really shunned, faced stereotypes and lacked access to healthcare. The marginalised communities were left to their devices.\"\n\nT Sundararaman, a public health expert who has served as executive director of the National Health Systems Resource Centre, the Indian Ministry of Health's think tank, said that this trend is \"consistent with what we know about how the disease affects mortality rates\".\n\n\"The consequences are more pronounced upon more marginalised sections ... everything adds on,\" he said.\n\nThe study found that women also suffered more than men. While the life expectancy among Indian men fell in 2020 by 2.1 years, it fell an extra year for women. This contrasts with the global trend - overall, across the world, the life expectancy of men fell more during the pandemic.\n\n\"There are several aspects, including the longstanding gender-based discrimination and inequality in resources allocation, in a largely patriarchal society, that contribute to higher female life expectancy declines,\" said Gupta. \"We knew that women were particularly vulnerable in Indian society but the difference was shocking to us.\"\n\nThe youngest and oldest Indians saw the steepest increases in mortality rates, but the researchers caution that this could be because of disruptions to public health services, including childhood immunisations, tuberculosis treatment and other indirect effects of COVID-19.\n\nWhile 481,000 Indians died from the pandemic, according to the government, the WHO estimates that the death toll actually stands at between 3.3 million and 6.5 million Indians - the highest for any country.\n\nThe Narendra Modi-led government has dismissed the WHO numbers, arguing that the model used by the United Nations body for calculations may not apply to India.\n\nBut it is not just global bodies. Independent public health experts and researchers have repeatedly accused the Indian government of undercounting its dead amid the pandemic. \"The government's efforts have been far shorter than what is required to address the inequality in access to healthcare,\" Sundararaman told Al Jazeera. \"The government needs to bring out the data in public for scrutiny. Nothing can be gained by not engaging with these studies,\" he added, referring to the findings in the latest research.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Gupta said that researchers like him believed that \"the government would understand the importance of good mortality data\". Instead, he said, \"things that were earlier available are not being made public any more\".\n\nThe new study only extrapolates the numbers for 2020 due to the absence of quality data to read corresponding figures for 2021 when the Delta variant struck. \"There are just data gaps everywhere we look,\" added Gupta. \"The estimates for 2021 are expected to be even higher than 2020.\"\n\nPrabhat Jha, director of the Centre for Global Health Research in Toronto, who was among the experts who backed the WHO's excess death calculation, said, \"From our understanding and forthcoming work, the Delta wave was way more deadly than 2020.\"\n\n\"Our estimate for the whole period [of the pandemic] was about 3.5-4 million excess deaths and nearly 3 million were from the Delta wave,\" said Jha, adding that he finds the new study's estimations for 2020 \"much higher\" than he had expected.\n\nJha cited disruptions in data collection for the NFHS survey during the pandemic as a factor that could have affected the quality of the data used for the new research.\n\nBut Gupta argued that the authors put \"a number of data checks in the paper that suggest that data quality was not compromised because of the pandemic\". The authors of the study also noted that the sample is \"representative of one-fourth of the population\".\n\nAll the experts agree on one thing: Greater transparency in data collected by the government could tell India once and for all how many people it lost to the pandemic.\n\n\"The Indian government can seal this entire debate by releasing the data that has direct evidence on the excess deaths,\" said Jha.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yashraj_sharma@aljazeera.com", "name": "Yashraj Sharma", "type":

According to the study, India experienced 1.19 million more deaths than the previous year, a figure that has been widely criticized as a gross and misleading overestimate.\n\nCritics have pointed out that the methodology used by the authors is fundamentally flawed, leading to erroneous conclusions. The claims made in the paper have been described as inconsistent and unexplainable, casting serious doubts on the reliability of the findings.\n\nExperts have emphasized that the actual all-cause excess mortality in India for 2020 is significantly lower than the 1.19 million deaths reported by the study. This discrepancy has raised questions about the study's alignment with established patterns of COVID-19 mortality, further undermining its credibility.\n\nOne of the major points of contention is the study's failure to adequately consider India's robust Civil Registration System (CRS). The CRS recorded a substantial increase in death registrations in 2020, achieving over 99% coverage. This increase is not solely attributable to the pandemic, suggesting that the excess mortality figures presented in the study may be exaggerated.\n\nThe debate over the accuracy of the Science Advances paper highlights the importance of rigorous methodology and accurate data interpretation in understanding the true impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

India's government rejected the figure, saying the methodology was flawed.\n\nTo be sure, the latest study looked at deaths from all causes, not just deaths from Covid. \"For that reason we can't conclude that women in India were more likely to die of Covid than men,\" says Ms Vyas. \"What we can conclude is that the increase in mortality from all causes was greater for women than men\".\n\nThe researchers believe these patterns partly stem from gender inequality.\n\nPrevious research shows Indian households spend less on healthcare for females compared to males, a disparity which likely worsened during the pandemic. Fewer females appear in India's official Covid-19 case data, despite surveys showing similar infection rates among males and females.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1b74/live/1e2d7e30-434f-11ef-96a8-e710c6bfc866.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747924", "eventUri": "eng-9747924", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

We deeply regret not being able to speak up while with the party. Once the jathedar summons us to Akal Takht and pronounces atonement upon us, we will launch the SAD Balch\u00e3o Lehar,\u201d she said.When asked about their expectations regarding the impartiality of the jathedar, given his appointment by the SGPC, which predominantly comprises SAD-aligned members, she said, \"We expect the jathedar to fulfil his responsibilities impartially and issue his directives accordingly.\"Sikh political analyst Parshotam Ajnala said, \"In this entire episode, both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress stand to benefit, while SAD faces gloomy days ahead due to its own mistakes and missteps.\u201dHe said he foresees a bigger plan working in the wake of the 2027 assembly elections and didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of some of the SAD rebels joining hands with the BJP and a few with Congress too.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone challenges the SAD\u2019s leadership in SGPC in the near future,\u201d Ajnala said.He observed that whether it's restructuring the party or seeking forgiveness at Akal Takht, SAD needs much more \u2014 \u201cthe trust of the people\u201d \u2014 to revive and reclaim its position at Punjab's political forefront, and once again embody the true essence of being a 'panthic party\u2019.", "summary": "The turmoil in the Akali party due to centralized power control, rebellion by senior leaders, and the challenges faced by SAD in regaining trust and reviving as a 'panthic party' are highlighted in the article.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sads-centralised-control-sparked-turmoil-rebellion/articleshow/111352728.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-72,width-1280,height-720,msid-111357216/111357216.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:14:28", "author": "Yudhvir Rana", "authors": ["Yudhvir Rana"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": -0.254}

That proposal, which needs a judge's approval, also sets the stage for schools to pay millions directly to athletes.\n\nThe full impact of the settlement is not yet known, but there are concerns that the chase for championships and big-time revenue is beyond the scope and interest of many schools.\n\nPeople are also reading...

There are another approximately 90 I-AAA schools without football that include basketball-focused athletic programs such as Gonzaga, Creighton and St. John's.\n\nOrganizers say their plan would keep their schools at the D-I level while giving athletes more control over governance without resorting to legal action and perhaps provide them with a chance to earn credits toward a degree for athletics.\n\n\"I think that the response has been very positive,\" said Tom Michael, athletic director at FCS school Eastern Illinois. \"I think people believe that we're down the right path. We understand we're not at the finish line. Nobody has suggested that this is the final version of this model.\n\n\"I think that there's an understanding that we need to be proactive on this and we can't sit and wait for somebody else to try to point us in the direction or create the pathway for us.\"\n\nThe group enlisted the Pictor Group as consultants last November. The plan has the stated mission of treating athletes more like other students and outlines a different role for coaches: Potential no-nos could include removing a player from a team as punishment or pressuring them to move into certain majors. Other proposals cover unreasonable time commitments, rules for appearance off the field and testing for recreational drugs.\n\n\"Obviously there's got to be some kind of control to compete at a high level but not exerting control of everything they do,\" Cone said of coaches. \"Those pieces are really critical to our model where the student-athletes are going to be very involved.\"\n\nFormer Abilene Christian football player Anthony Egbo Jr. and Radford volleyball player Meredith Page are among the athletes involved. They surveyed peers on what coaches expected of them and got some 100 responses to help formulate the model.\n\nEgbo told the Knight Commission audience that the increased professionalizing of college sports has created more desire for athletes to have more say \"in the development of policies that impact our experience.\"\n\n\"The question that we've been asking is: What if there's a better way for student-athletes to have influence over their experience that didn't have to go through judicial and third-party systems?\" Egbo said.\n\nThe guidelines are a way to steer away from any semblance of an employer-employee relationship. The National Labor Relations Board earlier this year found that Dartmouth exerted enough control over men's basketball players that they met the legal definition of employees. That case has been appealed by the school.\n\nMichael noted the proposals are not potentially earth-shattering changes as evidenced from a recent conversation with a league commissioner and a fellow athletic director.\n\n\"We kind of joked like, what we're talking about here isn't some novel approach,\" he said. \"It's really what we all got into this for and trying to bring it back to its roots of this model that's centered around education. We kind of laughed and were like, 'Wow, that's a novel idea.'\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Earlier this year, the National Labor Relations Board found that Dartmouth had enough control over the men's basketball players that they met the definition of an employee. The school appealed that case.\n\nThe new model looks to take away some of that control schools have over their student-athletes. According to the AP, \"potential no-nos\" for coaches could be removing a player from the team as punishment or pushing them toward a certain major. Other potential clauses could cover time commitments, rules for appearances off the field and testing for recreational drugs.\n\nThe proposal from smaller schools comes less than a week after a U.S. House committee approved a bill that would prevent student-athletes from being considered as employees of a school, conference or governing body like the NCAA. With that, it's up to the House of Representatives to vote or debate the bill.\n\nThere are 128 FCS programs and approximately 90 schools without football that are more basketball-focused programs. The West Coast Conference does not sponsor Division-I football (San Diego fields a football team in the Pioneer Football League). Notably, the Big East is considered a power conference in regard to the league's success in men's basketball despite not having football.\n\nWhile the aftermath of the House v. NCAA case is far from settled, the idea of student-athletes being considered as employees and thus eliminating amateurism in college athletics is a fear shared among leaders of smaller conferences. A report from The Athletic stated that the Johnson v. NCAA case, which argues in favor of student-athletes being classified as employees, could spell doom for some non-Power 5 athletic departments if student-athletes were able to unionize and were subject to minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nAfter agreeing to a landmark $2.8 billion settlement on three antitrust cases, the NCAA and its member institutions are seeking other avenues to generate extra revenue and help offset some of the damages. One such way the NCAA is considering is potentially expanding the NCAA Tournament to 72 or 76 teams.\n\nThe Big 12 could take matters into its own hands if it follows through on a one-of-a-kind private equity investment that could bring in up to $1 billion from a Luxembourg-based firm. The league is also reportedly considering selling its naming rights to the highest bidder, as is Conference USA, the American and Mountain West.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cole_forsman@si.com", "name": "Cole Forsman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_athlete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student athlete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship_Subdivision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzaga_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Big_Green", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dartmouth Big Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Labor Relations Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Five_conferences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power Five conferences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_East_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big East Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_USA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conference USA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naming rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Governing_Bodies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Governing Bodies", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Recruiting", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/College_and_University/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/College and University/Organizations", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/gonzaga_nation/01j0vqd41czb5mqw5a85.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668630", "eventUri": "eng-9668630", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 456616752, "relevance": 2}

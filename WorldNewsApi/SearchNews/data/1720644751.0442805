And how amazing \u2014 she\u2019s getting exactly what she wants,\u201d said the 38-year-old. \u201cShe\u2019s driven, and I think it\u2019s really paid off,\u201d added the \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d singer. Taylor recently touched down for her U.K. leg of the Eras Tour, where she is set to perform each of her albums \u2013 Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, Reputation, Lover, Folklore, Evermore, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department \u2013 for more than three hours. For performing 17 dates and stadiums like Wembley, the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer is reportedly estimated to boost the British economy to $1.2 billion. Taylor not only takes time to put on a well crafted show but also cares about fans\u2019 safety. In recent events, she had to pause her concert to help fans in need of assistance. Marren Morris brought attention to Taylor\u2019s devotion to creating a safe environment for fans during an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. \u201cThere was these signs on the inside of the barricades of her stadium shows and it says \u2014 basically to the local security, like \u2014 \u2018Fan-friendly show. Be kind\u2026So even to, like, the local security, her team saying, like, \u2018Don\u2019t mess with the fans. They\u2019re here to have fun.\u2019 And everyone\u2019s really respectful and I was like, \u2018Oh, I loved that,\u2019\u201d Marren shared. Not only have Lana and Marren backed her up in showing the mastermind of an artist that the \u201cShake It Off\u201dsinger can be, but other musicians chimed in on the subject to BBC. \u201cEscapism\u201d singer, Raye, voiced \u201cShe is just one of those rare timeless artists who gets it right every time. She\u2019s an absolute powerhouse.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s got the resilience and the chutzpah to be the boss of an enormous machine, employing thousands of people. To be able to handle that and handle what\u2019s coming at her publicly, you\u2019ve just got to be a one-off,\u201d added KT Tunstall. Not only will this pop star be traveling through the United Kingdom, but she will also be returning back to the states for a U.S. tour from October through November.", "summary": "Lana Del Rey said Taylor Swift 'wants it more than anyone.'", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2024/06/08/lana-del-rey-said-taylor-swift-wants-it-more-than-anyone/", "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lana-taylor-featured.jpg?quality=100", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:06:16", "author": "Jessica Acosta", "authors": ["Jessica Acosta"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.522}

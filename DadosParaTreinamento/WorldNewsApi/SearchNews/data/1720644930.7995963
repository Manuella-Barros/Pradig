Terri Dunlop was speaking ahead of the annual Female Walk/Run on Sunday in aid of Foyle Hospice, where her mother Jeanette spent her last days. Jeanette, an inpatient at Foyle Hospice until she sadly passed away at the age of 64 while holding her husband Terence's hand, was a school cleaner and child-minder in Derry before she became unwell.

Terri said: \u201cMum was very sick and we knew she didn\u2019t have much time left so we wanted to do more for her to keep her dignity and that\u2019s why we chose Foyle Hospice. \u201cEverybody was mad about her. She was so maternal and had such a great way with children. She had such a great personality and was the best mother to us all.\u201d Terri went on to praise the treatment her mother and her family received saying: \u201cThe staff at Foyle Hospice couldn\u2019t have done enough \u2013 they offered us a wee apartment because we were spending our days and nights up there. They were just amazing and as a family we are so thankful for everything they helped us through. \u201cMy mum celebrated her 64th birthday in the Inpatient Ward just three days before she died and the Hospice cook, Lisa, surprised us all with the most beautiful cake. It was exactly like the nightdress that she had on that day which had butterflies on it. We were so taken aback by this kind gesture.\u201d Explaining how relaxed her mother felt at Foyle Hospice which was a huge relief and peace of mind for Terri and her family, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think mum ever realised how sick she was \u2013 well that\u2019s how it seemed anyway because she was so relaxed in here. The nurses were just fantastic and if mum ever had any pain, they were straight on the ball. She was never hungry and her room was absolutely spotless \u2013 she was just so settled.\u201d Reflecting on her mother and father\u2019s relationship, Terri continued: \u201cMy mum and dad were childhood sweethearts, they met when they were 14, they were actually next-door neighbours! They were married 46 years and have five girls including me.\u201d On 15th January, at the age of 64, Jeanette passed away at Foyle Hospice while holding her husband, Terence\u2019s hand. Terri recalled how wonderful the nurses were at the time of her mother\u2019s death and the precious memories which she says she is very \u201cgrateful\u201d to have. She explained: \u201cMy mum was the type who didn\u2019t want any fuss and Foyle Hospice made her wishes come true. \u201cAs a family, we never thought it would happen to us, but losing my mum has made me realise how we take everything for granted in life.\u201d Terri concluded: \u201cWe never would have got through this without the Foyle Hospice \u2013 it was a home from home for us and the work they do is just amazing.\u201d If you would like to donate to Terri\u2019s Female Walk/Run Fundraiser you can do so by clicking this link For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "School cleaner and childminder Jeanette Dunlop was 'so maternal' with a 'great way with children'", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/daughter-taken-aback-kind-gesture-29314806", "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article29314817.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Jeanette-Dunlop.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:18:24", "author": "Niall Deeney", "authors": ["Niall Deeney"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.372}

Rush, who is attempting to hold 181 Guinness World Records at the same time to become the world\u2019s top record breaker, won the title for the fastest time to topple ten targets with a water pistol. He claimed that Guinness World Records required him to use a very small water gun, making it difficult to generate enough power to topple the cans while maintaining accu-racy. \u201cThe harder I squeezed, the worse my aim got.\u201d In conclusion, Rush stated that he was able to break the record of 5.93 seconds on his tenth attempt, but he made one more attempt and set a new record of 4.92 seconds.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"164\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/9-10.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div>David Rush, a popular serial world record breaker from Idaho, has earned his 178th concurrent\u00adly held title by using a squirt gun to topple 10 empty soda cans.

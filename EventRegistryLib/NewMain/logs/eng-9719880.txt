Additional images included in the caption are inset at the top left showing Tiffany Taylor Gray, at the top right displaying Audrey Miller, and at the bottom featuring foot impressions on the floor in Teklemariam's residence uncovered after investigators utilized Amido Black ink. All images are provided through courtesy of the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nPolice have arrested and now charged two women, Tiffany Taylor Gray and Audrey Miller, for the April murder of Fasil Teklemariam, a 53-year-old man from Washington, D.C., who was hit over the head, stabbed repeatedly and then had his thumb cut off and allegedly used by his killers to access his accounts and spend his money on Uber ride-shares, marijuana and alcohol.\n\nGray, 22, a resident of Prince George's County, Maryland, was arrested on July 1 and charged with first-degree murder and armed felony murder. She is currently being detained in Maryland and is expected to be extradited to Washington, D.C., to face the charges.\n\nPublicly available court records show Miller, 19, was arrested on June 21 for first-degree murder and armed felony murder as well. Though a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Miller on Tuesday, court records show it was vacated and rescheduled for July 30. She is being detained in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn an affidavit reviewed by Law&Crime, one witness who claimed to have overheard Gray describing involvement in Teklemariam's murder said the victim was Gray's \"sugar daddy\" but police have not been able to verify this claim.\n\nProsecutors allege Teklemariam was killed on April 1 though his body was not found inside of his bedroom until April 5.\n\nA police affidavit notes that his family tried calling him for several days and when they could not reach him, they contacted police. The victim's phone had repeatedly went to voicemail. Police said they spoke to one of Teklemariam's friends who informed them that the last time he had seen Teklemariam enter the apartment building was on April 1.\n\nOther witnesses later helped police identify Miller and Gray as familiar faces in the apartment building as well.\n\nPolice said when they found Teklemariam he had been hit on his head and stabbed multiple times. His right thumb was also gone. His thumb was never found. There was also evidence that the apartment had been scrubbed down in an attempt to remove any hint of the murder but officers said those efforts weren't fruitful: impressions of bloody footprints and other stains were uncovered at the scene once a special ink was applied to Teklemariam's floor.\n\nBut thanks to a litany of security cameras in his building and the surrounding neighborhood, investigators said they were able to piece Teklemariam's murder together. An affidavit also shows that authorities identified five total suspects including Gray and Miller. The other three suspects are Black males and only one has been positively identified to police as of Tuesday, a 34-year-old man who Gray has allegedly described to others as her \"play brother,\" records show.\n\nTypically, the term is used to describe someone who is not biologically related but familiar.\n\nNo charges have been filed against the other suspects at this time.\n\nFootage from Teklemariam's apartment on Peabody Street in Washington, D.C., showed that on April 1, he met Miller outside and brought her into the home willingly. Similarly, other security footage from that same evening appears to show Gray and her \"play brother\" parked outside of Teklemariam's building before finally entering it.\n\nIt was an unwitting resident who let them in, police said.\n\nPolice say other footage clearly shows the women and the other suspects coming in out of Teklemariam's apartment after the period in which investigators believe he was murdered. They are frequently seen \"carrying items\" to a car they had parked just near the apartment, police said.\n\nPolice said the suspects finally started to show up at Teklemariam' building with face masks or face coverings two days after the murder.\n\nAn affidavit says that it was witnesses who helped identify not just the women to detectives but even the bags they so brazenly carried out of the dead man's apartment.\n\nThree weeks after Teklemariam was killed, a witness came forward to tell police that they could identify the women and knew that they had \"cut the decedent's finger off.\"\n\nThis person told police that Gray went by an alias of \"Taylor Greene\" and that Teklemariam was her \"sugar daddy.\"\n\nThe witness claimed to have \"overheard\" something about Teklemariam being stabbed and further, that they overheard Gray describe police reports about the murder to her \"play brother\" and express shock that authorities found out so quickly.\n\nThe same witness told police Gray was seen using Teklemariam's thumb to obtain money from his accounts and confirmed she used the funds to buy Uber rides as well as \"weed, and alcohol.\"\n\nThe case broke open for investigators when they also learned that Teklemariam had filed a police complaint just a year ago alleging Gray had used his cellphone to steal $1,800 through one of his cash apps.\n\nAttorneys for the parties did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

She is currently being detained in Maryland and is expected to be extradited to Washington, D.C., to face the charges.\n\nPublicly available court records show Miller, 19, was arrested on June 21 for first-degree murder and armed felony murder as well. Though a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Miller on Tuesday, court records show it was vacated and rescheduled for July 30. She is being detained in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn an affidavit reviewed by Law&Crime, one witness who claimed to have overheard Gray describing involvement in Teklemariam's murder said the victim was Gray's \"sugar daddy\" but police have not been able to verify this claim.\n\nProsecutors allege Teklemariam was killed on April 1 though his body was not found inside of his bedroom until April 5.\n\nA police affidavit notes that his family tried calling him for several days and when they could not reach him, they contacted police. The victim's phone had repeatedly went to voicemail. Police said they spoke to one of Teklemariam's friends who informed them that the last time he had seen Teklemariam enter the apartment building was on April 1.\n\nOther witnesses later helped police identify Miller and Gray as familiar faces in the apartment building as well.\n\nPolice said when they found Teklemariam he had been hit on his head and stabbed multiple times. His right thumb was also gone. His thumb was never found. There was also evidence that the apartment had been scrubbed down in an attempt to remove any hint of the murder but officers said those efforts weren't fruitful: impressions of bloody footprints and other stains were uncovered at the scene once a special ink was applied to Teklemariam's floor.\n\nBut thanks to a litany of security cameras in his building and the surrounding neighborhood, investigators said they were able to piece Teklemariam's murder together. An affidavit also shows that authorities identified five total suspects including Gray and Miller. The other three suspects are Black males and only one has been positively identified to police as of Tuesday, a 34-year-old man who Gray has allegedly described to others as her \"play brother,\" records show.\n\nTypically, the term is used to describe someone who is not biologically related but familiar.\n\nNo charges have been filed against the other suspects at this time.\n\nFootage from Teklemariam's apartment on Peabody Street in Washington, D.C., showed that on April 1, he met Miller outside and brought her into the home willingly. Similarly, other security footage from that same evening appears to show Gray and her \"play brother\" parked outside of Teklemariam's building before finally entering it.\n\nIt was an unwitting resident who let them in, police said.\n\nPolice say other footage clearly shows the women and the other suspects coming in out of Teklemariam's apartment after the period in which investigators believe he was murdered. They are frequently seen \"carrying items\" to a car they had parked just near the apartment, police said.\n\nFrom April 1 to roughly April 5, Gray and two of the unidentified males went back into the apartment and accessed it by using Teklemariam's key fob. Police say as they hauled out their loot, other evidence suggested they may have been driving his Toyota RAV4 as well.\n\nPolice said the suspects finally started to show up at Teklemariam' building with face masks or face coverings two days after the murder.\n\nAn affidavit says that it was witnesses who helped identify not just the women to detectives but even the bags they so brazenly carried out of the dead man's apartment.\n\nThree weeks after Teklemariam was killed, a witness came forward to tell police that they could identify the women and knew that they had \"cut the decedent's finger off.\"\n\nThis person told police that Gray went by an alias of \"Taylor Greene\" and that Teklemariam was her \"sugar daddy.\"\n\nThe witness claimed to have \"overheard\" something about Teklemariam being stabbed and further, that they overheard Gray describe police reports about the murder to her \"play brother\" and express shock that authorities found out so quickly.\n\nThe same witness told police Gray was seen using Teklemariam's thumb to obtain money from his accounts and confirmed she used the funds to buy Uber rides as well as \"weed, and alcohol.\"\n\nThe case broke open for investigators when they also learned that Teklemariam had filed a police complaint just a year ago alleging Gray had used his cellphone to steal $1,800 through one of his cash apps.\n\nAttorneys for the parties did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [],

Blood was found on the bedroom floor.\n\nHe'd been stabbed and his right thumb was missing; court documents said it was removed either right before he died or afterward.\n\nBased on the findings of the autopsy, investigators believe he was killed several days before police were called to the apartment.\n\nIt appeared as if cleaning products were used in an attempt to hide evidence, court documents said.\n\nTeklemariam's thumb and his cellphone were missing from the home; neither have been found, according to court documents. Detectives also couldn't find his SUV, which was possibly seen being driven by one of the suspects back in April.\n\nTeklemariam was last seen alive April 1. Prosecutors said surveillance footage shows the man enter his apartment building with Miller.\n\nOver the next couple days, surveillance cameras captured members of the group going in and out of the apartment building where Teklemariam lived, prosecutors said. After using his key fob to get into the building, they walked out carrying bags holding Teklemariam's belongings such as his electronics.\n\nIn part, Gray was linked to the homicide because of an old complaint Teklemariam made to D.C. police last year. On Oct. 1, 2023, Teklemariam met up with Gray -- who he knew as \"Taylor\" and he said she left without saying goodbye. His phone was gone and a payment app was charged without his consent.\n\nThe thief allegedly stole $1,600, then another $200 from Teklemariam through his payment apps. A third attempted charge of $325 didn't go through.\n\nTeklemariam reported the theft to police.\n\nGray is accused of repeatedly scamming and stealing from potential romantic partners she met on dating apps in Prince George's County, Maryland. She's also accused of repeatedly concealing her identity from law enforcement.\n\nShe rented a unit at Landmark Apartments in College Park under a false name and had Teklemariam listed as her guarantor.\n\nCourt documents allege she met up with a person from a dating app at that apartment on May 1 and, along with two men, robbed him.\n\nAfter the victim entered her bedroom, she left the room and two men came inside. While armed, they ordered the victim to lay on the bed, and tied his hands and feet with zip ties, prosecutors said.\n\nWhile threatening to shoot him if he didn't comply, they stole his wallet and forced him to open his phone using facial recognition. They also demanded he provide the pin number for his bank account, according to court documents.\n\nGray allegedly left the apartment with one of the men to steal money from the victim's bank account. The group ended up leaving him in a closet, still tied up.

A search of [Teklemariam's] residence showed that several electronic devices and household items were stolen,' the criminal complaint alleges.\n\nThe documents confirm that cleaning supplies were used in the apartment but that a bloody shoeprint was recovered.\n\nPolice were led to Gray as a potential suspect when detectives discovered that in October 2023, he made a complaint to the DC police, accusing her of stealing his phone and running up charges of $1,800 on his banking app.\n\nThe search clues then found that Teklemariam's cellphone was pinged close to a cellphone tower in College Park, Maryland, close to where Gray was living at the time, Teklemariam was the guarantor on the apartment..\n\nMiller can be seen walking into Teklemariam's apartment building on April 1\n\nMiller and the victim seen entering his apartment on April 1, it's not clear what their relationship was\n\nMiller is seen in the hallway of the apartment building\n\nThe allegation that the victim was acting as the suspect's sugar daddy is mentioned in the criminal complaint and is attributed to 'witnesses.'\n\nInvestigators believe that Gray has 'repeatedly' committed the crime of meeting men online and stealing from them.\n\nIn one instance this past May, Gray is accused of meeting up with a man and then showing up at his home with two others, who were armed.\n\nThe group are accused of robbing the man while tying his hands and feet with zip ties.\n\nUnder threat of violence, the man revealed his banking pin codes.

Murder Suspects Finally Caught Because of...a Severed Thumb", "body": "The search for a suspect behind the butchered body of an alleged sugar daddy and suspicious sweep of his financial accounts has finally come to an end. Authorities say a torn ligament was the key toward solving the mystery.\n\nFasil Teklemariam, 53, was found dead in his Washington D.C. apartment in April, covered in stab wounds, cuts and pieces of broken glass, per an affidavit. His cause of death was ruled as a result of \"multiple blunt and sharp force injuries,\" per NBC. Also, his right thumb was missing, appearing to be severed from his hand, police say.\n\nThe search for suspects began by examining the residence's surveillance camera footage, which captured several people coming in and out of the victim's apartment, including Tiffany Gray, 22, and Audrey Miller, 19.\n\nThe police alleged the group was seen using Teklemariam's key fob to access his home, stealing various electronics and watches on their way out. They also said witnesses informed them Teklemariam had relations with the two women who may have had a hand in his killing. A look into a complaint he previously filed with the police last year helped cement the claim.\n\nRead more from NBC Washington:\n\nInvestigators got a break in the case when they learned of a complaint Teklemariam filed with D.C. police last year claiming Gray had taken his phone and used it to steal $1,800 his finance app, police said. Then investigators learned Teklemariam's cellphone last pinged from a tower in College Park, Maryland, not far from where Gray rented an apartment.\n\nA law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said the claim Teklemariam was Gray's sugar daddy has not been verified. Investigators do believe the victim's severed thumb was used to access his phone.\n\nFollowing the probe into the man's slaying, police believed Miler and Gray worked in tandem to steal money from his accounts with his severed thumb and use it to ball out on liquor and marijuana, among other things.\n\nPolice arrested Miller June 21 on charges of first-degree murder and armed felony murder.

Gray was arrested on July 1 in Maryland and is awaiting extradition to DC.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTOP-FM", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WTOP-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Gray_(racing_driver)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Gray (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_disparity_in_sexual_relationships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Age disparity in sexual relationships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunt_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blunt trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small intestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aorta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spinal cord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2-Women-Charged-With-Killing-'Sugar-Daddy-Using-His-Severed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719880", "eventUri": "eng-9719880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-05", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 238}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1611, "textEnd": 1618}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1647, "textEnd": 1654}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1677, "textEnd": 1683}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Audrey Miller, 19, and Tiffany Taylor Gray, 22, are also accused of cutting off the man's thumb in order to maintain access to his accounts.\n\nMiller and Gray were taken into custody separately in recent weeks, as authorities with the Metropolitan Police Department searched for suspects in the deadly stabbing of 53-year-old Fasil Teklemariam several months ago. Police said Teklemariam was found dead with multiple stab wounds and a number of other injuries inside the bedroom of his apartment on April 5.\n\nAmong the injuries was a missing right thumb, which had been cut off around the time of the killing or after Teklemarian's death, according to an affidavit for the arrests of Miller and Gray. They are two of five suspects listed in the affidavit. The others are men, with one of the three identified by police as 34-year-old Tommy Whack. He was charged in May in connection with the case.\n\nPolice said in the affidavit they found \"evidence suggesting that cleaning agents had been used to conceal and/or eliminate evidence to conceal or obscure the actions of the suspect or suspects who had committed the offense.\" Some evidence remained at the scene, including footprints.\n\nCCTV video from the lobby of Teklemariam's apartment building appeared to show both suspects were there on the evening he was killed, several days before police discovered the body. The footage also allegedly showed three of the suspects, including Gray, returned on April 3 at around 2 a.m., allegedly to steal several items that belonged to Teklemariam. Stills from the footage appear to show multiple people wearing hooded sweatshirts and masks as they enter the building, and again as they exit with their hands full of various items in bags and boxes.\n\nIn addition to the victim's thumb, police also said Teklemariam's \"cellphone, tablet, or any other such electronic device\" remain missing.\n\nA witness, referenced in court filings as someone involved romantically with one of the suspects, recognized Gray and Miller. Police said that witness told them Gray had visited the apartment building where Teklemarian lived at least twice before, and that he was her \"sugar daddy.\"\n\nThe same witness said in an interview with investigators that \"they, referring generally a group of involved people, cut the decedent's thumb off\" and \"also overheard something about the decedent being stabbed,\" the filings say. Police said the witness claimed to have observed Gray using Teklemarian's missing thumb to take money out of his account, pay for Ubers and purchase alcohol and other substances.\n\nThe witness told authorities that Gray may have used Cash App accounts to collect money from Teklemarian as well. Teklemarian had previously filed a theft report against Gray for allegedly having something to do with his then-lost phone and $1,600 in charges to his Cash App account, according to police.\n\nAfter learning the address of Gray's College Park, Maryland, apartment, police used surveillance tapes at the building, where none of the suspects were trying to conceal themselves, to discover their identities and eventually locate them. Gray and Miller both face charges of armed felony murder in the first degree in connection with Teklemariam's death.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Gray_(racing_driver)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Gray (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_App", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash App"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony murder rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Park,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Park, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "College Park, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l8fZZox1tV0_OR2.lvtQlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/f416cb412f11fb26e64d5e1a9b3819c3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719880", "eventUri": "eng-9719880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-05", "textStart": 653, "textEnd": 660}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-03", "textStart": 1606, "textEnd": 1613}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Metropolitan Police release.\n\nThe release added that 19-year-old Audrey Miller was arrested on June 17 in connection with his murder and was later charged with first-degree murder and armed felony murder.\n\nOn July 1, police said in a second statement that another suspect, 22-year-old Tiffany Taylor Gray of Bowie, Md., was also arrested and charged with the same crimes as Miller.\n\nNew charging documents obtained by WUSA, NBC News and the Washington Post reportedly stated that Teklemariam had been found dead inside a bedroom with \"blunt force\" injuries to his head and torso, several cuts on his legs and right hand and his right thumb cut off.\n\nAccording to autopsy results cited by WUSA and NBC News, the coroner determined that Teklemariam's body had been found between two to five days after he'd been killed and that his thumb had been removed while he was close to death or shortly afterward.\n\nInvestigators also noted that cleaning products had been used at his apartment, per WUSA -- though police were eventually able to identify a bloody shoe print by using a forensic crime scene tool,\n\nMiller was captured on camera in Teklemariam's building entering his apartment with him four days before he was found dead, reported WUSA, citing the court documents. She and Gray were also captured on camera coming and going from his apartment with two other men wearing masks and hoods a few hours later, the outlet added.\n\n\"The suspects stole several items from resident,\" the court documents said, per WUSA. \"A search of [Teklemariam's] residence showed that several electronic devices and household items were stolen.\"\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Investigators believe two women, identified as Tiffany Taylor Gray and Audrey Miller, cut off his thumb postmortem to unlock his phone and make unauthorized transactions using his financial apps.\n\nAccording to court documents, witnesses reported seeing Gray and Miller removing items from Teklemariam's apartment after his disappearance. Surveillance footage also captured them using his stolen credit cards for purchases. The police tracked Teklemariam's phone to a Maryland apartment rented by Gray, leading to their arrest.\n\nWhile the motive behind the murder remains unclear, a previous complaint filed by Teklemariam against Gray in 2023 alleges she had stolen money from his financial app using his phone. This suggests a possible financial dispute as a contributing factor.\n\nThe suspects are currently in custody awaiting trial on charges of first-degree murder and armed felony murder.

And two young women are the primary suspects.\n\nIn April, the remains of 53-year-old Fasil Teklemariam were found in his Manor Park apartment with \"several\" gory gashes all over his body, according to an arrest affidavit. He'd been stabbed in the stomach, cut on his legs, right hand, sustained fractures on his head... And oddly his right thumb was completely severed.\n\nCops believe Teklemariam was already dead for between two and five days before they found him, and his official cause of death was ruled as \"multiple blunt force\" and \"sharp force injuries,\" according to the affidavit. But why? Well, security footage and a witness have done a lot to help answer that very question.\n\nRelated: Missing 17-Year-Old Girl Found Dead -- ANOTHER Teen Has Been Charged With Her Murder!\n\nIn the days surrounding Fasil's murder, Audrey Denise Miller, 19 (above, left), and Tiffany Taylor Gray, 22 (above, right), were both seen coming in and out of the building in which the victim lived. And according to a witness, the latter was apparently a sex worker involved in a \"sugar daddy\"-type relationship with Fasil. And guess what? That severed thumb that was missing from the crime scene? The witness told investigators the duo used it to access Fasil's mobile banking apps to spend his money -- on weed and alcohol!\n\nHoly s**t!\n\nUpon reviewing more security footage, police discovered Audrey and Tiffany entering the building with two unidentified male accomplices across several days, once with cleaning supplies which are believed to have been used in the apartment. In charging docs, law enforcement even claimed \"several\" items were missing from Fasil's home upon investigation:\n\n\"The suspects stole several items from resident. A search of [Teklemariam's] residence showed that several electronic devices and household items were stolen.\"\n\nWow...\n\nBoth Audrey and Tiffany have since been arrested by DC's Metropolitan Police Department and charged with first-degree murder and armed felony murder, according to NBC Washington. Innerestingly, cops were led to Tiffany after uncovering an October 2023 police complaint made by Fasil, accusing the 22-year-old of stealing his phone and charging $1,800 on his banking app. The phone was found near a cellphone tower in College Park, Maryland, where Tiffany was living at the time in an apartment... Which had Fasil listed as the guarantor, according to the affidavit!\n\nSo yeah, sounds like \"sugar daddy\" was right on the money... So to speak.\n\nInvestigators have also revealed another instance of such crime under Tiffany's belt, citing a May incident in which she allegedly showed up at a man's apartment with two other armed individuals. The trio allegedly zip tied the man before robbing his home. More details (below):\n\nWow...

The Bhoiwada police registered an FIR against the accused, Sanjay Dattaram Satam, 54, on charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust. According to police, Satam first met the complainant in early 2022 at a medical camp in Konkan. The doctor is a devotee of 19th-century Marathi saint and social reformer Satam Maharaj, and the accused introduced himself to be a disciple with \u201cdivine powers\u201d, the FIR states. A few days later, Satam visited the complainant\u2019s place and while narrating about his background told the complainant that he has done a PhD from Oxford University and was an international lawyer having a chamber in the Supreme Court of India, Delhi. As per the FIR, Satam also told the elderly doctor that earlier he was posted as India\u2019s consulate in France and Portugal and most importantly that the (then) prime minister of Ireland Leo Varadkar is his aunt\u2019s son. He claimed to have good political influence and connections. Since the complainant doctor is an expert in giving Ozone therapy, Satam started frequenting his place in the name of taking the treatment. The accused gradually got close to the complainant as well as his son and daughter who live with him, the FIR states. The accused then assured the complainant of resolving a dispute the doctor had with a property in Pune by using his contacts in the government and the police department. After winning their trust, Satam even started looking after their bank related work in the name of helping them as the doctor had some vision issues and his son and daughter were suffering from depression, police said. In 2023, the doctor discovered that Satam was siphoning off money from his bank account. He obtained statements of his and his son\u2019s bank accounts, and discovered that Rs 42.50 lakh was transferred to the accounts of the accused, said a police officer. When the doctor confronted Satam, he admitted the crime and told him that he took the money as he was in some trouble. He assured the doctor that he would return all the money, but when he didn't return anything, the doctor approached police. Bhoiwada police are looking for Satam.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/man-claims-to-be-cousin-of-irelands-ex-pm-defrauds-doctor-9353493/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/leo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:22:08", "author": "Vijay Kumar Yadav", "authors": ["Vijay Kumar Yadav"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.047}

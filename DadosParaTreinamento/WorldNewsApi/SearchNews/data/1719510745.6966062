All these ingredients nestle between a warm, toasted sesame bun and are topped off with a bespoke mix of sweet ketchup, irresistibly creamy and spicy mayo, and oozy cheese.", "summary": "Burger King is launching a &quot;Kids Eat Free&quot; campaign from May 27 until June 2 - here's how you can get a free burger", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/burger-kings-kids-eat-free-29242254", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article27575229.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_burger-king-cov1PNG.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:23:39", "author": "Jordan Coussins", "authors": ["Jordan Coussins"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.657}

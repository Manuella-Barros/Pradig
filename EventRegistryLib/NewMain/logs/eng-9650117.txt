Like, that's it. And that feels so far away from now, but then again, it feels like we just played our first show on this tour because you have made this so much fun for us.\"\n\nSwift acknowledged that, throughout its run, the Eras Tour has \"become my entire life\" and \"taken over everything.\"\n\n\"I think once I had hobbies, but I don't know what they were anymore, because all I do when I'm not onstage is sit at home and try to think of clever acoustic song mashups and think about what you might want to hear,\" she said. \"Really, when I'm not on the stage, I'm dreaming about being back on the stage with you guys.\"\n\nSwift continued her speech by discussing the lengths her fans have gone to in order to attend the tour.\n\n\"You have done so much to be with us. You've made plans so far in advance, you planned what you were going to wear, you memorized lyrics, you got yourselves here, you figured out parking, you figured out transportation, and I want to spend the hundredth show just thinking about that, and living in this moment with you, and being here with you,\" she said. \"Just know that I appreciate every single ounce of effort that you've been [bringing] to being with us when this tour reaches triple digits of show.

With the final show just a few months away, fans hoped the singer would announce another leg due to popular demand. However, during her latest concert, Swift confirmed that sadly won't be happening.\n\nOn Thursday, June 13, Swift marked her 100th Eras Tour show in Liverpool, England. She addressed the big milestone by officially announcing her tour will be coming to a close this winter. When asked how she'll \"celebrate\" her 100th Eras Tour concert, the star said:\n\nThe celebration of the 100th show for me means this is the very first time I've ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December. Like, that's it.\n\nSwift said that December might feel \"so far away,\" but it'll probably come in the blink of an eye due to how much fun she's having. Although she kicked off her tour over a year ago, she still feels like it only just started since fans have made it so enjoyable for her. In fact, Swift has been loving performing for them so much that touring is all she's been thinking about lately. When she's not on stage, Swift said she's at home planning \"clever acoustic song mashups\" or anything else fans \"might like to hear.\"\n\nSince the end of the Eras Tour is just right around the corner, Swift told fans she'll try to be present for the rest of her shows as much as possible.\n\nI want to spend another show just thinking about that and living in this moment with you and being here with you and just know that I appreciate every single ounce of effort you put in to be with us when this tour reaches triple digits of shows. So thank you.\n\nIn March 2023, Swift kicked off her Eras Tour in Glendale, Arizona. After performing all over the United States, the singer went on to tour South America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. She's taken a few breaks in between different legs. Most recently, she went on hiatus in March following her shows in Singapore. After two months of R&R, Swift resumed her concerts by kicking off the European leg of her tour in May. Her European concerts will continue until August before she returns to the United States and Canada in the fall.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michele_mendez@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Michele Mendez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Touring", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/QTVR_and_Pre-rendered_VR", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/QTVR and Pre-rendered VR", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-ig.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650117", "eventUri": "eng-9650117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 298}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

She subsequently embarked on the international leg of the tour, making stops in South America, Asia, Australia and Europe. Swift also documented the concert experience in her October 2023 movie, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour.\n\nWhen Swift returned to her tour in May following a brief hiatus, she completely switched up the setlist, including songs from her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, for the first time while performing in Paris. In addition to making the record a permanent part of the lineup, Swift debuted new costumes and cut some past songs.\n\nThe European leg of the tour will run through August, with Swift returning to the U.S. for several shows in the fall before closing out the venture in Canada in December.\n\nSwift previously commemorated important dates on the tour with special surprises for her audience. During her 87th concert in Paris, she made several nods to boyfriend Travis Kelce, whose Kansas City Chiefs jersey number is 87. She wore his NFL team's colors and sang a mash-up of \"The Alchemy\" (which is rumored to be about Kelce, 34) and \"Treacherous.\" She even gave Kelce -- who was in the audience -- a sweet shout-out, asking the crowd, \"Can you believe this is our 87th show of the Eras Tour?\"\n\nWhile performing her 89th show in Sweden, Swift paid tribute to her 1989 album with a mash-up of three songs from the record: \"Say Don't Go,\" \"Welcome to New York\" and \"Clean.\"\n\nThroughout the tour's run, Swift has spoken about its impact on her.\n\n\"I've always had fun doing this. I can't believe I get to do music as a career. That's crazy,\" she said at the Los Angeles premiere of her Eras Tour movie in October 2023. \"I've always had so much fun doing it.

earthquake monitors 3.7 miles away.\n\nSwift is set to return to London in August to end the UK and European stint of the tour, which is estimated to be worth up to \u00a31 billion to the UK economy.\n\nHer last show will be on December 8 in Vancouver, according to her website.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [],

During Taylor Swift's recent performance in Liverpool, which marked the 100th show of the career-defining run, she confirmed that there won't be any additional dates extending the show into 2024. The tour is currently scheduled to conclude on Dec. 8 -- less than one week before the musician's 35th birthday -- with a final show in Vancouver.\n\n\"A lot of you are like, 'How are you going to celebrate the 100th show?' And for me, the celebration of the 100th show for me means this is the very first time I've ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is going to end in December, like that's it,\" Swift told the audience. \"And that feels like so far away from now, but then again, it feels like we just played our first show on this tour, because you have made this so much fun for us.\"\n\nThe Eras tour kicked off in March 2024 after being announced in November 2022. In December 2023, it became the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to ever gross at least $1 billion. Millions of fans went through what Swift herself compared to a bear attack in order to secure tickets for at least one show, even if it meant traveling to another country, while others managed to attend dozens of shows. The live event, split into sections to honor almost every album Swift has released in her career, was released as a concert film in October 2023.\n\n\"I think that this tour has really become my entire life. Like, it's taken over everything. I think I once had hobbies, but I don't know what they were anymore,\" Swift continued. \"Because all I do when I'm not onstage is sit at home and try to think of clever acoustic song mashups, and think about what you might want to hear. When I'm not on the stage, I'm dreaming about being back on the stage with you guys. And you have done so much to be with us, right?

Just know that I appreciate every single ounce of effort that you've put into being with when this tour reaches triple digits of shows.

After over 3.5 million Swifties pre-registered for Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program -- largest registration in Ticketmaster history -- Swift added an additional 17 performances.\n\nDuring the Ticketmaster presale, the website canceled the tour's general sale due to \"extraordinarily high demands\" -- and Swift herself took to Instagram to tell fans \"it really pisses me off\" that some fans felt they had to \"go through several bear attacks\" to secure their tickets.\n\nSince the initial domestic sale, the \"All Too Well\" singer has announced several additional legs to the \"Eras Tour,\" including dates in Latin America, Asia, Australia and Europe, as well as an additional North American leg. The last scheduled show -- the 152nd of the tour -- is in Vancouver on Dec. 8.\n\n\"Just know that I appreciate every single ounce of effort that you've put into being with us when this tour reaches triple digits of shows -- so thank you,\" Swift told the fans in Liverpool.\n\nAs fans descended upon Liverpool for the set of shows this weekend, they were met with what Liverpool City Council's Director for Culture Claire McColgan called in a statement \"pure pop heaven\" -- 11 city-commissioned public art installations, each meant to represent one of the superstars \"eras.\" Along what the city dubbed Taylor Town Trail, fans could snap photos on a gold throne adorned with snakes, emblematic of Swift's Reputation album, or a moss-covered piano much like the one Swift plays during \"Champagne Problems\" on her Eras Tour setlist.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nThe \"Anti-Hero\" singer's stop in Liverpool -- the birthplace of The Beatles -- comes not long after she surpassed a record set by the iconic English rock band. In February, Billboard reported that Swift had notched an eye-popping 384 cumulative weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart across all of her albums, souring past the Fab Four's long reign on top.\n\nAnd, as further proof of her global dominance, the \"Piano Man\" himself, Billy Joel, said to The New York Times of the Eras Tour in August: \"The only thing I can compare it to is the phenomenon of Beatlemania.\"\n\nIn anticipation of the fanfare surrounding Swift's first ever shows in the city, Merseyside Police said they had been working for six months to \"make sure the event is a safe one\" in a video posted to X (formerly Twitter).\n\n\"We're really looking forward to welcoming Taylor Swift and the Swifties,\" Chief Superintendent for Liverpool Zoe Thornton told fans in the video. \"We know Swifties look after each other so continue to do so.\"\n\nSwift's three-day stint in Liverpool follows a British Geological Survey report that found her last Eras Tour stop -- three shows in Edinburgh -- generated seismic activity that was detected at monitoring stations over three miles from the stadium. According to the agency, fan favorite \"...Ready For It?\" drew the most seismic activity, though her hit \"Cruel Summer\" was not far behind.\n\nFollowing three nights in Liverpool, Swift will jet off to Cardiff, Wales, for her next Eras Tour date.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

How He Recovered", "body": "Taylor Swift's upcoming projects include going back on the road for her record-breaking The Eras Tour. Yes, she's continuing her world tour, and she and her team continue to put on a great show every night, no matter the conditions. With the leg including the new Tortured Poets Department set fans are still being blown away by the three-hour concert. Recently, though, Swifties weren't the only ones being blown away as one of Swift's dancers was literally almost blown over by the wind. However, he recovered swiftly.\n\nTikTok user madznelvz shared a video from one of the Edinburgh shows where fan-favorite dancer Jan Ravnik was having a hard time keeping his stance during the show's intro, and it didn't help he had to carry a giant fan on his back. Luckily, he had someone standing behind him, helping him get to his mark as he tried to fight back the winds. A true professional.\n\nWhile the TikTok does only show Ravnik, it wouldn't be surprising if the other dancers carrying those giant fan-like objects were also being guided by someone else. The wind was rough enough that day, but when you have something that can help the wind more than yourself, it makes matters much more difficult. Add on the fact that you are in a stadium surrounded by thousands of people and the singer hasn't even taken the stage yet, and you have quite the situation on your hands.\n\nHowever, the team of dancers was prepared, and Ravnik was able to go on with the show without blowing over.\n\nThe weather has certainly proven to be a challenge for The Eras Tour. Between rain shows, storms that caused a concert to be delayed, heat waves, and incredible wind, this team has quite literally had to face the elements.\n\nDespite occasionally precarious weather, it seems like the dancers and Taylor Swift have been doing well on this leg as they continue playing sold-out stadiums. Even though the concert is as entertaining as ever, it's also thrilling to see how Swift, the dancers, backup singers, and the band do when the weather is not in their favor, but it's never anything they can't handle.\n\nWeather aside, there were several changes to The Eras Tour since The Tortured Poets Department's release. One mainstay was the surprise songs set, which Taylor Swift has been using for mash-ups as of late, rather than just two full songs. The tour is also still bringing out famous faces, as the Outlander cast attended a recent Eras show, and Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds were spotted with their kids at another one. Hopefully, their shows weren't as windy as this one.\n\nThere is a lot to look forward to from Taylor Swift aside from the Eras Tour, including the re-releases of Reputation and Taylor Swift. And you can bet we'll be here to tell you about all of it, including these unpredictable weather situations that show us just how professional and incredible the pop star and her team are.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_behnke@cinemablend.com", "name": "Megan Behnke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlander_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outlander (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reputation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpZNkhcvdg454gaCNvA8Eh-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9650117", "eventUri": "eng-9650117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Previously, she said that the concert covered 16 years.\n\n\"On the Eras Tour we have now reunited the sisters, combined them into one chapter,\" she said. \"You can call it Folklore, Evermore or you can call it the Sister Albums! You can call it whatever you want as long as you promise to sing 'Champagne Problems' with me.\"\n\nThe new setlist cut four tracks from the formerly individual eras, including \"'Tis the Damn Season,\" \"Tolerate It,\" \"The 1,\" and \"The Last Great American Dynasty.\"\n\nEras Tour Speak Now Set Updates\n\nSwift cut \"Long Live\" from the Speak Now era setlist. She also updated the set with an intro dance featuring Raphael Thomas and eight other dancers before she sang \"Enchanted.\"\n\nSwift officially launched the The Tortured Poets Department era of the tour after the 1989 set towards the end. She performed \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"So High School,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"Fortnight,\" \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\" and \"I Can Do It with a Broken Heart.\"\n\nSwift's 11th studio album was released on April 19 to much fanfare.\n\nThe 31-track collection -- which turned out to be a surprise double album -- features a hefty helping of heartbreak songs following her splits from Joe Alwyn and Matty Healy, as well as a few sweet love songs amid her current relationship with Travis Kelce.\n\n\"She has put her heart and soul into the music, just like with everything she does,\" a source told ET about the album, \"and can't wait for her fans to listen to it and to share it with them.\"\n\nSwifties predicted the singer would incorporate TTPD into her tour after Swift released a collection of new behind-the-scenes videos from what appeared to be tour rehearsals last month. The black-and-white clips are set to her current single, \"Fortnight\" featuring Post Malone, as part of her ongoing #ForAFortnightChallenge on YouTube Shorts.\n\n\"A fortnight 'til Paris,\" she captioned the post. The term \"Fortnight\" refers to a period of two weeks, a reference to the first of four Eras shows at Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena on May 9.\n\nSwifties wasted no time dissecting the images, taking note of what appears to be new props that could indicate the addition of TTPD songs to her already extensive setlist.\n\nET recently spoke to Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs superstar dating the pop star, during which he confirmed he'll be there with bells on for Swift's upcoming performances.\n\n\"There won't be a bad show, I promise you that,\" he said. \"You know I gotta go support.\"",

The \"Style\" singer was born on Dec. 13, 1989 -- with her birth year notably serving as the title of her beloved 2014 album -- and 13 is famously her favorite number.\n\n\"Me thinking Taylor's going to announce Rep[utation] [Taylor's Version] for the 100th show but she's really going to sit down at that piano and play yoyok [\"You're on Your Own, Kid\"] for the 100th time,\" tweeted one fan, referring to the rerecorded \"Reputation\" album that fans expected Swift to release last year.\n\nAnother fan joked that Swift woke up Thursday \"to see she's somehow announcing [Taylor's version of Reputation] and [her] debut [album], giving us a [music video], announcing more [tour] dates, giving us [The Tortured Poets Department] part 3 [and] a new unknown album all during tonight's 100th show.\"\n\nThe \"Guilty as Sin?\" singer announced last summer that her tour would get the concert film treatment and would hit theaters on Oct. 13.

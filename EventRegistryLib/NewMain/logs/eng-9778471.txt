While it's true that car buyers are voting with their wallets and opting for crossovers and SUVs, not every automaker has given up on the form factor, even when it comes to electric vehicles. For example, Audi's next EV will be the new A6 e-tron, which goes on sale in the US next year.\n\nThe pedants might quibble with calling the A6 e-tron a sedan, as the one we're getting here is a midsize five-door, meaning it has a rear hatch instead of a trunk. In Audi lingo, that means it's an A6 Sportback e-tron, with more of a two-box rather than three-box shape like the outgoing (internal combustion engine-powered) A6. Not that that's a bad thing in our eyes -- the rear hatch will make it easier to load or unload larger items (like a bicycle) into the cargo area.\n\n\"We were determined to give the A6 e-tron the attractive proportions of the concept car,\" said Audi designer Wolf Seebers. \"I'm talking about the classic Sportback silhouette that Audi fans are familiar with,\" Seebers said.\n\nGetting that silhouette wasn't especially easy. One reason that automakers and their designers have gravitated away from sedans as they make EVs is that it's a lot easier to package a slab of lithium-ion batteries between the axles when you have the extra height of a crossover or SUV to play with.\n\nFor the Porsche Taycan (and Audi e-tron GT, built on the same J1 platform), that meant laying out the battery so there were voids that created space for the rear passengers to put their feet, wonderfully translated from the German as \"foot garages.\"\n\nThe 100 kWh battery (94.4 kWh usable) in the A6 e-tron has no foot garages despite its lower floor, but sitting in the back I found adequate room for my lower extremities as opposed to sitting so my knees were level with my chest. That's because the A6 e-tron is actually a bit taller than Seebers and his colleagues would have liked otherwise. \"We developed the inlay in the rocker panel to introduce a horizontal cut to the car, adding another segment to the side profile to visually compensate for the additional height,\" he said.\n\nIt's a very slippery shape\n\nWhether or not you like the shape, it's hard not to be impressed with how aerodynamically efficient it is. The drag coefficient is just 0.21, or at least it is if the A6 e-tron is fitted with side view cameras. These aren't legal on US roads, so they won't be offered here, and we're not missing out -- as with the original Audi e-tron, the location of the screens is not ideal, and fitting conventional reflective glass side mirrors only increases the Cd to 0.22. And that's with wheels that range from 19-21 inches, no less.\n\nThe US will get three versions of the A6 when it goes on sale next year in either late spring or early summer. There's a 362 hp (270 kW) rear-wheel drive A6 Sportback e-tron, a 422 hp (315 kW) all-wheel drive A6 Sportback e-tron quattro, and a 496 hp (370 kW) S6 Sportback e-tron, which is also all-wheel drive and which can increase its output to 543 hp (405 kW) for short bursts using launch control.\n\nLike the Q6 e-tron we drove recently (which is also built using PPE), the battery pack runs at 800 V and so can DC fast charge at rates of up to 270 kW, which should take the pack from 10-80 percent state of charge in just 21 minutes. But we won't have EPA range estimates until closer to the car arriving here next year.\n\nNo Avant for America\n\nWhat we probably won't get here in the US is the A6 Avant e-tron, which is the station wagon version. Audi has no plans to import either A6 Avant e-tron or S6 Avant e-tron, because if the Venn diagram of people who say they love station wagons and people who buy new Audis intersects, the overlap is very small. The automaker may be a bit more willing to consider the idea when the RS6 e-tron arrives in a couple of years -- start your letter-writing campaign now if that's a thing you want to see happen.\n\nMuch of the rest of the A6 e-tron's details are very similar to the Q6 e-tron. The cabin layout is very familiar, although you feel more enveloped by the car from the front seats than you do in the SUV. There's the same \"Digital Stage\" -- Audi's name for the pair of screens that wrap around the driver -- and an optional third screen for the front seat passenger, which has an active privacy mode so the driver can't see anything on that screen while the car is in motion. The door cards are probably the biggest difference, Audi told us.\n\nThe lights are also quite similar in concept (if not shape) as the Q6 e-tron.

Audi also focuses on two body shapes and unveiled a Sportback and an Avant at the world premiere of the A6 e-tron. Audi's electric business cars rely on familiar technology - but with more range thanks to aerodynamics.\n\nThree years after the premiere of the A6 e-tron concept at the 2021 Shanghai Motor Show, the German carmaker has unveiled the production model. Following the presentation of the Audi Q6 e-tron SUV model, there are no big surprises in terms of technology - both models are based on the Premium Platform Electric, or PPE for short. However, the A6 e-tron is the first 'flat-floor concept' on the platform, as the Q6 e-tron and the Porsche Macan unveiled in January are SUVs, i.e.' high-floor concepts.'\n\nHowever, the flatter design does little to change the technical data. It uses the battery developed for the PPE with an energy content of 100 kWh gross or 94.9 kWh net. The latter can be charged with up to 270 kW at its peak, which should result in charging times of 21 minutes for the usual window of ten to 80 per cent. In other words, the A6 e-tron should be able to charge up to 310 kilometres in ten minutes. That is made possible by predictive thermal management of the battery; we described this in our background article on the PPE. Plug&Charge and 'bank charging' at 400-volt charging stations, as introduced in the Macan, are also available in the A6 e-tron. An 11-kW charger is installed for AC charging, with an optional 22-kW variant to follow later.\n\nAt the market launch, Audi combines the battery with two drive systems. The A6 e-tron Performance will initially be the base model with a 270 kW rear-wheel drive - a permanently excited synchronous machine that Audi manufactures at its plant in Gy\u00f6r, Hungary. The 370 kW S6 e-tron is an all-wheel drive model in which the PSM at the rear is combined with an asynchronous machine on the front axle. Audi states that further models with rear-wheel and all-wheel drive will follow at a later date \"depending on the market.\" As with the Q6 e-tron, a smaller battery with ten instead of twelve modules and an energy content of 83 kWh is assumed.\n\nIt is not yet known how much this base model of the A6 e-tron (presumably without the 'Performance' suffix) will cost.\n\nWith the large battery, the 'Performance' rear-wheel drive model should have a range of up to 750 kilometres according to WLTP, while Audi specifies 720 kilometres for the A6 Avant e-tron Performance. For the sporty S all-wheel drive, the figures are 670 and 640 kilometres, respectively, according to WLTP. By way of comparison, the Q6 e-tron Performance (with 240 kW rear-wheel drive) has a maximum range of 641 kilometres, while the 380 kW SQ6 e-tron quattro should drive up to 598 kilometres between charges.\n\nThe difference in this case is not a few kilowatts of power, but the bodywork. During the world premiere, Audi emphasised that aerodynamics is \"a key component of the company's long success story.\" For the saloon (now called the Sportback in the style of the four-door coup\u00e9s), Audi specifies a drag coefficient of 0.21; for the Avant, it should be 0.24. In terms of aerodynamics, the Sportback is said to be nothing less than \"the best Audi of all time and the best vehicle in the entire VW Group.\"\n\nAt the front, Audi uses air curtains to optimise the airflow. A new feature is a controllable cooling air intake under the Singleframe grille, which directs the airflow into or around the vehicle as required. There are also wheel spoilers and 3D bumpers in front of the front wheels, which are individually optimised for the Sportback and Avant, as well as covers for the rear axle and battery. The diffuser at the rear has also been optimised for \"the optimum balance between rear axle lift and cw value,\" according to Audi. Specially optimised wheel rims and the exterior mirror cameras familiar from the Q8 e-tron can also further reduce aerodynamic drag on the A6 e-tron.\n\nIn addition to aerodynamics, the design and utility value were also important when designing the body. Audi speaks of a \"clean design\" that \"focuses on dynamism, elegance and progressiveness.\" Overall, Audi designers looked to the familiar brand face of the Q6 e-tron: The LED daytime running lights are emphatically narrow and separated from the main headlights, and the Singleframe grille is completely closed and surrounded by a black mask. On the side, a black design element in the lower section of the doors symbolises the location of the important battery, as on other e-tron models. And at the rear, the new A6 is clearly recognisable as a current Audi - including a red illuminated brand logo.\n\nIn terms of the interior, the German manufacturer emphasises the size of the displays (11.9 inches for the cockpit display, 14.5 inches for the infotainment touchscreen and another 11.9 inches for the front passenger display), the further development of the second-generation head-up display and the \"home-like ambience\" of the interior, which is intended to offer an \"embracing feeling of space\" with \"softwraps\" (a design element that extends across the entire width of the vehicle from door to door) introduced in the Q6 e-tron. However, Audi still needs to specify the size of the boot, which is an important criterion, particularly for the Avant.\n\nThe new infotainment system uses Android Automotive OS as its operating system, although the look and menu navigation have been completely adapted to Audi's logic. The advantages relate to content and updates via over-the-air updates. Third-party apps such as YouTube or Spotify are also accessible via the 'Audi Application Store'. They can be integrated directly into the Audi system without going via the smartphone. There is also an 'Audi assistant' with access to ChatGPT so that \"researched content can be read aloud and you can interact with the car in natural language\" while driving. Only when the Audi system cannot answer general knowledge questions, for example, are they forwarded to ChatGPT. For drivers, this happens seamlessly, as all functions are integrated into the 'Audi assistant.'\n\nThe new A6 generation also has consequences for production: Until now, the model (as a combustion engine and hybrid) has been built at the Neckarsulm plant. However, the electric PPE model with the A6 in its name will be built in Ingolstadt together with the Q6 e-tron. Audi will rename the next combustion engine generation in this size class the A7 - as it recently did with the A4 successor as, the A5. The even digits denote the electric models, while the odd digits represent the combustion models.", "source": {"uri": "electrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "electrive.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_Q6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi Q6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_e-tron_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi e-tron (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Energy density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Harmonised_Light_Vehicles_Test_Procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_Shanghai", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto Shanghai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Macan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche Macan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charging station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternating current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingolstadt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ingolstadt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ingolstadt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckarsulm", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neckarsulm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Neckarsulm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.electrive.com/media/2024/07/audi-a6-e-tron-2024-10-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The A6 e-tron is exclusively available with fully electric powertrains, offering the option between Sportback and Avant bodystyles.\n\nFollowing the debut of the new model, the ICE-powered A6 is expected to be facelifted and renamed to A7, on par with Audi's new naming strategy that reserves even numbers for EVs.\n\nMore: 2025 Audi Q6 And SQ6 E-Tron Debut With Up To 510 HP And 388 Miles Of Range\n\nThe production version of the A6 e-tron looks very similar to the previewing concepts from 2021 (Sportback) and 2022 (Avant) respectively. Changes are focused on the slightly tweaked split LED headlights, the heavier use of black chrome around the body-colored grille, the conventional door handles, and the thicker full-width LED taillights at the back.\n\nThe company gave a lot of emphasis in the aerodynamics, with over 1,300 simulations and \"countless hours\" spent in the wind tunnel. As a result, the A6 Sportback e-tron is the most aerodynamic Audi of all time, with a drag coefficient of 0.21 Cd. This is better compared to direct rivals, but worse than the 0.20 Cd rating of the larger Mercedes-Benz EQS. Furthermore, the Audi A6 Avant e-tron is advertised as the most aero-friendly estate in its segment, with a drag coefficient of 0.24 Cd\n\nFrom the leaked photos published on Chochespias, the dashboard and center console appear to be largely carried over from the Audi Q6 e-tron. The highlight is the triple screen layout, including a 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.5-inch infotainment screen, and a 10.9-inch touchscreen for the passenger. These are joined by two extra screens for the digital mirrors.\n\nThe Audi A6 e-tron is based on the PPE architecture, just like the Q6 e-tron and the Porsche Macan EV. According to leaked info, the base A6 e-Tron Performance has a single electric motor producing 362 hp (270 kW / 367 PS), and a 94.6 kWh battery pack, offering charging speeds of up to 270 kW\n\nThe S6 e-tron upgrades to a dual electric motor setup, producing 496 hp (370 kW / 503 PS) or up to 543 hp (405 kW / 550 PS) when launch control is activated, taking it from 0-100 km/h (0-96 mph) in 3.9 seconds. In the future, the lineup will be expanded with the addition of the even more powerful RS6 e-tron performance flagship that has already appeared on spy shots.\n\nWe will update this story with more information when the official debut takes place later today.", "source": {"uri": "carscoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carscoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thanos_pappas@carscoops.com", "name": "Thanos Pappas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_e-tron_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi e-tron (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drag coefficient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_Q6", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi Q6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facelift_(automotive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facelift (automotive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_EQS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz EQS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_tunnel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind tunnel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audi A6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_plating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chrome plating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Audi-A6-Avant-E-Tron-main.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Second of Audi's cars to be based on the new PPE (Premium Platform Electric) -- the architecture for high-end EVs that was co-developed with Porsche -- the A6 e-tron promises sleek Sportback sedan styling with a clear aerodynamic advantage, and that should add up to highly competitive range numbers. Meanwhile, inside are the sort of gadgets that you'd expect from a high-end Audi model.\n\nAudi already showed us the 2025 Q6 e-tron, the first of the automaker's models to use PPE, while Porsche will also use the architecture for the fast-approaching 2024 Macan Electric. However, the A6 e-tron is likely to be the first \"low floor\" vehicle -- as opposed to a \"high floor\" SUV or crossover -- to do so.\n\nThings haven't changed much from 2021's Audi A6 e-tron Concept. Just as we said three years ago, the show car was a barely-disguised preview of the production A6 e-tron.

That leaves automotive designers and product planners with a decision: Should new cars advertise their powertrains, with different designs for EVs and gasoline models? Or is consistent branding more important?\n\nThe Audi brand name holds prestige no matter what kind of car the automaker's four-ring logo is attached to. The German automaker does expect to stop making combustion cars eventually, but like many established automakers, it doesn't expect the road to that point to be a straight line. So Audi is revamping its gasoline cars while continuing to expand its EV lineup -- with largely common styling features between them.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIn a repurposed industrial facility just outside Munich, Audi recently gave Digital Trends and other media a sneak peek at two crucial new models. The 2025 Audi A6 e-tron is an all-electric replacement for one of Audi's longest-running combustion models, while the 2025 Audi A5 marks a fresh investment in internal-combustion vehicles.\n\nAll-EV, eventually Previous Next 1 of 5\n\n\"The target portfolio of Audi's future will be an all-electric portfolio,\" Audi CEO Gernot D\u00f6llner told Digital Trends and other media during a Q&A. D\u00f6llner said earlier this year that Audi would introduce its last combustion model in 2026, but indicated the automaker isn't locked into that long-term goal.\n\n\"Nobody knows how fast the electric transition will happen,\" D\u00f6llner said, which is why combustion models are still part of the plan for now. Audi will determine its pace based on customer demand and changes to regulations.\n\nAudi doesn't expect the road to electrification to be a straight line.\n\nIf tougher European regulations remain in place (they're due for reevaluation in 2026), Audi could stop selling combustion cars there by 2033. The United States has put a new round of emissions rules into place for model years 2027 to 2032, but they still allow for combustion models.\n\nAudi's medium-term solution is a zipper lineup, with even-numbered models powered by combustion engines, odd-numbered models powered by batteries, and hybrid versions of some nameplates added in as well. Hence the 2025 Audi A5 is actually a replacement for the Audi A4 sedan, as well as the current A5 coupe/convertible/hatchback. The A6 e-tron will become the sole A6 variant once a new Audi A7 arrives to replace the current combustion version of that sedan.\n\nSimilar styling for EVs and combustion models Previous Next 1 of 5\n\nThis new naming scheme seems a bit confusing, even compared to the approaches of Audi's main rivals. Mercedes-Benz has its EQ sub-brand, with doppelg\u00e4ngers of its traditional gasoline luxury cars defined by polarizing styling and oversized screens. BMW has waffled between building dedicated EVs like the iX SUV and making electric variants of its combustion models like the i5, an all-electric version of the 5 Series sedan that has traditionally been one of the A6's main competitors.\n\nAudi seems to want to highlight which of its cars are electric without making too big of a deal out of it. That's also the case with the A6 e-tron's styling. Unlike the i5, it's not just a combustion sedan refitted with an electric powertrain. But it blends in more than the pebble-shaped Mercedes-Benz EQE sedan, its closest rival in the EQ lineup.\n\nMoving between rooms where the cars sat under studio lights, we saw a strong family resemblance between the A6 e-tron and the new A5. That's what Audi was going for.\n\nThe difference between the gasoline A5 and electric A6 e-tron is mainly in the details.\n\n\"In general, the design language should be independent [of whether] it's a combustion-engine or battery-electric [vehicle],\" D\u00f6llner said.\n\nThe difference is mainly in the details. The A6 e-tron and other Audi EVs have a contrasting grille (to highlight that it's a nonfunctional decorative element) and a piece of trim along the doors to represent the battery pack. The A5 hints at its combustion engine with a hood bulge and prominent exhaust tips. Both the A5 and A6 e-tron will be sold in the U.S. exclusively as sedans with rear hatches instead of conventional trunks; other markets get handsome Avant wagon body styles as well.\n\nShared tech, different platforms\n\nAudi also won't limit the latest infotainment tech to its EVs. The A5 gets the same E3 1.2 electrical architecture as the A6 e-tron. This architecture, which debuted in the Q6 e-tron electric SUV, comes with a three-screen display setup that includes an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster, 14.5-inch touchscreen, and 10.9-inch front-passenger screen that's common to both the combustion A5 and electric A6 e-tron.\n\nThe similar exterior styling themes and interior tech features bely the fact that these two cars are based on different underpinnings. The A6 e-tron is built off the same Premium Platform Electric (PPE) as the Q6 e-tron and the electric version of the Porsche Macan. It uses a \"low floor concept\" version of the PPE with rearranged suspension and other components that allows this sedan to sit lower than the Q6 e-tron SUV. The A5 debuts the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) that will serve as the basis of most future Audi combustion models, but has nothing in common with the PPE architecture.\n\nAudi also won't limit the latest infotainment tech to its EVs.\n\nIn the U.S., the A6 e-tron will be offered in single-motor rear-wheel drive and dual-motor all-wheel drive guises making 362 hp and 422, respectively. A sportier S6 e-tron dual-motor model bumps output to 496 hp, or 543 hp with its launch control system engaged. That system will also scoot the S6 from zero to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds with minimal drama. The A5 will be sold in the U.S. with a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine and all-wheel drive; an S5 performance variant will also be available with a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6.\n\nAll A6 e-tron models have a 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack with 94kWh of usable capacity. Audi hasn't released range figures for the U.S., but said all A6 e-tron models will be able to DC fast charge at up to 270 kilowatts, completing a 10%-80% charge in 21 minutes. However, the U.S.-spec version misses out on some tech features available in Europe, including camera side mirrors and the ability to program animated lighting signatures.\n\nA cautious approach\n\nLegacy automakers have built businesses on selling cars powered by fossil fuels, otherwise it wouldn't have taken a startup like Tesla to evangelize EVs. But EVs have since rekindled interest in cars among non-enthusiasts. Automakers are also under more regulatory pressure than ever to lower emissions, and more shareholder pressure to pursue EVs in the hope of duplicating Tesla's stock price.\n\nThe shareholders are quickly finding that making more EVs doesn't automatically make the share price go up, and cost and infrastructure concerns are still causing car shoppers to hold back, which means combustion models will likely be with us for a little while longer. In that context, Audi's approach of using design to keep its own brand in the foreground to create a blended family of gasoline and electric models is cautious, but sensible.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_edelstein@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Stephen Edelstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_e-tron_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi e-tron (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Trends", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Digital Trends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A5", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audi A5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audi A6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_EQE", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz EQE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_iX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW iX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luxury car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DSC_0041.jpeg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

What's more, the A6 E-Tron Sportback's sleek profile makes it the most aerodynamic Audi ever, with a drag coefficient of 0.21.\n\nThat's impressive for any full-size fastback, but especially valuable for an EV that can squeeze more miles per charge from that lower drag. Thanks to Audi's focus on aero, the A6 E-Tron Sportback will have a range of over 466 miles based on the WLTP test cycle. That number will naturally decrease in EPA testing, but it's still a sign of the industry's progress in its relentless push for EV efficiency and energy density.\n\nAudi says that the A6's design puts it above not just all other Audis in terms of aerodynamics, but also above all other vehicles currently made by Volkswagen Group. However, the A6 E-Tron Avant won't match the Sportback, with its drag coefficient of 0.24 and slightly lower maximum range. It is a wagon, though, so we'll forgive its disadvantages on paper. Just don't get too excited, because Audi's first fully electric Avant has not yet been confirmed for the States.\n\nThe A6 E-Tron will come to America in three Sportback versions: a 362-horsepower rear-wheel-drive base model; a 422-hp Quattro; and a 496-hp S6 (with 543 hp for launch control). Torque distribution is rear-biased across all models, and the Sportback tips the scales at 4,795 pounds.\n\nThe Sportback's slippery shape is further optimized thanks to many small design elements, which are as much about function as they are form. Air curtains manipulate flow at the front and at all four corners, while the optional 21-inch wheels come equipped with plastic aero covers. The EV's virtual exterior mirrors can also tuck in toward the body, and an optional air suspension lowers the big sedan by up to 0.8 inches depending on speed.\n\nWedging the battery pack into the new A6 E-Tron raised its height, of course, so Audi designers counterintuitively outlined the battery with a black insert at the door sills, in an attempt to carve a leaner profile.\n\nAll versions have the same usable battery capacity of 94.4 kWh and peak charging rate of 270 kW thanks to PPE's 800-volt architecture. And just like the Q6, the A6 E-Tron can also split its single battery into two 400-volt packs via bank charging, to make the most of stations employing lower standards. The A6 E-Tron can go from 10% to 80% capacity in 21 minutes via DC fast charging, and recover up to 193 miles in 10 minutes. Again, that's on the WLTP cycle, so U.S. mileage will vary. But you can spend some of those minutes playing Audi's in-house developed video games on the heads-up display, which now boasts stereoscopic 3D effects.\n\nThe interior has all the other creature comforts of Audi's latest EV platform, including ChatGPT-enabled Android Automotive infotainment with up to three displays. An 11.9-inch virtual driver's cockpit is combined with a 14.5-inch OLED center screen in a continuous curved display, while a 10.9-inch screen for front passengers is optional. There's a Bang & Olufsen sound system with four headrest speakers at the front, and another 16 speakers throughout the cabin driven by 830 watts of amplification.\n\nThe A6 E-Tron Sportback will get an overall more luxe interior than the Q6 E-Tron, adding exclusive soft-close doors and a new panoramic glass roof that dims at the touch of a button. Audi calls this a \"digital curtain,\" and it comes with four presets. But all the new high-speed tech isn't limited to the EV drivetrain and interior, as Audi's new customizable Matrix LED headlights and OLED taillights also come standard.\n\nRegulations in the U.S. are still hampering active lighting, so we won't enjoy the neat effects that allow the A6 E-Tron to communicate with others on the road via light show. Still, U.S. models will likely get those objectively cool illuminated rings at the rear as a consolation prize.\n\nWhile the A6 E-Tron's exterior isn't as sleek as the longstanding ICE-equipped A6 sedan, Audi's new electric four-door is, at least, a nearly perfect recreation of the concept that previewed it three years earlier. Love it or hate it, the design language of Ingolstadt's new EVs is here to stay, but the A6 delivers meaningful upgrades to the brand's electric lineup. Pricing for the U.S. is unknown, but the A6 E-Tron will start at \u20ac63,000 (about $63,136 at current exchange rates) in Germany when orders open in September.", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_rodriguez_jr@thedrive.com", "name": "Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Jr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drag coefficient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi A6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Harmonised_Light_Vehicles_Test_Procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-size_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full-size car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_&_Olufsen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bang & Olufsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingolstadt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ingolstadt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ingolstadt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/A243274_large-3-e1722399605209.jpg?w=2188", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

This new A6 Sportback E-Tron fills a big void in the lineup. After several crossovers and SUVs, the German luxury brand is finally launching an electric sedan. Well, it has a tailgate, which technically makes it a liftback if you don't think the term hatchback is correct. This is effectively Audi's belated answer to the BMW i5 and the Mercedes EQE.\n\nUnlike the i5 which shares its CLAR underpinnings with the 5 Series, the new A6 E-Tron is built on a dedicated EV architecture. The Premium Platform Electric (PPE) is the same used for the recently launched Q6 E-Tron, a BMW iX3 competitor. In addition, the hardware can also be found underneath the new Porsche Macan, an electric-only crossover.\n\nIt's a stylish car that could've looked even better without the split headlight theme some BMWs have also embraced. Audi says the A6 Sportback E-Tron is its most aerodynamic production car in history thanks to a drag coefficient of just 0.21. The low Cd is partially made possible by the implementation of side cameras and aero-optimized alloy wheels.\n\nCustomers will get to pick from rear- and all-wheel-drive flavors of the A6, plus a hotter S6. The base model is the first modern Audi sedan with a RWD layout. It has 362 horsepower and does 0 to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds, en route to 130 mph (210 km/h). Go for the Quattro and output jumps to 422 hp. This dual-motor variant reaches 60 mph from a standstill in 4.3 seconds while having the same maximum speed.\n\nThe dual-motor, Quattro-equipped S6 E-Tron will be the king of the hill. Well, until Audi comes out with a full-fat electric RS6. Meanwhile, the highest-performing derivative packs a 496-hp punch. Activate launch control and you get 543 hp, reducing the sprint time to 3.7 seconds. The sportier variant maxes out at 149 mph.\n\nThere aren't any battery options since Audi fits all A6 and S6 models with the same lithium-ion pack featuring a net energy content of 94.4 kWh. The German luxury brand promises more than 750 kilometers (466 miles) of range for the rear-wheel-drive model. Going for the S6 means you'll be sacrificing some of the efficiency since the range will drop to 670 kilometers (416 miles). It's worth mentioning these are not the WLTP figures but rather Audi's own estimations.\n\nOnce you're out of battery juice, the fully electric A6 can be recharged at 270 kW thanks to its 800-volt technology. It'll take 21 minutes to go from 10% to 80%. Ten minutes spent at the charging station will give you 310 kilometers (193 miles) of range.\n\nInside, there's a screen-heavy dashboard with an 11.9-inch driver's display, a 14.5-inch infotainment, and an optional 10.9-inch screen for the front passenger. On top of that, customers can order the car with a new generation of Audi's head-up display featuring augmented reality tech. Speaking of things that cost extra, the panoramic sunroof takes advantage of polymer-dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC) to switch from opaque to transparent at the touch of a button.\n\nAudi will open the order books in September and charge \u20ac75,600 at home in Germany for the A6 Sportback E-Tron. The i5 M60-rivaling S6 Sportback E-Tron kicks off at \u20ac99,500. Much like BMW has the i5 Touring with an electric M Performance version, there's also an A6/S6 Avant E-Tron wagon.", "source": {"uri": "bmwblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BMW BLOG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "horatiu_boeriu@bmwblog.com", "name": "Horatiu Boeriu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drag coefficient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_EQE", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz EQE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liftback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liftback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trunk (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Macan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche Macan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_X3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW X3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW 5 Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hatchback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alloy wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_to_60_mph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "0 to 60 mph"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Audi-A6-Sportback-E-Tron-23.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Source: Audi / Facebook\n\nThe German automaker Audi is preparing to present an updated A6 e-tron model, which will now be equipped with an electric motor. On the eve of the official presentation scheduled for today, July 31, the automaker decided to show real photos of the sedan and wagon.\n\nThe pictures were published on Audi's social media. However, you still can't see many details in the pictures. The photos were taken at dusk so that only the outlines of the new A6 for the 2025 model year could be seen against the barely lit sky.\n\nWhat we can say for sure is that the designers have tried to preserve the elegance of the shapes inherent in Audi models. The photo also shows matrix headlights and thin LED lights.\n\nAlthough the manufacturer keeps the official information about the new model a secret, some have already managed to take several shots of the test models. From their pictures, it can be assumed that the new electric vehicles will have separate headlamp units and fully enclosed grilles. Instead of side mirrors, the A6 will have cameras, and the door handles will be recessed.\n\nIt has also already been reported that the 2025 A6 e-tron will be built on the PPE platform, just like the Q6 e-tron. This suggests that the electric vehicle will receive a battery with a capacity of about 100 kWh. Analysts also expect that there will be several powertrain options on sale. Thus, they predict the launch of a rear-wheel drive version with a capacity of 302 hp and a range of up to 641 km. An all-wheel drive modification with two engines with a total capacity of 382 hp and a range of up to 625 km is also possible.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_e-tron_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi e-tron (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi A6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/31/zobrazhennya2024-07-30111817442.png?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 261, "textEnd": 268}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

It will be available in both Sportback (five-door sedan) and Avant (wagon) body styles in Europe, but only the former will make it to our shores.\n\nSimilar to the Q6 e-tron crossover, which is closely related to the new Porsche Macan EV, the A6 e-tron will also offer a sportier model called S6 e-tron. The Q6 and A6 lineups naturally share many styling cues and components.\n\nAs a reminder, the Audi A6 e-tron originally debuted at Auto China in Shanghai three years ago in the form of a wagon concept. The production model will go on sale in Europe this fall followed by North America sometime in 2025.\n\nThe A6 e-tron Sportback boasts an amazing drag coefficient of 0.21 thanks to a wind-slicing profile combined with a number of aerodynamic solutions such as air curtains up front, flush-mounted door handles on the sides and a subtle lip spoiler in the rear. Euro-spec models will even replace the side mirrors with next-generation cameras, but that won't be the case in North America.\n\nHowever, the A6 e-tron coming our way will be the first in the world to feature an illuminated four-ring logo at both ends (Europe only gets one in the rear due to road safety legislation). Drivers will have a choice of eight different lighting signatures, just like with the Q6 e-tron. The base model rides on 19- or 20-inch wheels, while the sportier S6 e-tron rides on 20- or 21-inch alloys. Staggered tires are found on all of them.\n\nWhen it comes to cargo, look for 502 litres of space with the rear seats up or 1,330 litres with the seats folded down. There's also a front trunk, or frunk, that can fit up to 27 litres of extra gear. It opens automatically when the driver sweeps their hand over the four-ring badge. For the rear hatch, it's just a matter of placing one's foot over the Audi logo projected onto the ground.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the A6 e-tron and S6 e-tron use the same 100kWh battery (94.9kWh net capacity) and 800V electric architecture as the Q6 e-tron and SQ6 e-tron. Maximum range is estimated at around 545 km for the A6 e-tron and 520 km for the S6 e-tron based on the U.S. EPA test cycle.\n\nDC fast charging is possible up to 270 kW, meaning the battery can go from 10-80 percent in as little as 21 minutes. When plugged into a level-2 AC charger, 11 kW of power are available.\n\nA regenerative braking system enables energy recuperation up to 220 kW, according to Audi engineers, with the paddles on the steering wheel allowing drivers to select the level they desire. With \"B\" mode on, one-pedal driving is possible.\n\nWhile the base car delivers a solid 362 horsepower, the S6 e-tron increases output to 405 horsepower and even 543 horsepower with Launch Control activated. Acceleration times (0-100 km/h) are 5.4 seconds and 3.9 seconds, respectively.\n\nThe standard suspension consists of steel springs, but an adaptive air suspension is optionally available (standard on the S6 e-tron). Front chassis geometry has been tuned to maximize handling. Ditto for steering. Another thing you should know is that the S6 e-tron is designed with a rear-motor bias to give it a sportier character and feel.\n\nA highlight inside the Audi A6 e-tron and S6 e-tron is what designers call the \"Digital Stage,\" a curved digital display combining an 11.9-inch instrument cluster with a 14.5-inch touchscreen for infotainment. Optionally, a third display in a size of 10.9 inches can be added on the passenger's side for streaming content (which can't be seen from the driver's point of view).\n\nAlso optional is an electrochromic glass roof that goes from opaque to transparent at the push of a button. It can even be split into sections allowing a different amount of sunlight to pass through.\n\nThe Car Guide will soon be spending time behind the wheel of the new 2026 Audi A6 e-tron and S6 e-tron, and we expect both models to handle much like the recently tested albeit larger Q6 e-tron and SQ6 e-tron since they're all based on the same platform and equipped with the same powertrain components.

And for those who might want a sportier version, the S6 Sportback E-Tron was just revealed alongside it.\n\nIf you're already familiar with the Q6 E-Tron - an electric SUV we've already driven - then you're mostly up to date on the underpinnings and inner workings of the A6 Sportback E-Tron. Built on the PPE platform (also shared with the Macan Electric), the A6 Sportback E-Tron will come in both RWD and Quattro AWD forms. The RWD version is fitted with a single electric motor good for 362 horsepower, a 0-60 mph time of 5.2 seconds and a 130 mph top speed. Step up to the Quattro, and Audi adds a second electric motor to the front axle for a combined output of 422 horsepower, lowering the 0-60 mph time to just 4.3 seconds. Meanwhile, the S6 Sportback E-Tron is even quicker, with a combined output of 496 horsepower, or 543 horsepower for a quick burst when using launch control. The 0-60 mph time drops to just 3.7 seconds when you activate the launch, and top speed ticks up to 149 mph.\n\nEvery version of this Sportback (both A6 and S6) uses the same 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack, with 94.4 kWh usable. EPA range figures aren't available now, but WLTP estimates are. Audi says the RWD A6 Sportback E-Tron can go \"over 750 kilometers,\" which is about 447 miles. Meanwhile, the S6 Sportback E-Tron is estimated at about 398 miles of range. Expect the EPA numbers to be well below these estimates. What we know will be impressive are the charging specs. The system's 800-volt technology helps Audi to a maximum charge speed of 270 kilowatts, which Audi says allows for a 10-80% charge in just 21 minutes. You'll still be able to fast-charge on charging stations with 400-volt technology, too, as the A6 E-Tron can split its battery into two banks with a voltage of 400 volts each, allowing them to be charged in parallel at up to 135 kW. For those home charging, a 22 kW AC charging option will be available later with 11 kW charging available at launch.\n\nIt's not currently slated for U.S. sale, but a smaller 83-kWh battery model will be sold in other markets.\n\nAudi S6 Sportback e-tron View 31 Photos\n\nAs for the car's design, the theme of the day is smooth and clean. It has a similar bulkiness to its lower half as the Macan Electric does, emphasized even more by the black insert in the sill area, which Audi says is there to highlight its floor-mounted battery design. Its grille design is reminiscent in shape/style to the Q6 E-Tron, and Audi also sticks with the separate DRL/headlight modules, effectively trying to hide the actual headlights in the car's front mask of black-painted trim.\n\nLight plays a big role in this car's design, but some of its coolest features like the active digital light signatures and adaptive matrix LED headlights are not available due to U.S. regulations. Nevertheless, the A6 Sportback E-Tron is fitted with some seriously rad-looking OLED front and rear lights with customizable light signatures (up to eight in the U.S.) you can choose from. Even the four rings logo is lit, so you'll always know an Audi is approaching or driving away from you at night with only a short glance.\n\nWe don't have an aero figure for the U.S., but Euro-spec A6 Sportback E-Trons sure are slippery with a 0.21 coefficient of drag when optioned with Audi's second-generation digital camera mirrors. Its sportback shape means it'll be utilitarian with a hatchback opening rear end. Plus, while we don't have specs yet, the rear seats look spacious and well-designed with an almost entirely flat floor.\n\nTech galore dominates the front of the cabin, as a 14.5-inch touchscreen infotainment display is mounted in the center alongside an 11.9-inch digital cluster, 10.9-inch front passenger display and new augmented reality head-up display. That passenger display has an \"Active Privacy Mode\" that ensures the driver can't see the movies or shows the passenger is streaming on it while driving. The infotainment system uses Android Automotive OS for its operating system and can be updated over-the-air. Its voice control system has greatly improved, Audi says, and even features integration with ChatGPT to ensure it can answer practically any question you might throw at it.\n\nAudio playback can optionally come through a 20-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system that features headrest speakers for things like navigation announcements or a phone call you might not want the whole car to hear. Above your head is an optional smart panoramic glass roof that can be switched from transparent to opaque at the touch of a button, allowing you to either let light in or block it out.\n\nAudi says the A6 Sportback E-Tron offers an optional adaptive air suspension system that moves through four different ride height levels. It specifically calls out an \"efficiency\" mode that moves the body down by about 0.8 inch to improve aerodynamics and range. As for performance, Audi says the S6 Sportback E-Tron has a more rear-biased AWD system and also offers variable torque distribution. Both the A6 and S6 versions are equipped with staggered tires in an effort to improve stability and sportiness, too.\n\nThe A6 and S6 Sportback E-Tron models will be going on sale in the U.S. by the \"spring/summer of 2025,\" and pricing will need to wait until closer to launch.\n\nAudi S6 e-tron Avant View 18 Photos\n\nThey will unfortunately not be joined by the Avant versions unveiled simultaneously in Europe, Audi confirmed to us. You can see photos of the electric wagons in the gallery directly above. Just like the Sportback, Audi revealed the wagon in A6 and S6 versions, meaning there's both a tame and a spicier version that we won't be getting here. Practically everything is the same between the Sportback and Avant outside of body shape, and as expected, the wagon is less aerodynamic and suffers slightly in total range as a result.\n\nMore Information All Audi Models For Sale Rebates & Incentives News & Reviews Photos & Videos More Audi Information Featured Gallery 2025 Audi A6 Sportback E-Tron View 40 Photos Green Audi Technology Hatchback Electric Luxury Performance Sedan", "source": {"uri": "autoblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Autoblog"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zac_palmer@autoblog.com", "name": "Zac Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Harmonised_Light_Vehicles_Test_Procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi A6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_e-tron_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audi e-tron (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag coefficient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_&_Olufsen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bang & Olufsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://edgecast-img.yahoo.net/mysterio/api/A553DE0032184733E287CEBC644D7F0F3FCEA615DD1233E7A143F7F7659355D4/autoblog/resizefill_w1200_h675;quality_85;format_webp;cc_31536000;/https://s.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1200x675/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2024/07/30152534/A243225_large1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

This is the second model based on the brand's PPE (Premium Platform Electric) architecture and is closely related to the Q6 e-tron SUV that debuted in March this year. Co-developed with Porsche, the PPE platform will be used to underpin a host of VW Group cars in the coming years.\n\nIn line with Audi's new naming convention -- odd alphanumeric names for ICE cars and even for EVs -- the A6 e-tron can be thought of as an electric equivalent to the recently unveiled A5 sedan. The new A6 can be traced back to the A6 e-tron Sportback and Avant concepts from 2021 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, there's a high-performance S6 e-tron variant that will also be available in both Sportback and Avant body styles.\n\nIn typical Audi fashion, the design is understated, but a close look reveals some interesting details, especially with the lighting elements. It adopts the split headlamp design from the Q6 e-tron, but with slimmer upper LED DRLs to match the car's sleek profile. The LED signatures are even customizable, while the main headlamps below are Audi's familiar Matrix beams.\n\nApart from the lighting, what's cool is the gloss black fascia that contrasts well with the sealed-off, trapezoidal grille finished in body colour. The bumper also appears smoother than the Q6 e-tron that has sharper edges and is more angular. Meanwhile, the bonnet features two sharp character lines, extending from the LED DRLs to the A-pillars, adding some muscle to the overall look. The S6 variants are marked out by sportier inserts on the bumpers.\n\nAs for dimensions, the A6 e-tron measures 4,928mm in length, 1,923mm in width, 1,527mm in height and has a wheelbase of 2,946mm. There's a 27-litre frunk up front and 502-litre boot at the rear. As standard, both Sportback and Avant variants ride on 19-inch wheels, and can be upgraded up to 21-inch units.\n\nThe interior of the A6 e-tron is quite similar to the Q6 e-tron, carrying over the all-new electronic architecture that debuted on the latter. It features a single curved display that includes an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.5-inch central infotainment unit running on an Android-based operating system. Additionally, there is a separate 10.9-inch screen for the front passenger, designed to be out of the driver's view to avoid distractions. The A6 e-tron also comes with a HUD with augmented reality displays and the Audi assistant now gets AI support with voice commands, which, the company says evolves as per usage.\n\nA standout feature is the ambient lighting strip positioned at the base of the windscreen. It wraps around the entire dashboard and extends onto the doors, where the screens for the camera-based ORVMs are located -- another unique aspect of the A6 e-tron compared to the Q6 e-tron. The lighting strip not only changes colour to suit your preferences but also serves as a charging indicator, turn signal, and displays welcome and goodbye animations.\n\nThe new squarish steering wheel replaces the buttons with touch surfaces. There's also a new touch-based control panel on the driver's door pad that houses mirror, seat, and light controls. The control panel has indents to guide your fingers around but buttons would have just been better. Meanwhile, the center console features a new toggle switch for the drive selector, though some might miss Audi's traditional gear lever with an integrated palm rest. While the center console retains a physical rotary dial for media controls, the HVAC settings are fully integrated into the touchscreen.\n\nA notable update in the A6 e-tron is its entirely leather-free interior. The dashboard has a mix of fabric, satin silver, and gloss black finishes with contrast double stitching, while the seats are wrapped in fabric upholstery. Other key features include a premium 20-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system, a full ADAS suite, a powered tailgate, a 360-degree camera, and a panoramic glass roof that can switch between transparent and opaque at the touch of a button.\n\nBoth Sportback and Avant models will initially be offered in three variants: a base RWD one with 210 kW of power, a Performance RWD variant with 270 kW, and a top-spec Quattro AWD with 315 kW. The S6 e-tron models are positioned higher, featuring Quattro AWD and delivering 370 kW of power (405 kW with launch control).\n\nThe front axle of the AWD variants features an asynchronous electric motor that produces 140kW and 275Nm of torque. The rear axle is equipped with a permanent magnet synchronous motor that delivers 280kW and 580Nm of torque. Audi claims a 0-100kph sprint time of 6.0 seconds for the base RWD variant, 4.5 seconds for the Quattro AWD variant, and 3.9 seconds for the S6 e-tron models. The top speed is limited to 210 kph for the regular A6 e-tron, while the S6 e-tron reaches up to 240 kph.\n\nRegarding the battery pack, two options will be available: the base RWD variant uses an 83kWh battery with a WLTP-claimed range of 610km, while the rest of the range gets a larger 100kWh battery, offering a range of 670km to 750km, depending on the variant. With up to 270kW at 800 volts, the 100kWh battery can go from 10 to 80 percent in 21 minutes. Audi claims a range of 310km can be topped up in just 10 minutes. Onboard AC charging speed is only 11kW, but an option of 22kW will also be offered. Uniquely, the A6 e-tron includes charging ports on both sides for added convenience, and adaptive air suspension will be offered as an optional extra.\n\nThe A6 e-tron will go on sale in international markets in early 2025, starting with Europe, its home market. A launch in India is anticipated by mid-2025. Audi has indicated a starting price of \u20ac85,000 (approximately Rs 77 lakh, before taxes) for the A6 e-tron, while the S6 e-tron is expected to be priced from \u20ac1,00,000 (approximately Rs 91 lakh, before taxes). Upon launch, it will find competition from the BMW i5 in India.\n\nAlso See:", "source": {"uri": "autocarindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Autocar India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saptarshi_mondal@autocarindia.com", "name": "Saptarshi Mondal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_e-tron_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi e-tron (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bumper (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_running_lamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daytime running lamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_body_style", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car body style"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hood (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trunk (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trapezoid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_console_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center console (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_&_Olufsen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bang & Olufsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fitness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdni.autocarindia.com/ExtraImages/20240731042255_8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The automaker's last vehicle launch with a gas or diesel engine will take place as soon as 2026.\n\nThe U.S. will only receive the Sportback, sales of which are due to start here next spring or summer. Audi hasn't confirmed whether the A6 E-Tron will arrive as a 2025 or 2026 model. The automaker also hasn't revealed pricing information.\n\nThe A6 E-Tron is the second vehicle from Audi to ride on Volkswagen Group's PPE (Premium Platform Electric) dedicated EV platform which debuted earlier this year in the Audi Q6 E-Tron and Porsche Macan EV siblings. The 800-volt platform enables DC charging at rates of up to 270 kw, and at this rate Audi said a charge of the A6 E-Tron's standard 100-kwh battery from 10-80% can take as little as 21 minutes.\n\nConcept car good looks\n\nThe A6 E-Tron was previewed in 2021 by a concept of the same name, and the production version closely resemble the striking show car. There are split headlights up front, which flank a sealed-off grille and sit atop a blacked out front fascia that gives the car a wide-mouth look. At the rear, the Audi logo is illuminated and forms part of a LED light strip for the taillights.\n\nThe A6 E-Tron measures 194 inches long, or a few inches shorter than the Tesla Model S. It has a long 116-inch wheelbase though, which should result in a roomy cabin. Audi says there's plenty of space for four adults. Rear storage space is 26 cubic feet as standard or 40 cubic feet with the rear seats folded flat.\n\nThe interior design is the same as what Audi uses in the Q6 E-Tron, meaning a curved panel angled toward the driver and integrating an 11.9-inch digital gauge cluster and a 14.5-inch for the Android-based infotainment system.\n\nFor buyers who can't imagine an empty space not filled by a screen, Audi offers a 10.9-inch for use by the front passenger. This third screen can be used to control some vehicle functions as well as display video. A so-called digital blind means the driver won't be distracted. Additional controls are located on the driver's door and on the center console, and a head-up display with augmented reality can be added.\n\nIn the U.S., the A6 E-Tron will be offered with the choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. The S6 E-Tron will come exclusively with the latter.\n\nWith rear-wheel drive, a single motor delivering a maximum 362 hp will spin the rear axle, and Audi estimates a 0-60 mph time of 5.2 seconds. Upgrading to all-wheel drive will add a dual-motor setup rated at a maximum 422 hp, or enough for 0-60 mph acceleration in 4.3 seconds. Top speed will be limited to 130 mph for both configurations.\n\nThe S6 E-Tron will come with a dual-motor powertrain delivering 496 hp, extendable to 543 hp briefly when using launch control. With launch control activated, Audi estimates the S6 E-Tron will hustle to 60 mph from rest in 3.7 seconds. Top speed for this model is limited to 149 mph.\n\nThe S6 E-Tron isn't likely to be the end of the performance road for the A6 E-Tron family. Though it's yet to be confirmed, a high-performance RS 6 E-Tron model is thought to be in the works.\n\nNo EPA range estimate for any A6 E-Tron member has been provided, though the A6 E-Tron rates up to 466 miles on the more lenient WLTP cycle used overseas, meaning a range of well over 300 miles should still be possible using the EPA cycle.\n\nDue to current regulations, the U.S. will miss out on technologies like matrix LED headlights, car-to-X communication, and light signatures that can be customized. The U.S. will also miss out on the A6 E-Tron's camera-based side mirrors, Audi has confirmed.", "source": {"uri": "motorauthority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor Authority"}, "authors": [{"uri": "viknesh_vijayenthiran@motorauthority.com", "name": "Viknesh Vijayenthiran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Concept car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_Q6", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi Q6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Macan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche Macan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Direct current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grille (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascia_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fascia (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-car_entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In-car entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model S"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.hgmsites.net/hug/new-audi-a6-e-tron-sportback_100937751_h.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

We've got full pictures and skeleton specifications for the new Sportback and Avant estate models, as well as the high-performance S6.\n\nThe story, which appeared online in digital magazines this morning, says the new A6 e-tron will have \"up to 543bhp and more than 466 miles of range.\" As suspected, both the saloon and estate will use the firm's Premium Platform Electric (PPE) platform and 800-volt architecture, as seen on the recently-launched Q6 e-tron SUV.\n\nAccording to the leaked information, two powertrains will be offered. Base cars will be badged A6 e-tron Performance and get a single rear motor with 362bhp and 0-62mph in 5.4 seconds. Above this sits the flagship (for now) S6, with another motor on the front axle for a combined 496bhp and a 3.9-second 0-62mph time. The article suggests a launch control function can temporarily up this power figure to 543bhp for maximum straight line speed. Both cars will use a 94.9kWh (usable) battery and boast 270kW peak DC charging speeds.\n\nVisually, the cars stick very closely to the A6 e-tron concept from 2021. We can see the large grille-like panel will be colour-coded with the rest of the body, flanked by a set of slim daytime running lights that sit above narrow headlights similar to those found on the car's Q6 sibling. Looking at the leaked images, it appears the S6 variant will be marked out by satin silver trim on the bumper and window frames.\n\nTo the side, there's gloss black cladding with 'e-tron' lettering, while to the rear we can see a full-width light bar and what looks like a set of illuminated rings in place of the conventional Audi logo. As on the Q6, S line-badged A6 variants get a small red square on the bootlid to mark them out from lesser models in the range.\n\nInside, we can see the same curved infotainment panel found on other recent Audi's, as well as a smaller screen on the passenger side. There's a squared-off steering wheel and a high centre console; the cabin appears to be covered in a mixture of what looks like leather, fabrics and high-gloss black plastic.\n\nWe'll have all the official information, including predicted prices, charging times and more information about an extended model line-up, when the embargo lifts at midday today.", "source": {"uri": "autoexpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Auto Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_ingram@autoexpress.co.uk", "name": "Richard Ingram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_e-tron_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi e-tron (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi A6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_Q6", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Audi Q6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drivetrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drivetrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flagship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_(car)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bumper (car)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_console_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center console (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_vehicle_lighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency vehicle lighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_running_lamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daytime running lamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media.autoexpress.co.uk/image/private/s--X-WVjvBW--/f_auto,t_content-image-full-desktop@1/v1722413794/autoexpress/2024/07/Audi-A6-e-tron-leaked-front-3-4_edq6uj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The venerable company-car favourite has been given a new lease of life with a sleek, aero-optimised design and a range of zero-emission electric powertrains. The A6 e-tron Sportback and A6 e-tron Avant have been revealed in tandem, ahead of their UK launch towards the end of this year.\n\nHeadline stats include up to 750 kilometres (466 miles) of range, 270kW ultra-rapid charging, and a set of advanced digital light clusters with eight customisable designs. Rear and quattro four-wheel-drive models will be offered, as well as a near-500bhp S6 flagship capable of 0-62mph in 3.9 seconds.\n\nLike the petrol, diesel and plug-in hybrid A5 revealed earlier this month, the A6 ditches its old saloon-style body in favour of a slipperier sportback shape. Exterior designer Sascha Heyde told us the maker \"didn't want to do something different just because it's an EV\".\n\nThat means the boot is hinged from the roofline rather than at the base of the window, which should boost practicality for those wanting their executive car to occasionally double as a van.\n\nYet if that sounds like you, you'll almost certainly be better served by the new A6 Avant. Sharing its PPE (Premium Platform Electric) architecture with the Sportback, it prioritises practicality with a 502-litre boot - expandable to 1,422 litres with the rear seats folded down.

Audi wants a piece of the action with the new A6 Avant E-Tron, which spawns a high-performance S6 from day one. The latter goes up against the i5 M60 Touring, an M Performance version of Bavaria's luxury electric wagon.\n\nIn S6 guise, the performance estate from Ingolstadt delivers 496 horsepower to the Quattro all-wheel-drive system. Using launch control unlocks the full 543 hp, enabling a 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) run in 3.9 seconds. Audi quotes a top speed of 149 mph (240 km/h). That pair of electric motors draws its juice from a 94.9-kWh battery that Audi installs in the standard A6 Avant E-Tron as well.\n\nThe company with the Four Rings logo claims a fully charged battery lasts for over 398 miles (640 kilometers) of range. Should you be in a hurry to replenish the battery, the electric A6/S6 Avant E-Tron supports 270-kW DC charging as standard. It'll take 21 minutes to go from 10% to 80%. If you can't wait this long, 10 minutes puts enough energy back into the battery for 193 miles (310 kilometers). That's provided you have access to a station that supports the full charging power.\n\nThe Avant joins an equally stylish Sportback, a five-door liftback that goes up against the BMW i5 sedan. These new Audi EVs come with a controversial split headlight design and a triple-screen setup inside. While the Sportback has a drag coefficient of just 0.21 - a record for an Audi production car - the Avant is rated at 0.24. These figures were achieved after installing side cameras and aero-tweaked wheels.\n\nOf the two body styles, only the Sportback is coming to the United States. However, those side mirrors we mentioned won't be legal here, nor will the adaptive matrix LED headlights installed on the European model. Audi will begin to accept orders in Germany in September, with the US to follow at a later date.\n\nIn its home market Deutschland, the S6 Avant E-Tron costs \u20ac101,150 whereas the regular A6 electric wagon begins at \u20ac77,250.", "source": {"uri": "bmwblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BMW BLOG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "horatiu_boeriu@bmwblog.com", "name": "Horatiu Boeriu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_S6", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi S6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingolstadt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ingolstadt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ingolstadt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_body_style", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car body style"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liftback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liftback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag coefficient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Audi-S6-Avant-E-Tron-11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778471", "eventUri": "eng-9778471", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Audi played it safe by making the E-Tron as much like the combustion Q8 as possible, and Audi did it so well that it earned Green Car Reports Best Car To Buy 2020.\n\nSo much has changed in five years, including a new 2024 Q8 E-Tron. While the Q8 showcases how much can change for a single electric model, the A6 and related Q6 show how much more is possible on a dedicated platform used not just on several model lines but across VW AG's many brands.\n\nThe flexible PPE and its 800-volt electric architecture will be used on at least 10 electric models launched globally in the next few years.\n\n\"The future will be an all-electric portfolio,\" Audi CEO Gernot D\u00f6llner confirmed in a press briefing in Munich. \"We have a lot of debate in Europe about the speed of that. We'll be flexible for the next 10 years.\"\n\nBy 2027, Audi plans to have a battery electric offering in every core segment, and in two years time the brand will have a new combustion portfolio. Audi still forecasts a fully electric lineup by 2033, even as automakers ranging from Cadillac to Mercedes-Benz and even its Porsche family member walk back those all-electric targets. The A6 and S6 hatchbacks will rival existing models ranging from the Mercedes-Benz EQE, BMW i5, and Tesla Model S.\n\nIn the meantime, the new A6 E-Tron illustrates Audi's new naming convention, where even-numbered models are electric and odd-numbered models are combustion vehicles, also on a new Premium Platform Combustion heralded by the 2025 Audi A5.\n\n\"We will need these vehicles to bridge to the all-electric future,\" D\u00f6llner iterated.\n\nFor the time being, Audi holds fast to the balky E-Tron naming convention for EVs.\n\nThe 2025 A6 E-Tron spearheads Audi's mainstream electric sedans, excepting the $130,000 E-Tron GT that's also refreshed for 2025. The electric A6 embodies the understated poise that has defined Audi design for decades.\n\nThe hood cascades down between slim daytime running lights bejeweled with a three-dimensional design. Customizable light signatures crown a solid grille studded with faux levers as part of Audi's \"inverted grille\" design, where the lower grille is open except for the radar housings. Plastic corners with recessed intakes hold up the LED headlights in a raccoon mask of black. A splitter lips the bottom. The grille optimizes airflow while minimizing drag, Audi tells us, and helps make the A6 Sportback E-Tron the most aerodynamic vehicle in the VW Group family with a 0.21 coefficient of drag.\n\nYou may notice the welcome light show more. With the optional light package, the four-ring logo illuminates in red at the tail and white on the nose. Brush your hand on the hood above the rings up front and it pops the frunk, which is large enough to fit a stuffed backpack or the cable for the 9.6-kw onboard charger. In the rear, a light arrow appears on the ground to wave your foot and pop the hatch with no hands.\n\nWalk up to the car and it illuminates like a good pup sitting and waiting, its tail wagging, instead of other automakers' light shows that can be too much, like a pup jumping all over you. In the back, ten OLED panels and a light bar span the raised hatch and integrated spoiler. It too has eight customizable light signatures, like the front, and in some markets the taillights can flash a hazard triangle to reflect danger up ahead or it can generate other images in concert with whatever the algorithms are picking up from the five onboard computers supporting Audi's digital architecture.\n\nThere's a lot promised, and features such as car-to-X communications and the adaptive matrix LED headlights won't be available for North America for now, but this evolution of using the taillights to communicate to other drivers could be far more significant than the third brake light mandated in the U.S. in 1986.\n\nGetting other automakers and cars to speak the same language is a separate hurdle.\n\nEven the customizable light signatures are subject to different U.S. regulations; they can only be changed when you're parked. Blame U.S. regulators for the chunky side mirrors instead of the slim side-mirror cameras available in other markets; that ups the coefficiency of drag from 0.21 to 0.22 in North America.\n\nAnother non-American thing? The gorgeous Avant wagon model, muscular in all the right places yet toned on the ends, won't come to North America.\n\nIn profile short overhangs and slim wheel gaps house 19-inch wheels standard on the A6, 20-inchers standard on the S6, or optional 21-inch wheels. The curved roofline and raised haunches lend it the sophistication of a grand tourer but with a prominent Sportback rear. A black E-Tron blade breaks up the rocker panels and signals the thick, nearly 6-inch floor housing the 100-kwh battery pack (94.9 usable).\n\nUnderneath its toned Sportback skin, the A6 E-Tron gets most of the same mechanicals as the Q6 E-Tron SUV that marked Audi's first big evolutionary EV lift.\n\nWhen it goes on sale here next spring or summer as a 2025 model (we're confident it will be changed to a 2026 model) it will be offered in three variants bulleted above.\n\nThe low-set battery pack consists of 12 modules of 15 prismatic cells made of more energy-dense nickel-cobalt-manganese lithium-ion cells. The A6 E-Tron uses a 280-kw permanent magnet synchronous motor in back as the main propulsion unit, while a 140-kw induction motor on the front axle helps with takeoff and supplements heavy power demands. The front motor spins freely, when cruising for greater efficiency.\n\nNew motor designs weigh less and require about 30% less installation space than the motors used in the Q4 and Q8, with more efficiency and about half of the friction losses versus Audi's last-gen motors. Curb weight, range estimates, torque, and other specs were not finalized for the A6.\n\nAudi fits the S6 with an air suspension with adaptive dampers. Audi says the front and rear tires will be sized differently, wider in the rear, with the demo S6 cars wearing Michelin Pilot Sports 245/40R21s up front and 275/35R21s in back. We don't know if that will carry over to the U.S.\n\nAudi says that 95% of everyday braking in the A6 E-Tron can be handled by both motors, and it can recuperate up to 220 kw. The Q6 can capture up to 0.25 g of deceleration, but Audi didn't have that spec finalized for the A6. Paddle shifters can adjust the regen levels, from coasting to grabby, or the \"B\" mode in the console gear selector enables one-pedal driving. An Auto mode modulates regen braking from the camera system reading the road and traffic ahead.\n\nAudi did not want to talk range, especially for the U.S., but in European spec it targeted a range of 750 kilometers, or 466 miles on the very generous WLTP cycle. Maybe the A6 E-Tron RWD will reach 375 miles on the EPA cycle?\n\nOwners can use Plug & Charge at Electrify America stations that automatically connect to your account, so you don't need to swipe a card. Even at an EA station rated at 135 kw, the 800-volt charging system virtually splits into twin 400-volt circuits that can charge in parallel in 35 minutes. At home, on a 50-amp 240-volt AC circuit, the A6 E-Tron's 9.6-kw onboard charger will fill the battery in about 10 hours.\n\nThe new A6 E-Tron is about the same length as the outgoing gas model but it's at least an inch taller and wider, and I could fit easily in the rear seats, with a fist-full of headroom for my 5-foot-8 stature.\n\nA panoramic sunroof with six grades of opacity opens up the space, and the demo cars showcased Audi's finest quilted leather.\n\nThe A6 E-Tron embraces the brand's \"Digital Stage\" rolling out in new models on these new platforms, including the Q6 E-Tron and the new Audi A5 sedan. The curved panoramic display starts with the crystal clear 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster that shows vehicle info and whatever the exterior sensors are picking up. It holds a small message board of colored dots and dashes that reflect what the voice assistant is processing. The same system in the Q6 had good fidelity and, aided by AI, it can process more than 800 vehicle commands and general interest questions.\n\nThe voice commands lessen the need for the 14.5-inch touchscreen interface that evolves Audi's already excellent graphics. Users can easily press and drag apps to their desired position, rearrange info hierarchies, and customize tile displays. Beside it is a 10.9-inch passenger touchscreen for private streaming or to help navigate; the passenger can override the nav settings from their screen. One cool available feature will be a 20-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system that includes headrest speakers creating two sound zones -- one for the driver to listen to nav directions, for instance, without disrupting the passenger's Netflix and chill.\n\nPricing and full U.S. specs won't be released until closer to late spring, but in Germany the A6 Sportback E-Tron Quattro will cost 75,600 euros, or about $82,000, and the S6 slots at 99,500 euros, or about $108,000.

In turn, the outgoing petrol and diesel A6 will adopt the A7 moniker - previously reserved for Audi's luxury four-door coup\u00e9 - for a new generation that will arrive next year.\n\nVisually, the new A6 E-tron remains faithful to the concept of the same name that was shown three years ago. The addition of equipment required for production - larger air intakes, full-size headlights and ADAS sensors - has made for a lightly restyled front end, but the sleek, muscular proportions remain intact.\n\nThe saloon follows its high-riding stablemate, the Q6 E-tron, onto the new Premium Platform Electric (PPE) architecture, offering 800V electrics as well as a broad range of battery packs and powertrains.\n\nThe headline performance statistic is the range-topping Sportback's claimed range of more than 466 miles, which eclipses the official figures for the equivalent i5 (356 miles) and EQE (429 miles). The estate-bodied A6 E-tron Avant concedes 19 miles of range, owing to its less aerodynamic shape, pegging it at a claimed 447 miles.\n\nA key component in achieving those figures is a new and more efficient 94.9kWh (usable capacity) battery, which has been designed specifically for the PPE platform and comprises 12 modules and 180 cells. Audi has also confirmed that a 10-module 79kWh unit will become available shortly after the new A6's launch.\n\nBoth batteries use a new lithium ion nickel-manganesecobalt make-up that is said to enable a 30% improvement in cell density over with the packs in the Q8 E-tron and E-tron GT.\n\nThe A6 can be recharged at 11kW on a domestic AC supply through either of its charging ports - mounted on each of the car's rear haunches - but the driver's side port can also take DC at rates of up to 270kW.

Things have been tense among the Knight family for the past few weeks, ever since Elaine Peacock (Harriet Thorpe) learnt that fianc\u00e9 George Knight (Colin Salmon) had kissed ex-wife Cindy Beale (Michelle Beale). George was in a bad place when the kiss happened, having just lost mum Gloria and seen Eddie sent to prison for the murder of his biological father.

However, the mood is spoiled when Cindy arrives, and the girls make it known that they\u2019re not happy with her being there. Junior tries to rebuild the family (Picture: BBC/Jack Barnes/Kieron McCarron) Cindy soon takes the hint and heads to the Queen Vic instead, where Elaine later catches her helping George behind the bar.

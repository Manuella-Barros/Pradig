In the last 48 hours, ever since Sheikh Hasina resigned from the post of Prime Minister of Bangladesh and fled to India, protests have flared up across Bangladesh, taking on communal colour too.\n\nSince Tuesday, several Hindu temples have been vandalised, Hindu shops attacked, and houses of prominent Hindu personalities living in Bangladesh burnt down. With the toppling of the Awami League government, the country has come under the control of Bangladesh Army, which has so far been unable to control the raging mobs.\n\nThe mobs have not spared low-ranking officials of the Awami League government either. As many as 29 bodies of Awami League leaders and their family members have been discovered in a dismembered state across various cities.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bangladesh's former foreign minister Hasan Mahmud, a close confidant of Hasina for several decades, was detained at the Dhaka airport and handed over to the Army. He was also trying to come to India.\n\nAround 19,000 Indian nationals are currently present in Bangladesh, out of which about 9,000 are students.\n\nALSO READ | Bangladesh Crisis: Aug 1975 Redux For Sheikh Hasina -- Ex-PM Likely To Stay In India As Clamour Grows For Arrest\n\nOn Tuesday, in an address to both houses of Parliament, External Affairs Minister S.

The mission's helplines are also functional and the numbers are +8801958383679, +8801958383680 and +8801937400591.\n\nSince Hasina quit, Indian high commissioner Pranay Verma and other diplomats in Dhaka have been engaged in hectic efforts to engage with authorities in Bangladesh, especially the military, the people said. The Indian side has also conveyed to military authorities the need to protect Indian nationals and Bangladesh's minority communities, they said.\n\nDespite Bangladesh Army chief Gen Waker-uz-Zaman calling for peace and order in the wake of Hasina's resignation on Monday, violence - mostly directed against the Awami League party's leaders, workers and supporters - has continued in many parts of the country. However, a sense of normalcy has returned to Dhaka.\n\nA mob torched a hotel owned by an Awami League politician in Jashore, killing 24 people, while an Awami League activist was among three people beaten to death in Khulna. Film producer Selim Khan and his actor son Shanto Khan were killed in Chattogram as violence roiled several parts of Bangladesh on Tuesday.\n\nNearly 140 people died in violence after Hasina's resignation, taking the death toll since last month to almost 450.\n\nBesides the high commission in Dhaka, India has assistant high commissions in Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet. While informing Parliament on developments in Bangladesh on Tuesday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said India was deeply concerned about the status of the country's minorities following attacks on their businesses and places of worship.\n\nThough several groups have taken steps to protect minorities, India's concerns will remain till law and order is restored, he said. He called on Bangladeshi authorities to provide security for India's missions, which will resume normal functioning once the situation stabilises.\n\nThere were about 19,000 Indian nationals, including 9,000 students, in Bangladesh when the protests began last month. The bulk of the students have returned home in recent weeks.\n\nThe Hindu minority makes up about 8% of Bangladesh's population of almost 170 million.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waker-uz-Zaman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waker-uz-Zaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khulna", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khulna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khulna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajshahi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajshahi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajshahi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylhet", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sylhet"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sylhet"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/07/1600x900/An-aerial-view-shows-anti-government-protestors-st_1723014159119.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797093", "eventUri": "eng-9797093", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The unrest began with student groups protesting against reserved quotas in government jobs.\n\nThe violence was triggered by a high court order to reinstate a 30 percent job quota for descendants of freedom fighters.The protests escalated, leading to massive demonstrations and violent clashes across the country.\n\nThe escalating situation forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and seek asylum in India. Her resignation marked the end of her 15-year second stint in power and sparked celebrations nationwide. Crowds stormed her official residence unopposed after her departure, celebrating the end of her rule in the nation of 170 million, which has been grappling with economic distress in recent years.\n\nInterim government head appointed\n\nIn response to the crisis, Bangladesh's president appointed Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of the interim government. According to a statement from the president's office, there is an urgent need to finalize the remaining members of the interim government to navigate the country through the ongoing turmoil.\n\nContinued violence and casualties\n\nDespite the political changes, violence continues to plague the country. The bodies of at least 29 supporters of Hasina's Awami League party were recovered across Bangladesh through Tuesday, raising the overall death toll to 469 in almost three weeks since the protests began in July. Media reports have highlighted increasing cases of violence against minorities, including the vandalism and destruction at the residence of Rahul Ananda, the frontman of the popular folk band Joler Gaan. Ananda and his family have since taken shelter in a secret location.\n\nIndian High Commission issues helpline numbers\n\nAmid the political unrest, the Indian High Commission in Bangladesh remains operational and has released helpline numbers for Indian nationals residing in the country. The diplomats and officials of the High Commission continue to stay in Bangladesh, while non-essential staff and their families were evacuated on Wednesday morning. The helpline numbers are: +8801958383679, +8801958383680, and +8801937400591.\n\nSpecial evacuation flights by Indian airlines\n\nIn response to the volatile situation in Dhaka, Air India and IndiGo have operated special flights to evacuate Indian nationals. A special Air India flight brought 205 people, including six infants, from Dhaka to New Delhi on Wednesday morning. IndiGo also operated a special flight from Dhaka to Kolkata on Tuesday, successfully bringing back Indian nationals from Bangladesh.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

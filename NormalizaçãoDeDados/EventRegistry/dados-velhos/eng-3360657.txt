With Jackson now out of office, however, the Knicks have seemingly rescinded the interest in trading Porzingis-or so it seems.\n\nBottom line, Irving is good, but the Knicks could build a contender around Porzingis if they handle it right.\n\nIt is possible that the Cavs are a little disappointed over Irving's decision which makes the trade a little slow to process considering the kind of player they want in exchange.\n\nIt could take a lot to make the Knicks budge, however.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305866", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321505", "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "322747", "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "489035", "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

It all started with the Cavaliers' general manager David Griffin, as he and the Cavaliers parted ways earlier this summer. This left the Cavs without a general manager and the situation reached boiling point when #Kyrie Irving requested to be traded. He went to the Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, and reportedly told him that he doesn't want to play alongside LeBron James anymore. Irving stated that he wants to be on a new team, where he could be the vocal point and \"the man\".\n\nThe New York Knicks have been mentioned as one of Kyrie's preferred destinations if he gets traded [VIDEO], but no official deal has been made yet. It seems like the Knicks [VIDEO]don't have much to offer to the Cavaliers, but the Cavs would be ready to make this deal if one player is included.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reported earlier this week that the primary Cavaliers' target, in a potential trade deal with the New York Knicks, is #Kristaps Porzingis. The Knicks would obviously welcome Kyrie Irving as he is considered one of the best point guards in today's NBA. But in order to get Irving, the Knicks would have to send Kristaps Porzingis to Cleveland because Porzingis is the Cavs' primary target. Wojnarowski also reported that the Cavs would have to take on the three seasons and $55 million remaining on the contract of Joakim Noah in order to begin negotiations for Porzingis.\n\nGetting Porzingis in exchange for Irving makes sense for the Cavaliers, as Porzingis showed last season he's an All-Star caliber player. Porzingis just turned 22 this summer, and he would give the Cavaliers a young star who could also help them immediately with his skills. He averaged 18.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game last season while shooting 45% from the field. The 7-foot-3 Porzingis made 35% of his three-pointers last season with the Knicks, and playing alongside LeBron James would make him even better.\n\nIt is hard to believe that the Knicks would be ready to trade Kristaps Porzingis, even if it would mean getting Kyrie Irving in return. While Irving is one of the best ball handlers the NBA has ever seen and an explosive one-on-one player, Porzingis is three years younger and has a special skill set. At 7-foot-3 Porzingis can defend the rim at a pretty decent rate, and his ball handling has also improved over the past two seasons. He averaged 2.0 blocks last season and in addition to his defensive abilities, he was able to spread the floor for the Knicks with his three-point shooting. If Carmelo Anthony gets traded from the Knicks this summer [VIDEO], we should expect Porzingis to have an even bigger role in New York next season.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 100, "id": 523, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307687", "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

As the storied franchise continues its hunt for a potential trade partner, the Cavs is moving on from Irving and move forward under the conjecture LeBron James won't re-sign with the organization following the 2017-18 National Basketball Association regular season, thus the need for a young core and emerging talented star like Porzingis.\n\nThe Cavaliers reportedly had Porzingis at the top of their list when it came to trade targets for Irving. \"In all the discussions since then - there were other rumors before that Cleveland would want Kristaps - and it didn't seem that [the Knicks] were interested at all in a conversation\". He is owed more than $55 million over the next three season after signing a four-year contract, $72 million deal with the Knicks in the offseason last year.\n\nKristaps Porzingis #6 of the New York Knicks reacts against the Brooklyn Nets during the second half at Madison Square Garden on November 9, 2016 in New York City. He can get more buckets. By locking up so much salary in the big man, they would essentially guarantee that LeBron James would be leaving and there would be little left to rebuild a team around Porzingis.\n\nUnbelievably, the Knicks could actually roll out a lineup next season that does not include Porzingis but does include Carmelo Anthony. KP scored 18.1 points and grabbed 7.2 rebounds a game last season, shot 35.7 percent from three, and while still learning he brings more defense than Irving. He has the work ethic, he's shown flashes, they just need to give him a real chance.\n\nBottom line, Irving is good, but the Knicks could build a contender around Porzingis if they handle it right. New Knicks GM Scott Perry would surely want to see if there's anything to an Irving - Anthony combo before moving the small forward.\n\nIt could take a lot to make the Knicks budge, however.

USA TODAY Sports / Ken Blaze\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs and Kyrie Irving have mutual interest in a long-term commitment, according to a new report. Irving had listed the Spurs as one of his preferred destinations after requesting a trade out of Cleveland.\n\nThe Spurs could potentially put together a package of LaMarcus Aldridge, Tony Parker and Danny Green that would allow the Cavaliers to remain a championship contender. However, the new Cavs front office, led by general manager Koby Altman, is focused on acquiring a young star as part of their trade package for Irving. With LeBron James likely to leave his hometown franchise in next year's free agency period, the Cavs are determined to acquire a haul of players that will be Cleveland-bound for the long haul.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Spurs would emerge as a potential trade partner only if the Cavs get a long-term commitment from James.\n\n\"If the Cavaliers knew they had James committed, for example, San Antonio could emerge as a more intriguing trade partner. The Spurs have interest in Irving, league sources say, and Irving's willingness to commit to an extension with the Spurs makes for legitimate win-now deal possibilities for Cleveland. Without James beyond next season, though, the likes of LaMarcus Aldridge, Tony Parkerand Danny Green hold no appeal,\" Wojnarowski wrote in his report Tuesday.\n\nKyrie Irving Trade: Cavs want a young star in return\n\nThe report added that the Cavs are seeking a blue-chip young prospect to headline the Kyrie Irving trade. They have targeted players such as Kristaps Porzingis (New York Knicks), Jayson Tatum (Boston Celtics), Josh Jackson (Phoenix Suns) or Jamal Murray (Denver Nuggets) -- but are open to the idea of taking back veteran contracts to facilitate the trade.\n\nIt's important to note that the Cleveland Cavaliers are not obligated to grant Irving's request since the All-Star point guard is under contract for a minimum of two more seasons. Irving signed a five-year maximum level contract worth US$94 million (AU$118 million) with the Cavs ahead of the 2014-15 season.\n\nSince then, Irving has made several All-Star games and All-NBA teams besides helping Cleveland capture a franchise-first NBA championship in 2016. Irving also made the shot heard around the world during Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors.\n\nKyrie Irving, drafted No. 1 overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2011, averaged 25.2 points, and 5.8 assists and 3.2 rebounds in his sixth season in the league. While he is expected to be traded ahead of next month's training camp, there are rumblings of Irving potentially staying in Cleveland for another year.

Kristaps Porzingis skipped his exit meeting. Jackson drafted international prospect Frank Ntilikina -- a great fit for his coveted triangle offense -- over Summer League stud Dennis Smith Jr. Jackson was fired six days after the NBA Draft. The team entered free agency without replacing Jackson. Before finding Jackson's replacement, the Knicks signed Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71M contract, which was widely viewed as a major overpay. The team hired Scott Perry as GM, and promoted Steve Mills to team president. Fringe NBA player Ron Baker was given a two-year contract, with a player option for the second year, AND technically has a no-trade clause because of the contract structure.\n\nIt might get even more hectic in the immediate future.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Tuesday morning that the Cleveland Cavaliers hope to receive a young potential building block if they do trade Kyrie Irving. Among those young building blocks is Porzingis.\n\nWhile this wouldn't be the Anthony-for-Irving swap Knicks fans hoped for when the Cavs' guard listed the Knicks as one of his preferred destinations, this could be a great opportunity for the Knicks to bring in an All-Star-level player with meaningful experience who is just 25 years old.\n\nDespite Porzingis' remarks about wanting to play his entire career in New York just a few weeks ago, Woj's report also stated that there's still a rift between the 22-year-old Latvian sensation and the organization that drafted him two years ago.\n\nIf the Knicks ship Porzingis, is Irving an optimal return? Ultimately, this comes down to whether or not the Knicks should part with Porzingis.\n\nWoj mentioned that the only way a Porzingis-for-Irving swap could happen would be if Joakim Noah was included. This would enable the Knicks to create cap space to build around Irving, while also dumping their most crippling contract.\n\nHowever, as good as Irving is, it's counterproductive to acquire him if Porzingis isn't on the roster. There simply wouldn't be another go-to player on the team, and it's a lateral move at best to build around Irving instead of Porzingis.\n\nAn argument could be made for either player being better to build around. The Knicks haven't had a franchise point guard in decades; Irving certainly fits that description. In Porzingis, the team already has a rim-protecting big man with the ability to stretch defenses and incredible perimeter skills for a player his size.\n\nIf it's a toss-up, trading the younger player on the better contract doesn't seem prudent.\n\nAfter two years the Knicks still haven't attempted to build a team, or an offense, around the 7-foot-3 Porzingis. To say he hasn't scratched the surface of his potential also rings true. If the Knicks were a piece or two away from being contenders, sure, a sniper like Irving is a game-changer.\n\nHowever, with a Melo trade rumored to be around the corner, now's the time to unleash Porzingis. Much of his frustration stemmed from playing with ball hogs in an antiquated system; both of those elements are history. Now's the time to build around the uniquely gifted Porzingis, and plenty of the pieces are already in place.\n\nAs unknown a quantity as Ntilikina is, a core of him, Porzingis and Willy Hernangomez is a legitimate youth movement. Add the potential that Baker and second-round pick Damyean Dotson have as developmental projects, and it reinforces said movement. Signing 25-year-old Hardaway didn't detract from that, and adding a facilitator like Ramon Sessions helps everyone.\n\nWith limited pressure to win games to appease Anthony, and all of the Knicks' draft picks in tow, Porzingis now has an environment conducive to growth.\n\nSure, Porzingis may not be okay with losing and a slow rebuild, but he has seen unsuccessful quick fixes first-hand. There's no guarantee that Perry and Mills can build around Porzingis, but the team has an unprecedented amount of flexibility.\n\nThe Knicks didn't do a great job bringing Porzingis along his first two years -- should they give up now? Bringing in a special talent like Irving isn't necessarily \"giving up\" on Porzingis, but he hardly accelerates the rebuild. As flawed as the roster is, this is the best fit for Porzingis to this point in his career.\n\nTrading Porzingis should be a last resort. If he wants out of New York badly, and the team can haul in Irving, it should. That doesn't appear to be the case right now, so this shouldn't be much of a discussion.\n\n7-footers who can legitimately hit 3s and block shots don't grow on trees. The Knicks have one of the most unique talents the league has ever seen, and they'd look silly if they traded him for anything less than an immediate shot at a championship.\n\nMore NBA Coverage Cavaliers in a delicate situation with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving Grading the Knicks offseason 2017-18 NBA Power Rankings | Offseason edition Related Items:FRS Feature, NBA East, NBA Today, New York Knicks FanRag Sports Daily NBA Newsletter", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324512", "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "344563", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Sessions", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "378435", "label": {"eng": "Ramon Sessions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "489035", "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway,_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "507264", "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway, Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_NBA_Summer_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1344849", "label": {"eng": "2015 NBA Summer League"}}]}

The Cavaliers appear focused on getting back a young star in return for Irving, the report said. \"In all the discussions since then - there were other rumors before that Cleveland would want Kristaps - and it didn't seem that [the Knicks] were interested at all in a conversation\". Noah will miss the first 12 games of the season as he finishes a 20-game suspension for using a banned substance. But with the whole league aware that Cleveland is trying to deal Irving, teams looking to deal for Irving begin negotiations with more leverage than the Cavaliers.\n\nNew York Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis has become the main prospect targer for the Cavaliers, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. The Cavs have reportedly been in talks with the San Antonio Spurs as well, and reports indicated that Irving would be willing to sign an extension if he were traded to the Western Conference contender.\n\nContracts, trade demands and egos often get in the way of player development and the ability for a losing team to turn things around. That's why the Cavaliers have been digging the league in hope to acquire promising players like Jackson, Porzingis, Boston Celtics Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum and Denver Nuggets second-year guard Jamal Murray, according to the report.\n\nPorzingis skipped his exit meeting with the Knicks at the end of the season, but Mills said last month that he and Porzingis had spoken a few times this summer. Irving, entering his seventh season, can do more to help a team win next season than Porzingis. Irving averaged 25.2 points per game last year with the Cavaliers - a team that has been to the NBA Finals three years in a row - and is a more proven commodity than Porzingis at this point. With Jackson now out of office, however, the Knicks have seemingly rescinded the interest in trading Porzingis-or so it seems.\n\n\"So far it's been tough in NY, but my journey is only beginning and I hope to stay there my whole career so as a city we can have some fun and win some games and do something big\", Porzingis said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 100, "id": 206, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307688", "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323680", "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "368316", "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

As it is well documented now, #Kyrie Irving requested a trade from the Cavaliers and the news shook up the NBA world. Irving was the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft but apparently he reached a point of his career where he feels like he's ready to move on. Reportedly Kyrie is tired of playing in LeBron James' shadow and wants a fresh start on a new team.\n\nIt was also reported that Irving wants to be the focal point on his new team, and he named the #San Antonio Spurs as one of his preferred landing spots if he gets traded [VIDEO].\n\nEven though he has two more years on his current contract with the Cavaliers and the Cavs don't have to trade him yet, his value will not be the same next season. Since Kyrie's regarded as one of the best point guards in the league, it's obvious that the Cavaliers want to get good players in return. According to the most recent reports, the Cavaliers would like to get an \"elite, young player\" in return for Kyrie Irving [VIDEO] as LeBron James' future in Cleveland is uncertain.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Kyrie Irving would like to play for the San Antonio Spurs and he would be ready to commit to a long-term deal with the Spurs. This is good news for the Spurs, as there were reports earlier that the All-Star point-guard wouldn't be prepared to sign a long-term contract extension with his potential new team.\n\nApparently, Kyrie changed his mind and he sees the Spurs as the perfect fit for him as he would like to play under the tutelage of Gregg Popovich for the rest of his career.\n\nThe Spurs would obviously want to have Kyrie Irving, and the combination of him and Kawhi Leonard would be great to see. The Spurs had the second best record last season in the NBA, finishing at the second spot in the Western Conference standings with a 61-21 record. Adding Kyrie Irving to their roster would improve their chances dramatically next season, but in order to get him they would have to send some good players back to Cleveland.\n\nGetting Kyrie Irving will not be simple at all for the San Antonio Spurs, and in order to acquire him they will most likely have to send multiple players back to Cleveland. It is believed that the combination of LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green and Tony Parker in exchange for Irving would be interesting for the Cavaliers. This would give the Cavaliers the opportunity to compete for the championship again next season, even without Kyrie Irving.\n\nAldridge is still one of the better low-post scorers in the NBA, even though he didn't play his best basketball last season. He averaged 17.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game last season with the Spurs. Danny Green averaged 7.3 points per game and shot 38 percent from the three-point line last season. He is one of the best defenders in the league at the shooting guard position.\n\nTony Parker would bring the necessary experience and championship pedigree to the Cavaliers, and the Cavs would benefit from having him on the roster as well. This trade deal would surely change the landscape of the NBA for many years to come, but it remains to be seen whether or not it happens.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_overall_NBA_draft_picks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304116", "label": {"eng": "List of first overall NBA draft picks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "316231", "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "321505", "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323677", "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329078", "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "345909", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "385981", "label": {"eng": "2011 NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "503756", "label": {"eng": "Danny Green (basketball)"}}]}

Getty Images\n\nThe Knicks do not have the assets acquired to land Kyrie Irving in a trade with the Cavs, unless they stun the NBA world and give up Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nIt was thought that the Porzingis trade rumors were ready to die once Phil Jackson left Manhattan, but when a player of Irving's caliber becomes available - any and every player is on the table.\n\nMoving Porzingis for Irving actually would make sense for the Knicks - especially if Cleveland can take on the disastrous Joakim Noah contract (easier said than done). The bottom line is that Irving is a better player than Porzingis. Irving is already a top 10 player in the league and has the potential to be a top three player. Porzingis is maybe a top 20 player and has the potential to be a top 10 player.\n\nThe age factor is virtually non-existent as Irving is 25 and Porzingis is 22. By all indications, Irving wants to play in New York as well - a rarity among top-flight NBA players under the James Dolan ownership. Even if Cleveland scoffs at taking on the Noah contract, an Irving for Porzingis straight-up swap makes a boatload of sense for both teams.\n\nRegarding the Knicks' sticking point on unloading the Noah contract, here's what ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski wrote about the situation this week:\n\n\"For the right All-Star player - Irving or otherwise - multiple NBA teams are seriously questioning how emphatic of a 'no' that will stay for New York,\" Wojnarowski wrote. \"There continues to be a distance between Porzingis and the organization, and how the Knicks truly value Porzingis' future could become clearer once they're together to begin the season.\"\n\nUnbelievably, the Knicks could actually roll out a lineup next season that does not include Porzingis but does include Carmelo Anthony. New Knicks GM Scott Perry would surely want to see if there's anything to an Irving - Anthony combo before moving the small forward.\n\nLongterm, Irving has enough cache to lure other young talented players to New York.

But whether Noah is included in a deal or not, there's simply no scenario where trading away the one glimmer of hope in the organization -- Porzingis -- does any good.\n\nThe original thinking in the Knicks looking to acquire Irving was simple -- to pair him with Porzingis, not to trade one for the other.\n\nBy potentially dealing Porzingis for Irving straight-up (which is not under consideration at the moment) the Knicks would be striping themselves of the one thing they've essentially gotten right.\n\nGrowing into a two-way force with his unique offensive play for a big man and well-rounded defensive arsenal, Porzingis has produced at a high enough level to the point where management could consider going forth with him being their franchise piece. But of course, in New York, no one is safe.\n\nAfter being shopped around by former president Phil Jackson before the NBA Draft, Porzingis was nearly a goner. But after his firing, the Porzingis trade talks began to cool off. Now they are back -- and potentially more catastrophic than ever.\n\nWith the Cavs looking to snatch the 7-foot-3 Latvian in exchange for Irving, will the Knicks ultimately cave in? The answer to that question could be answered with a counter: Will the Cavs become willing to take on the remaining $55 million remaining on Noah's deal?\n\nLast offseason, the Knicks signed Noah to a hefty four-year, $72 million pact -- a signing which didn't fare well in year one. Averaging five points per contest and undergoing a number of injuries, Noah endured a great deal of challenges in his first year with the Knicks. To make maters worse, he later lost his starting gig to rookie Willy Hernangomez. Based on their play last season, chances are Noah will assume a backup role in head coach Jeff Hornacek's rotation this upcoming year -- only worsening the signing.\n\nIf the Cavs decide that they'll take Noah's contract off the Knicks hands, then Scott Perry and Steve Mills will without a doubt think long and hard about pulling the trigger on a deal. But regardless of the potential for the Cavs to take Noah's cap number off the Knicks hands, it's not intriguing enough at the expense of Porzingis.\n\nIrving is one of the best scoring point guards of this decade and he'd instantly be the Knicks answer at point guard for the foreseeable future. But it's utterly pointless for the Knicks to deal away their 22-year-old budding star for him, even if it gets Noah out of town.\n\nBy swapping the young stars for one another, the Knicks get no better and only look foolish. After attempting to convince their fanbase that point guard Frank Ntilikina was the appropriate selection at number eight, what message would it send to trade the promising and ever improving Porzingis for a player who would take his minutes away?\n\nAnother aspect to take into account with any deal is how long the Knicks potentially have Porzingis under contract.\n\nWhile he will hit restricted free agency in two years, the Knicks own Porzings' rights. That means if he agrees to a deal with another team, the Knicks can match the offer sheet -- which essentially grants them his rights for the next 6-7 years.\n\nOn the other hand, they'd have Irving under contract for two years before he hits free agency in 2019.\n\nWhile Irving's desire to be dealt to the Knicks could very well lead him to pursue an extension or a restructured deal with them, it's no guarantee.\n\nIf management trades Porzingis for Irving and then the All-Star guard walks in free agency, it could go down as a legendary flop.\n\nThe idea of the Cavs taking back Noah sounds absurd, but it's not impossible. They haven't garnered the trade interest and packages for Irving they first envisioned. In reality, Porzingis is the best player they'd likely get back for him at this stage, which may persuade them to do the Knicks a favor -- that being taking on Noah's deal.\n\nBut whether the veteran center is included in a deal or not, there's simply no way the Knicks can trade away Porzingis. Plus, do the Knicks want to be infamously remembered for using their young star to eliminate a bad contract?", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100, "id": 153, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "344563", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hornacek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "374674", "label": {"eng": "Jeff Hornacek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "489035", "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

There are reportedly close to a dozen teams with some level of interest in Irving, and some of those talks have progressed beyond the initial feeling-out stages.\n\nNow, Sports Illustrated is reporting that the Cavs have been zeroing in on Porzingis and could potentially have a deal if they are willing to swallow Joakim Noah's contract in exchange.\n\nThere is at least one major problem right now -- the Knicks are holding tight to the talented 7-footer. A report from Newsday claimed that the Knicks currently had no interest in trading Porzingis, who would likely be the centerpiece of a rebuilding effort when the team finally trades Carmelo Anthony.\n\nAs Sports Illustrated noted, a straight Irving-for-Porzingis deal would make little sense for the Knicks. While Irving is a very talented guard, that is a commodity in large supply across the NBA. Porzingis, on the other hand, has a rare combination of size, ball-handling, shooting, and rim protection.\n\nTrading for Porzingis would also put the Cavaliers in a pinch, the report added. By locking up so much salary in the big man, they would essentially guarantee that LeBron James would be leaving and there would be little left to rebuild a team around Porzingis. Essentially, they would be going all-in on winning the title in the next season.\n\nIf the Cavaliers aren't able to find a package that would change the minds in the Knicks front office, there are other potential landing points for Kyrie Irving. The Cavs have reportedly been in talks with the San Antonio Spurs as well, and reports indicated that Irving would be willing to sign an extension if he were traded to the Western Conference contender.

But there's only one Porzingis in the NBA, or, more specifically, one 7-3 unicorn who won't be a RESTRICTED free agent for another two years. He's the prototypical big man for today's NBA, capable of stretching the floor and protecting the rim. You don't give up on a 22-year-old who represents the best player the Knicks have drafted since Patrick Ewing.\n\nKnicks ready to let Porzingis be featured player on offense\n\nInstead, you label that player untouchable. You fly to Europe and convince him that the Knicks are headed in the right direction after two incredibly dysfunctional seasons under Phil Jackson.\n\nIf, as ESPN reported Tuesday, the Cavaliers identified Porzingis as their primary target in a deal for Irving, the Knicks shouldn't use the opportunity to unload Carmelo Anthony or work Joakim Noah's albatross contract into the\n\nnegotiations. Trying to fix a mistake with a mistake is why Bill Clinton was impeached and George Clooney was once cast as Batman.\n\nSo just hang up. It's an easy way for the new front office to distance itself from Jackson, who publicly placed Porzingis on the trading block out of spite, mostly, while further alienating the Latvian.\n\nEx-Cavs GM Griffin: Irving will be gone, it took 'courage' to ask\n\nThere's a plan in place to build around Porzingis, and part of it involves the point guard the Knicks just drafted eighth overall in Frank Ntilikina. Giving up on that is akin to the shortsightedness that prompted the Knicks to trade for Derrick Rose, or sign Noah to the worst deal of 2016.\n\nGranted, Irving isn't Rose. He's a special offensive talent, a future Hall of Famer at the beginning of his prime. But let's be honest: acquiring Irving for Porzingis won't get the Knicks much closer to beating the Celtics in their own division, let alone the Cavs, Spurs, Rockets or Warriors.\n\nIf Irving really wants to play in New York, he can sign as a free agent in two years. Just make sure he does it early in the summer so the Knicks can also fit in Porzingis' max contract using his Bird Rights.\n\nThe Knicks should've exhibited such foresight before dealing for Carmelo Anthony over six years ago. But they panicked and gave up the house instead of waiting Anthony out for free agency. Those assets could've been used to land Chris Paul a few months later, but they instead embarked on a long and often directionless path that has led to this standoff with Anthony.\n\nPorzingis studying Conor McGregor to boost his trash-talk game\n\nThis time, the Knicks should actually follow a plan and hang up the phone.\n\nTags: kristaps porzingis cleveland cavaliers new york knicks nba nba transactions Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 100, "id": 520, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 916, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303239", "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304714", "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "329068", "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334399", "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342539", "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367654", "label": {"eng": "Derrick Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ewing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "403851", "label": {"eng": "Patrick Ewing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "489035", "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial_tone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "713630", "label": {"eng": "Dial tone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

A recent ESPN report claimed the Cavs are \"fixated\" on getting a young star in return for Irving, 25, and listed several targets, including Porzingis.\n\nIrving, who grew up in New Jersey, would love a New York homecoming and apparently is pressuring the Cavs to make it happen. But the Knicks are equally adamant about keeping Porzingis, whose 7-foot-3 size and athleticism make him a unique talent.\n\nSo despite the Cavs' desires, sources maintain that the Knicks have seen nothing \"out there that would get [them] to consider moving\" Porzingis.\n\nPorzingis, a huge fan favorite, became trade news in the waning days of the Phil Jackson regime when the former team president fielded offers. Somehow - probably through Jackson's firing -- Madison Square Garden was spared from fans' fiery wrath.\n\nPorzingis, who created dissension by skipping his exit interview at the end of the regular season, recently proclaimed his love of New York. Two weeks ago, he told the league's website - on his 22nd birthday while participating in Basketball without Borders program in Africa - that he is all-in on New York.\n\n\"I hope to stay there my whole career,\" Porzingis said. \"For me, it's now home.\"\n\nHey, maybe he'll even do an exit interview.\n\nThe lead players in Knicks new brain trust, president Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry, made it clear they want to develop and start a rebuild with youth. Porzingis is a perfect cornerstone. They have looked at an essential core four of Porzingis, Tim Hardaway Jr., draft pick Frank Ntilikina and center Willy Hernangomez. Sure, Irving is proven and young and would make a great addition. But not at the cost of Porzingis.\n\nAnd you thought Carmelo Anthony would supply the only offseason trade drama.\n\nSources maintain there has been little, if any, movement on the Anthony trade front. He wants Houston. He would waive his no-trade clause to go there - along with a 15 percent trade kicker that would cost him roughly $8 million to go to the Rockets. Cleveland is not nearly as attractive without Irving and with LeBron James' future there in question. Other teams, including Portland and Oklahoma City, have interest in Anthony, but the attraction has been one-way so far.\n\nThe Rockets have sought an extra trade partner to make the finances work because the Knicks have said no to taking back Ryan Anderson and his $60 million-over-three-years deal more times than the average person hangs up on robocalls.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100, "id": 153, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 270, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "type": "loc", "id": "216558"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308215", "label": {"eng": "Center (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308299", "label": {"eng": "Interview"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323684", "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "334399", "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "489035", "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway,_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "507264", "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway, Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

The Phoenix Suns rookie Josh Jackson was in the mix before, but now the Cavs may have its interests on a certain basketballer playing in in the Empire State City.\n\nNew York Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis has become the main prospect targer for the Cavaliers, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. As the storied franchise continues its hunt for a potential trade partner, the Cavs is moving on from Irving and move forward under the conjecture LeBron James won't re-sign with the organization following the 2017-18 NBA regular season, thus the need for a young core and emerging talented star like Porzingis.\n\nThat's not to conclude that the Cavaliers wouldn't be jump at the opportunity to re-ink James next offseason, but the Cavs franchise owner Dan Gilbert and new general manager Koby Altman comprehensively understand that they cannot be compassionate in this matter and risk another plummet in the depths just like the last time LeBron James left Cleveland to play in Miami Heat.

Irving, who is discontent with his situation with the Cleveland Cavaliers, would also welcome a move to the Spurs and be willing to extend his contract with them. The Spurs have apparently become one of the favorites to land Irving, but it will be a challenge for them to come up with a deal enticing enough for the Cavaliers.\n\nThe Spurs' offer could include the likes of LaMarcus Aldridge, #Tony Parker, or Danny Green in an offer for Irving [VIDEO]. However, it seems unlikely that the Cavaliers would accept such veterans.\n\nThe Cavs are looking for a young star they can build around, considering the possibility that James could also leave in free agency next year. And the Spurs' young talents like Dejounte Murray and Kyle Anderson are nothing close to what the Cavaliers are in pursuit of. The Spurs will likely look for a third team that can offer the Cavaliers the young star that would satisfy their needs.\n\nAs good as Kawhi Leonard is, Kyrie Irving would have a bigger role playing alongside him than playing alongside LeBron James [VIDEO]. Leonard, the quiet superstar, sets his ego aside in a Spurs fashion and does whatever is asked of him and whatever it takes to help his team win. Thus, Irving's game would still be able to stand out. Surely, he would need to buy into Gregg Popovich's system and tweak his individualistic style of play, but Tony Parker was a similar player in his earlier years and he was able to become more of a team player.\n\nThe Spurs are in need of an elite point guard once again if they want to truly contend for the NBA title. Tony Parker, 35, is on his last years in the league. In addition, he might still be out with the injury until next year. Irving would buy Leonard some rest and let him play in his natural position of small forward. In the last couple of years, Leonard has been asked to fill the role of the facilitator of the team, a point forward of sorts like LeBron James, but that is not Kawhi's forte. Irving could become the principal ball handler and allow Leonard to extend his offensive repertoire off the ball.\n\nThe Spurs, to many people's surprise, have not been very active this free agency. Their most notable moves include the signing of Rudy Gay, who is an offensive force but is coming off an Achilles tendon injury, and the re-signing of 37-year-old Pau Gasol for three more years. The Spurs might have bigger plans next year, which will have a loaded free agent class. But maybe their biggest plan was to get Kyrie Irving [VIDEO] this year.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100, "id": 956, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316228", "label": {"eng": "Point forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319678", "label": {"eng": "Small forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329078", "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "392307", "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "503756", "label": {"eng": "Danny Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "960510", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}]}

But now Cleveland may have its eyes on a certain basketball unicorn playing in New York City.\n\nKnicks forward Kristaps Porzingis has become a \"primary target\" for the Cavs, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski . As Cleveland continues its search for a trade partner -- Wojnarowski calls an Irving trade \"inevitable\" -- the franchise is moving forward under the assumption LeBron James won't return following the 2017-18 season, thus the need for a young, emerging star like Porzingis.\n\nThat's not to say the Cavs wouldn't jump at the chance to re-sign James next summer, but owner Dan Gilbert and new general manager Koby Altman understand they cannot be reactive in this situation and risk another nosedive in the standings like the last time James left Cleveland. That's why the Cavs have looked into acquiring players like Jackson, Porzingis, Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum and Nuggets second-year guard Jamal Murray, according to Wojnarowski.\n\nThe problem with adding Porzingis? The Cavs would be forced to take on Joakim Noah's albatross of a contract. Noah is owed more than $55 million over the next three years after signing a four-year, $72 million deal with the Knicks in the summer of 2016. Wojnarowski describes the conversation as a \"nonstarter\" for New York.\n\nFurther complicating matters is Porzingis' relationship with the Knicks organization. This offseason has been a tumultuous one for the 7-3 monster out of Latvia, as he has seen his favorite assistant coach fired and his name dangled in trade talks , most recently in a report stating former Knicks president Phil Jackson wanted to add Lonzo Ball by trading Porzingis for the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft.\n\nPorzingis has done his best to quell concerns by publicly stating he considers New York \"home\" and wants to stay with the Knicks for his entire career . Maybe the removal of Phil Jackson will help put Porzingis' mind at ease, but with these new rumors and the constant drama surrounding a possible trade of Carmelo Anthony, the Knicks and Porzingis may realize it's best to part sooner rather than later.\n\nFor now, the Cavs will keep perusing the NBA landscape in the hopes a team grows impatient and wants to make a big splash for Irving.

Of course, Cavs owner Dan Gilbert and new GM Kobe Altman pull out all the stops to lock in the four-time NBA MVP long-term.\n\nHowever, the Cavs' ownership also aware there no guarantee in James once he hits the free-agency market. The organization learned it the hard way in 2010 when LeBron left for greener pasture in South Beach. In short, they are trying to leverage Irving's trade value [VIDEO] to get a legit rising star and avoid falling into the same hole again. As what Wojnarowski stated, the Cavs are high on Porzingis either to support James or lead the Cavs to a new era.\n\nAs for the Knicks, it looks like the drama continues weeks removed from the Phil Jackson's shenanigans. Jackson has already been fired, but his ghost apparently is still lurking somewhere in the Knicks' front-office. [VIDEO]\n\nRight now, the working partnership Steve Mills and Scott Perry hasn't achieved any major breakthrough. Carmelo Anthony is still a Knick and they are lagging behind Eastern Conference rivals in terms of firepower. Porzingis, whose skill-set is rare even in today's game, is the Knicks' last hope for many reasons.\n\nThe reports of Knicks entertaining the idea of using Porzingis to dump Noah's contract is absurd. It evokes the question \"Do the Knicks really well past the P-Jax era or will there be more nightmarish trades yet to come? #NBA Trade Rumors #Kristaps Porzingis trade rumors", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100, "id": 153, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306566", "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "368316", "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "392642", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "489035", "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

the future,\" a source told Newsday. \"In all the discussions since then -- there were other rumors before that Cleveland would want Kristaps -- and it didn't seem that [the Knicks] were interested at all in a conversation.\"\n\nThe update came after Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.com reported earlier Tuesday the Cavs made Porzingis a \"primary\" target in Irving trade discussions, which have centered on young franchise cornerstones since LeBron James' future in Cleveland is unsettled beyond the 2017-18 season.\n\nAlthough the 22-year-old Latvia native popped up in the rumor mill earlier in the offseason, that speculation has faded considerably since the Knicks parted ways with former team president Phil Jackson.\n\nPorzingis expressed a desire to remain in New York for the long haul during a conversation with Shaun Powell of NBA.com before the NBA Africa Game in South Africa earlier this month.\n\n\"So far it's been tough in New York, but my journey is only beginning and I hope to stay there my whole career, so as a city we can have some fun and win some games and do something big,\" he said. \"For me, it's now home.\"\n\nIf the Knicks are unwilling to include him in Irving trade talks, it will be another example of Cleveland being unable to convince other teams to insert their top young assets in the conversation.\n\nTerry Pluto of the Cleveland Plain Dealer previously reported the Denver Nuggets would not give up Jamal Murray and Gary Harris in a possible Irving trade.\n\nWojnarowski listed Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum and Phoenix Suns forward Josh Jackson

The Cavaliers have witnessed James' exit strategy twice -- once to leave Cleveland and once to return -- and the Irving trade request has left them unwilling to squander the opportunity to replenish young assets on a roster that could be crippled in a post-James Cavaliers era that is stocked with high-priced veterans.\n\nThe Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\n\nThis is not the strategy I'd take.\n\nThe Cavaliers are as much on the cusp of a title as any other team can be while these Warriors exist. It's so hard to reach that point, I wouldn't downgrade even a feint chance at a championship this year for a boost in rebuilding back to this point in some vague future. The Cavs, without shame, could go the entire career of whatever player they get for Irving without contending for a title. They know the opportunity is in front of them right now.\n\nIf LeBron committed to Cleveland long-term, I'd prioritize players who could help the next 2-3 years. If he won't commit long-term, I'd push all-in for this season - one last chance to win a championship with LeBron. That means targeting players whose value is mostly derived from the upcoming season - players on expiring contracts and older players. (The Cavs already missed on the player who, by far, best fits that mold: Paul George.)\n\nLeBron might be less likely to return to a team ravished by 2018 free agency and aging, but a title this season would last forever. It also might be harder for him to leave a defending champion.\n\nThe Cavaliers' actual strategy seemingly has a clearer effect. If LeBron hasn't made up his mind, this could push him out. He might even be leaning toward re-signing with the Cavs. But that becomes far less appealing if the team stocks up on young players not ready to win.\n\nUltimately, LeBron must bear the weight of Cleveland going down this path. He allows rumors about the Lakers to linger unchecked - even feeding into them. If he wanted the Cavaliers to build around him, he could signal his commitment. Instead, he has only expressed his dismay - directly and indirectly - with their offseason.\n\nI think this is largely about power - LeBron wanting the Cavs to commit to him without him committing to them. They do all the heavy lifting of building a roster for him, and he might return, or he might not. It's a game they've played before, and one I'd play again. They seem tired of it.\n\nIt's technically not too late for LeBron to privately pledge loyalty and send the organization on a different trade route. This report might even be from Cleveland, trying to light a fire under him. But it seems extremely unlikely for LeBron to become suddenly committal.\n\nAnd then there's Irving. The Cavaliers want a young star? Good luck finding someone better than Irving. Porzingis, Tatum, Jackson and Murray all offer more team control - and that's extremely important, especially if Irving is unhappy in Cleveland. But the Cavs would be surrendering talent in all deals besides Porzingis - plus the chance Irving rescinds his trade request in a post-LeBron world.\n\nMaybe the Cavaliers should just keep Irving another year and hope the distractions remain mild enough that the team can still compete for a title. If LeBron returns and/or Irving still wants out, they could always trade Irving next summer.\n\nRight now, Cleveland has a shot at the 2018 championship and a 25-year-old four-time All-Star. It seems the Cavs are fine losing both.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316894", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "365551", "label": {"eng": "Exit strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1126832", "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

After all, he's one of the top offensive players in the league and players of his caliber aren't usually available for trade. However, it seems the San Antonio Spurs may have an edge over the rest of the competition.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Irving is willing to sign an extension if he's traded to the Spurs. However, the team does not have the assets the Cleveland Cavaliers want in exchange for the All-Star point guard.\n\nBecause of the uncertainty surrounding LeBron James' future with the team, the Cavaliers are seeking a very specific package in any deal for Irving. They want a draft pick and veteran starter who can help them win games next season. And most importantly, they want a young budding star to be part of the package as well in case they have to do a soft rebuild.\n\nThe Spurs have a lot of veterans on their roster and they should be willing to move them to acquire Irving. They can also give the Cavaliers a draft pick, although that pick will likely be near the bottom of the draft next year. The problem is, the Spurs just don't have the young player that the Cavaliers want.\n\n\"The Spurs have interest in Irving, league sources say, and Irving's willingness to commit to an extension with the Spurs makes for legitimate win-now deal possibilities for Cleveland.

The Spurs seem to like the idea of a trade at the very least, and Irving has made it known he'd sign a contract extension to help a deal go through. However, the Cleveland Cavaliers may not be as interested in a deal with the Spurs due to the Cavs' plan moving forward. Once again, it will come down to their superstar LeBron James and his future with the team. Here are the latest details on the Cavs' Kyrie Irving, what San Antonio could give up, and why Cleveland might not be so interested in the deal as they look ahead.\n\nOn Thursday, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the Spurs could offer the Cleveland Cavaliers players such as LaMarcus Aldridge, Tony Parker, and Danny Green in a potential deal for the Cavs' All-Star guard. However, Cleveland is not as interested in the \"win-now deal\" which these veteran players would give them. This is mainly due to the fact that LeBron James is going to be a free agent at the end of the season and could be headed elsewhere. Rumors have suggested LeBron will end up with the Los Angeles Lakers for the next stage of his career, which means it will be the second time he chooses to depart Cleveland for a new scene.\n\nWith the knowledge of the possibilities of both their top stars leaving the team, Cleveland is much more interested in making a trade for younger players or draft pick assets to allow them to rebuild their team. Unfortunately for the San Antonio Spurs, they just don't have much in the way of those assets to offer the Cavaliers. Teams that have popped up in the ongoing NBA trade rumors about Kyrie Irving have included the Phoenix Suns and New York Knicks, as each of these squads can offer the right mixture of younger players and picks.\n\nOnce again, though, these deals are not going through due to those teams' reluctance to part with their potential future stars. For the Suns, it's their No. 4 pick Josh Jackson, and for the NY Knicks, it's Kristaps Porzingis that the team wants to keep. Carmelo Anthony was even mentioned as a potential trade asset for the Knicks to send to the Cavs, but Anthony is only interested in being sent to the Houston Rockets.\n\nAnother team that's been mentioned in Kyrie Irving trade rumors, but that hasn't actively made an offer, is the Boston Celtics. Reportedly, the Cavaliers are interested in their newest young star Jayson Tatum as part of a deal. However, there have been no conversations between the two teams. Boston also has upcoming draft picks and some other assets that could potentially work in a deal. Still, reports indicate that many of the teams interested in making a deal for Irving will wait until around September to get more serious.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs fans probably wouldn't mind seeing Kyrie Irving on the same court with NBA MVP finalist Kawhi Leonard. That would provide a powerful one-two punch and possibly give Kyrie the type of role he wants on a team where the other star defers to him. Leonard is a proven defensive stud who isn't always known for high-scoring performances. Irving would be able to provide more of that, as well as another great \"go to\" option when the team needs late buckets. Still, the hangup is due to Cleveland having no interest in trying to win against the Warriors over the short term when they have a long term team to manage.\n\nSo while the idea for a Kyrie Irving trade to San Antonio is great, it seems like a far-fetched fantasy situation at this point for Spurs fans. Cleveland still holds the leverage in the deals, though, and will likely continue to shop for the best possible deal for them going forward. More of those should arrive as the NBA season arrives. In all reality, the Cavs have more than just a season to field plenty of offers.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199248"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316894", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334399", "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "345909", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "368316", "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

In essence, it's difficult for new Cleveland general manager Koby Altman to do what's best for the organization, because it's impossible to know what's best for the organization:\n\nOf course, Cavaliers officials prefer to re-sign James to a long-term deal and chase titles together into his twilight, but the Cavs are treating his unwillingness to commit as a call to protect themselves long term in the Irving trade, league sources said.\n\nIf LeBron, who has a full no-trade clause, plans to stay, the best possible path for the Cavaliers might be to acquire players who can win now, which opens the door for a number of additional trade possibilities involving Irving. But if LeBron plans to leave, Cleveland's most logical route would be to seek players who the team can build around in his absence, and that severely limits the options in dealing the disgruntled point guard, because there are few better building blocks than a 25-year-old former No. 1 pick and four-time All-Star.\n\n[Now's the time to sign up for Fantasy Football! Join for free]\n\nWithout a commitment from LeBron, the Cavs are intent on landing a blue-chip recent lottery pick in return for Irving -- a list that includes budding New York Knicks star Kristaps Porzingis, Denver Nuggets sophomore scoring sensation Jamal Murray or recent top-five picks Jayson Tatum and Josh Jackson, according to Wojnarowski -- but so far teams are refusing to meet Cleveland's asking price.\n\nIn recent weeks, it's become clear the Cavs are straddling the fence between winning in the present and building for the future, as they reportedly seek a quality veteran starter who can help LeBron this season, along with a talented young wing and a future first-round pick who they can market to fans should their superstar leave next summer. A Suns package of point guard Eric Bledsoe, Jackson and a pick seemed to make the most sense, but Phoenix has been unwilling to include Jackson in its offer:\n\nThe Phoenix Suns will NOT include Josh Jackson in any trade for Kyrie Irving.\n\n-- John Gambadoro (@Gambo987) July 25, 2017\n\nInstead, the Suns reportedly offered a pick, Bledsoe and Dragan Bender, who struggled through an injury-plagued rookie campaign in 2016-17. The Nuggets and Boston Celtics would presumably take the same approach in keeping Murray and Tatum out of any potential trade offer, particularly since neither team appeared on the reported list of Irving's preferred trade destinations, which included only the Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. It's unwise for any other team to offer a package of equal value without assurance Irving would re-sign as a free agent in 2019.\n\n[Follow Ball Don't Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr]\n\nFormer Cavaliers GM David Griffin twice suggested the Celtics were among Irving's preferred landing spots, but Boston has not extended an offer, per Wojnarowski, let alone shown any sign of meeting Cleveland's presumed demands of a package including, say, Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder and Tatum.\n\nAnd why would the Knicks swap Porzingis, who is still on his rookie contract, for Irving? The whole point of New York dealing for the Cavs point guard would be to pair the New Jersey native with the Latvian 7-footer and take the next step toward respectability, but a Knicks team with Irving and no Porzingis is in the same predicament of needing several more building blocks around one supremely talented foundational player. Not to mention New York just spent its 2017 lottery pick on a point guard, 19-year-old French prospect Frank Ntilikina.\n\nTimberwolves owner Glen Taylor recently told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that Andrew Wiggins \"is not available to anybody in a trade,\" which led Griffin to \"scratch off one potential trade destination\" for Irving, considering Minnesota's other young stud, Karl-Anthony Towns, is also an untouchable. Meanwhile, the Heat publicly denied a report suggesting they offered former All-NBA point guard Goran Dragic and potential breakout candidate Justice Winslow \"as centerpieces for an Irving trade.\"\n\nRead More\n\nThat leaves the Spurs on Irving's list, and they present the catch-22 scenario LeBron's uncertain future creates for the Cavaliers, according to Wojnarowski. San Antonio can offer the veteran starters to help a James-led Cavs team this season, but outside of promising second-year guard Dejounte Murray and the their own (presumably) late first-round pick as underwhelming alternatives, the Spurs appear to be yet another team that can't produce the youth Cleveland requires as a safety net without LeBron.\n\nWhat good are LaMarcus Aldridge and Danny Green without James in Cleveland? Both can also opt out of eight-figure salaries next season, leaving the Cavaliers in the predicament of losing a large part of their return on Irving or re-signing two more veterans to a team that's already saddled with paying Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver more than $65 million in 2019-20.\n\nIt seems Cleveland is coming to the realization that they cannot get equal value for Irving and could lose James to boot, which means the title window is closing quick and the Cavaliers may be on the verge of once again becoming the franchise that reached a conference finals just once without LeBron.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nBen Rohrbach is a contributor for Ball Don't Lie and Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.

For James, a reluctance to commit comes with an emerging set of complications. Beyond Irving's decision to ask for a trade, Cleveland has determined that it's unwilling to simply be reactive to James' possible departure.\n\nOf course, Cavaliers officials prefer to re-sign James to a long-term deal and chase titles together into his twilight, but the Cavs are treating his unwillingness to commit as a call to protect themselves long term in the Irving trade, league sources said.\n\nOwner Dan Gilbert and general manager Koby Altman want James to commit before building around him, and James largely wants to see the Cavaliers execute a plan before committing to them.\n\nCleveland's case for commitment is this: We've had the highest payroll in the NBA, run luxury tax bills north of $75 million since James' return. Trust our commitment to winning.\n\nJames' case for hesitancy is this: Accomplished GM David Griffin is gone, replaced with Altman, a young, unproven executive.\n\nJames sees a summer in which the franchise failed to make a deal for Paul George and failed to close the gap on Golden State. Ultimately, liberation born of that 2016 Cleveland championship allows James and the organization to take these disparate paths.\n\nJames can leave again, because the Cavaliers won a title. Gilbert can threaten to embark on a soft rebuild in James' final season, because the Cavaliers won a title.\n\nThe process of building out the franchise's roster long term has accelerated with Irving's trade request. The Cavaliers have witnessed James' exit strategy twice -- once to leave Cleveland and once to return -- and the Irving trade request has left them unwilling to squander the opportunity to replenish young assets on a roster that could be crippled in a post-James Cavaliers era that is stocked with high-priced veterans.\n\nThe Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors have impacted the way the NBA and its stars do business, and no one -- not even a franchise that possesses the generation's greatest player -- wants to be left compromised long term for what's a fleeting chance to beat Golden State in the short term.\n\nCleveland is determined to get an elite young player for Irving, which means this: The trade plan the Cavaliers would have prioritized, with James committed for the long term -- veterans to surround James and draft picks -- isn't in motion. If the Cavaliers knew they had James committed, for example, San Antonio could emerge as a more intriguing trade partner. The Spurs have interest in Irving, league sources say, and Irving's willingness to commit to an extension with the Spurs makes for legitimate win-now deal possibilities for Cleveland. Without James beyond next season, though, the likes of LaMarcus Aldridge, Tony Parker and Danny Green hold no appeal.\n\nBoston has expressed interest in Irving and could offer the best combination of short-term (Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder) and long-term (Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, picks) assets. The Celtics have made no formal offer, and it is against Boston's front-office DNA to push out front with the most generous offer. Boston knows that Cleveland is mostly intrigued with Tatum, but the sides have not formally discussed that deal, league sources said.\n\nThis Irving trade process has been deliberate, and teams believe the Cavaliers expect more aggressive conversations in September, closer to the start of training camps. Porzingis has emerged as a primary Cleveland target, but that's a conversation that can occur only with Cleveland's willingness to unburden the Knicks of the three years and $55 million left on Joakim Noah's contract. For now, the conversation is a nonstarter for the Knicks, league sources said.\n\nFor the right All-Star player, though -- Irving or otherwise -- multiple NBA teams are seriously questioning how emphatic of a \"no\" that will stay for New York. There continues to be distance between Porzingis and the organization, and how the Knicks truly value Porzingis' future could become clearer once they're together to begin the season.\n\nMilwaukee has shown interest in Irving, too, league sources said, but there isn't that one young star -- of course, Giannis Antetokounmpo is untouchable -- who makes sense for Cleveland.\n\nWhen Irving's trade request became public in mid-July, there was internal hope that the news would stir the market to furnish Cleveland with a return that could deliver impact to the 2017-18 season with James, as well as the possibility of a future without him. That hasn't happened, and it's become clear that Irving isn't commanding that kind of robust return on the market.\n\nBetween now and the inevitable Irving trade, Cleveland officials will make a choice on what the franchise values most -- its today or its tomorrow. Without a commitment to stay, without the presumption of a future together, LeBron James could be left in a most unfamiliar position: out of championship contention in Cleveland, counting the days until goodbye.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "307687", "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "384776", "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jae_Crowder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "389203", "label": {"eng": "Jae Crowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "508968", "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1126832", "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270415", "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

The situation makes for legitimate win-now deal possibilities for Cleveland, said, Wojnarowski. Earlier, there were concerns about Irving's unwillingness to sign a contract extension with the team that will acquire him from the Cavaliers. The Phoenix Suns don't want to trade No. 4 overall pick Josh Jackson for Irving because the latter is not ready to commit to a long-term deal to the team that will trade for him.\n\nOn the other hand, Irving is willing to sign an extension if he's shipped to the Spurs, one of four teams that he mentioned to Cavs owner Dan Gilbert when he demanded a trade. The three others are the Miami Heat, New York Knicks and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Irving demanded a trade because he wants to become the No. 1 option for a team and he's tired of playing second fiddle to LeBron James. Irving has three years remaining on his five-year, $94 million deal with the Cavaliers but he can opt out after the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe Spurs could offer win-now veterans LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green or even Tony Parker to the Cavaliers for Irving. Before the 2017 NBA Draft, the Spurs explored the possibility of trading Aldridge in exchange for a top 10 pick, but they failed to find a taker.\n\nHowever, Cleveland's next move on Irving hinges on James' next decision [VIDEO], on whether he will sign a long-term deal with the Cavaliers or leave Cleveland for the second time in 2018. If James decides to leave the Cavaliers in 2018, the deal involving Aldridge, Green, and Parker could become less attractive to Cleveland, which might turn its focus on young assets. The Spurs currently have talented Dejounte Murray and Kyle Anderson, but both are far from the level of future building blocks for a team.\n\nCurrently, the Spurs don't have a starting point guard as Parker is out for four to five months as he recovers from injury. They are expected to start Patty Mills, who recently signed a four-year deal worth $50 million while Murray will back him up. Irving and Kawhi Leonard could make a formidable tandem for the Spurs.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199248"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "322747", "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "344563", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "503756", "label": {"eng": "Danny Green (basketball)"}}]}

However, James could ultimately play a major role in Irving's final destination, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nNBA TRADE RUMORS: Cavs targeting Kristaps Porzingis?\n\nWhen he informed Cleveland's front office of his desire to be dealt, Irving also reportedly submitted the Cavs' brass with a list of four preferred landing sports -- the Timberwolves, Heat, Spurs and Knicks. Obviously, a move to San Antonio (61-21 last season), where he'd play under coach Gregg Popovich and alongside two-time Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard, would (at least on paper) give Irving the best chance to contend for a title against next season. Irving also makes sense for the Spurs' future, as he is willing to commit to a long-term extension beyond the two years remaining on his current contract.\n\nBut if James, who becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer, continues to hold a non-committal stance with the Cavs beyond 2017-18, any potential deal with the Spurs could be off.\n\nAs Wojnarowski noted, the Spurs have pieces like Tony Parker, LaMarcus Aldridge and Danny Green to keep the Cavs, owners of the NBA's most expensive payroll, in pursuit of another trip to the NBA Finals amid an Eastern Conference that will feature a Celtics squad bolstered by the addition of Gordon Hayward. But staying in win-now mode presents a problem if James feels he is better off spending the rest of his career outside of the state of Ohio, and a trade with San Antonio could leave Cleveland stuck with pricey veterans and no building blocks for the future. As it stands, Cleveland must put its effort into pursuing trade partners that could offer a young star such as Knicks big man Kristaps Porzingis or Suns rookie Josh Jackson in the event James takes his talents elsewhere when his contract expires.\n\nAs much as he wants to strike out on his own, Irving, like the rest of the Cavs organization, is at the King's mercy.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219910"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329076", "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329078", "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "339133", "label": {"eng": "NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "392642", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

As such, they want to use the return in an Irving trade to protect and prepare themselves for a possible future without either Irving or James by acquiring one of those star young players they can build their future around.\n\nBecause San Antonio doesn't have any young stars that fit the bill, they will need LeBron to commit to the Cavs long-term. That happens and Cleveland starts looking to acquire veterans to help them win a championship, which is when the Spurs' available players would come into play.\n\nThe other three teams on Irving's list were the Miami Heat, Minnesota Timberwolves and New York Knicks, though the Phoenix Suns and Detroit Pistons have been the two other teams expressing the most interest.\n\nIrving averaged a career-high 25.2 points and 5.8 assists per game last season.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199248"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "322747", "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002\u201303_San_Antonio_Spurs_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "402603", "label": {"eng": "2002\u201303 San Antonio Spurs season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "503756", "label": {"eng": "Danny Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)#No-trade_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "592613", "label": {"eng": "No-trade clause"}}]}

The latest from the rumor mill suggests that the Cavs are targeting young stars in exchange for Irving while #David Robinson wants the #San Antonio Spurs to acquire Kyrie Irving.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs was reportedly one of Kyrie Irving's preferred landing spots [VIDEO] if and when he gets traded. While the Spurs have a line up that is deemed good enough to challenge any team in the NBA, a Spurs team with Kyrie Irving in tow would be downright scary-good.\n\nDavid Robinson, the long time San Antonio Spurs legend, seems to think so too. Speaking with Siris XM NBA Radio, Robinson didn't mince words in stating his desire for the Spurs to acquire the former All-Star MVP. \"We'd be crazy not to want a talented guy (Irving) like that,\" said The Admiral.\n\nRobinson suggests that a player like Irving playing in the Spurs system would only get better regarding efficiency. And who knows this better than David Robinson, the man who has been the face of the Spurs franchise on his way to winning two NBA rings?\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers want to get good value in return for Kyrie Irving. Of the rumored 20 offers they received during the first week of the Kyrie Irving Sweepstakes, it seems that the Cavs didn't like any of the trade deals.\n\nAccording to reports, the Cavs want a blue chip young player on a rookie contract, a veteran star, and a first-round draft pick in return for Kyrie Irving.\n\nSo far, they have no takers. Basketball pundits suggest that the best offer the Cavs had was from the Phoenix Suns. The Suns have the assets and allegedly offered Eric Bledsoe, Dragan Bender, and Miami Heat's 2018 first-round draft pick. The deal didn't push through because the Cavs reportedly want Josh Jackson instead of Dragan Bender. And the Suns appear adamant in not parting ways with the young Jackson.\n\nThat being said, the Cleveland Cavaliers are still reportedly on the hunt for that young star, and Kristaps Porzingis of the New York Knicks fits the bill. While New York is seemingly in disarray these days especially with the Carmelo Anthony situation, the Knicks management has recently stated that Porzingis is off the table, so the chances of Cavs landing Porzingis are slim.\n\nNow that both Josh Jackson and Kristaps Porzingis are seemingly untouchable, the Cleveland Cavaliers are turning their eyes on Jason Tatum of the Boston Celtics and Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets.\n\nBoth Tatum and Murray are talented young players who could become the foundation of the franchise if LeBron James were to bolt next season.\n\nHowever, if James stays a Cavalier next season, Porzingis, Jackson, Tatum, or Murray could have an immediate impact for the Cavaliers. Until the Cavaliers pull any of these possible trade deals off, Kyrie Irving will stay as a Cavalier and will have to re-learn how to coexist, again, with the rest of the Cavs.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322747", "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323680", "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "326020", "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robinson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "396435", "label": {"eng": "David Robinson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "717462", "label": {"eng": "Eric Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Bender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1288854", "label": {"eng": "Dragan Bender"}}]}

If the team was confident LeBron was staying, they'd be more willing to focus on adding veterans who can help contend for a title in the short-term.\n\nThe process of building out the franchise's roster long term has accelerated with Irving's trade request. The Cavaliers have witnessed James' exit strategy twice -- once to leave Cleveland and once to return -- and the Irving trade request has left them unwilling to squander the opportunity to replenish young assets on a roster that could be crippled in a post-James Cavaliers era that is stocked with high-priced veterans.\n\nThe Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\n\nWojnarowski goes on to say that the San Antonio Spurs would make sense as a trade partner in a potential Irving deal because they have veterans like LaMarcus Aldridge, Tony Parker and Danny Green. However, adding players like that only works if the Cavs are focused solely on winning now. If LeBron left next summer, they'd have a roster with expensive veterans that might not be good enough to win the East.\n\nFrom the way it sounds, LeBron and the Cavs are in a bit of a stalemate. The team wants to know if James is staying so it can proceed with the Irving talks accordingly, and LeBron wants to know what the roster is going to look like in a year before he gives Cleveland a commitment. We've already heard specific teams mentioned that might make sense for LeBron in a year, and he could decide that he has a better chance to win elsewhere depending on how the Irving trade goes.\n\nWhat should have been a relatively quiet offseason in Cleveland is suddenly anything but.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100, "id": 374, "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "365551", "label": {"eng": "Exit strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Green_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "503756", "label": {"eng": "Danny Green (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

The Knicks' Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Canadian guard Jamal Murray of the Nuggets are all on the Cavs' wish list.\n\nA young star is key for Cleveland because of the uncertain future of LeBron James. The Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer has a player option next off-season and rumours have been swirling about him leaving Cleveland for the second time.\n\nThe Cavs aren't giving up on the possibility of re-signing James next summer, but they are no longer investing blind faith in the hope he will stay. For James, a reluctance to commit comes with an emerging set of complications. Beyond Irving's decision to ask for a trade, Cleveland has determined that it's unwilling to simply be reactive to James' possible departure.\n\nJames' next decision weighs heavily on the Irving deal because the Cavs will need a player that they can build around for years to come. A young star would allow Cleveland to have insurance just in case James leaves next off-season.\n\nA backup plan is a must because the last time James left, it was an utter disaster. James was gone for four seasons from 2010-11 through 2013-14 and Cleveland posted a combined record of 97-215 during that span.\n\nWith James and Irving as major focal points, the Cavaliers have made three straight NBA Finals, winning the championship in 2015-16. Despite that success, a strained relationship between the two stars has emerged and a divorce seems to be inevitable, per Wojnarowski.\n\nNo deal involving Irving appears to be imminent as the point guard has not commanded the type of market value Cleveland envisioned.\n\nWhen Irving's trade request became public in mid-July, there was internal hope that the news would stir the market to furnish Cleveland with a return that could deliver impact to the 2017-18 season with James, as well as the possibility of a future without him. That hasn't happened, and it's become clear that Irving isn't commanding that kind of robust return on the market.\n\nDespite the slow-moving nature of trade talks, rival teams are under the impression that the Cavaliers expect more aggressive conversations in September as training camps draw nearer.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "loc", "id": "37"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306490", "label": {"eng": "Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324512", "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_franchise_career_scoring_leaders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1191566", "label": {"eng": "List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

The biggest exception to that is the expected trade of Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving who demanded to be dealt last month.\n\nThis put the Cavaliers in a real bind as not only is Irving asking to be moved, but LeBron James will be a free agent next summer and there is no guarantee that he will remain in Cleveland beyond this season. Rumors have been rampant that James could join the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018.\n\nWith LeBron's free agency looming over the Irving deal, the Cavaliers are reportedly focused not on making a win-now move, but rather landing a young star according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski:\n\n\"The Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\"\n\nCleveland's mindset makes sense from their point of view. Moving Irving for more established players would make them better immediately, but should LeBron leave next summer, they would be stuck with a below average team with little potential to grow.\n\nBy landing someone like Tatum, Jackson, or Murray they might take a step back in the short-term, but it would set them up to have a future cornerstone. It is a difficult line to balance for a franchise expected to compete for a championship.\n\nThe good news for the Cavaliers is that Irving has no control over where he can land. While Irving does have a list of preferred destinations, Cleveland can send him to whoever gives them the best deal and with Irving still having two years left on his deal, teams will be more willing to give up a little more for the four-time All-Star.\n\nThere is still plenty that could happen before training camp kicks off and this will surely be a story to watch over the next few weeks.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "wgt": 100, "id": 534, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316894", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

It is possible that the Cavaliers could go from making four consecutive trips to the NBA Finals to not even making the postseason, which may explain why they may be looking to the future and dreaming of the possibility of adding New York Knicks big man Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nAccording to a recent report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, \"Porzingis has emerged as a primary Cleveland target.\"\n\nPresumably, since Irving reportedly wants out of town anyway, the Cavaliers may be open to just shipping him to the Knicks in exchange for Porzingis. It is not going to be that simple however.\n\nWojnarowski even noted in the aforementioned report that the Cavaliers may have to take on the onerous contract of center Joakim Noah to make progress on a deal involving Porzingis, which will not be easy for them to do.\n\nThe Cavaliers already have plenty of money committed to their roster, so they would have to flip other useful players and Irving to the Knicks to get back Porzingis and Noah, and at that point, they may have weakened their roster to the point where they may struggle to even make it back to the NBA Finals, let alone win the championship.\n\nFailure to make the NBA Finals next year could also serve to push James out of town even more.\n\nIt is an incredibly tough spot to be in as acquiring Porzingis may be better for the Cavaliers' long-term outlook but it could hamstring their title chances for the upcoming season.\n\nWhether or not the Cavaliers end up pushing hard for Porzingis could depend on what they have decided to do.\n\nIf they decide that building for the future should be their main objective, then doing all they can to acquire Porzingis may be their next course of action, but if winning the championship next year remains the primary goal, then they may have to deal Irving for different players.\n\nMore news about the latest NBA trade rumors should be made available soon.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Tools_and_Equipment", "wgt": 100, "id": 309, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Tools and Equipment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

They want young players to build a new foundation upon in case LeBron James leaves, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe Cavs have yet to get a commitment from James beyond next season, according to the report. They've seen him shift gears enough to know what his exit strategy looks like and they're doing their best to prepare for it.\n\nCleveland is determined to get an elite young player for Irving, which means this: The trade plan the Cavaliers would have prioritized, with James committed for the long term -- veterans to surround James and draft picks -- isn't in motion.\n\nThe Cavs fully intend to keep James through the remainder of his career, but without a commitment from him, they have to be proactive in their quest to stay afloat.\n\nThat's a smart strategy in the best interest of the franchise, but it may also alienate James and push him even further out the door. Their team won't be as good this season as they were the previous two years with more experienced talent. In James' last year, it's important to maximize what could be his last year in Cleveland.\n\nIf they compete now, he'll have a difficult time leaving. If they don't, it's an easy decision for him to make. The Cavs have some tough decisions to make.\n\nIt's one thing for James to play with younger players -- Irving was only 22 years old when James returned to the Cavaliers. But the circumstances now are different. The Cavs are considering first- or second-year prospects who won't be fully developed in time to compete for a title with James.\n\nJames is focused on winning rings, and he needs the players around him to do the same. It's unrealistic to ask most first- or second-year players to contribute in any meaningful way in deep playoff runs.\n\nJames knows that. That's why he pushed for the Cavs to trade Andrew Wiggins to Minnesota for Kevin Love and, eventually, gave his blessing on the Dion Waiters trade.\n\nAccording to the report, the Cavs are interested in Kristaps Porzingis, Jayson Tatum, Josh Jackson, and Jamal Murray, but everyone in that group is 22 years old or younger. James is 32 years old and will be 33 by the time the playoffs start. Be doesn't have time to bring them along slowly.\n\nEven with Irving at 22, there were -- and still are -- growing pains in his relationship with James on and off the court. Going through that again, with lesser talents, is not an option for the four-time MVP.\n\nAll that said, with their future fluctuating on the whims of both James and Irving, the Cavaliers have a duty to prepare for life without them. Getting veteran players who help win championships this season doesn't do that.\n\nSure, solid veteran players might help keep James around next summer. But he still won't commit to a decision no matter what the return in the Irving deal ends up being -- or if it even happens at all. James is a master businessman and decision maker who always keeps his options open. He won't change that just because of a new acquisition or two.\n\nTrading for youth sets the Cavaliers up for the long-term, and that's their best bet to remain competitive in the future. James' best years are behind him, even if he's still amazing and chasing championships.\n\nThe Warriors are still the team to beat in the league and no one is coming close anytime soon. The league is thinking differently because of their presence and, even though they have James, the Cavs may need to do the same. Building for the future is their best move.\n\nIt seems inevitable that Irving will be traded, and it's difficult to gauge what his value is on the market. In recent months, superstars like Paul George, Jimmy Butler, and DeMarcus Cousins have been traded for cents on the dollar at marquee positions in the league. But they had fewer years left on their contracts and/or were playing for clubs stuck on the treadmill of mediocrity.\n\nIrving is playing a position where there's a plethora of talent as a guard. With that said, 20 teams have reportedly already showed some interest in the four-time all-star, with six of the 20 teams making actual offers to Cleveland.\n\nIrving's talent speaks for itself. He's one of the best scorers in the league and can get whatever shot he wants at anytime. Even with his flaws, his shot creation is an invaluable skill, especially during playoff time.\n\nTrading for Irving shouldn't come cheap. The Cavs are demanding a young prospect, a veteran ready to contribute, and some sort of draft compensation. That sounds about right for a player of Irving's stature, even in a dwindling trade market. Irving is committed to whatever team he's traded to for at least two more seasons.

While some fans would welcome his flashy play in Madison Square Garden, would it make sense to put together a lavish package for the Cavaliers' guard?\n\nSimply put: no.\n\nThe Cavs No. 1 trade target for Kyrie is Kristaps Porzingis. Cleveland would also take on Joakim Noah's massive contract. -- Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nRecent reports suggest that Cleveland considers Kristaps Porzingis a franchise cornerstone as they prepare for a second post-LeBron era. However, this price, which would almost certainly include other players and/or picks, should be too high for the Knicks.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons for and against making this trade, but perhaps the biggest reason for the Knicks to reject the Cavs' offer is the defensive capabilities of both players.\n\nUndoubtedly, Kyrie Irving is one of the most talented guards in the NBA today, but his excellent scoring ability overshadows the fact that he is a decided negative on the defensive end. In 2016-17, Irving posted a career-worst -2.3 defensive box plus/minus, and he allowed opponents to shoot 49.9% from the field, the highest DFG% amongst All-Star caliber guards in the NBA last season.\n\nCould sub-par defense be limiting Kyrie Irving's trade value?

Porzingis allowed his opponents to shoot 42.2% from the field, which was the lowest among starting forwards last season (with >16 attempts). While these stats are a bit specific, it shows that KP, if he can continue to develop, has the makings of an excellent rim protector moving forward.\n\nEven beyond defense, Porzingis provides the type of versatility that most fans would say is necessary in the modern NBA. He can score with his back to the basket (although he needs to improve in the post), and has a very polished jumper for a big man. If Carmelo Anthony is moved (or if his role is diminished this season), KP will get a chance to grow as a scorer and a number one option for New York.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310749", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "318556", "label": {"eng": "Film score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323684", "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "345909", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

After a flurry of stars moving via trade and free agency, it is ironic that the biggest news of the summer was just a trade request. However, it was hardly just a trade request - it was Kyrie Irving, the hero of the 2016 NBA finals and LeBron James' trusted sidekick, requesting to be traded from the Cleveland Cavaliers. Irving is only 25 years old and has two years remaining on his current contract.\n\nIrving's request has wide-ranging implications for the league. While the Cavs are under no contractual obligation to trade their star point guard, it would look terrible for the organization to hold onto a disgruntled player and force him to play for the team he has publically stated he wants to leave. Ironically, James, with his 2010 free agency \"The Decision\" television special, was the one who led the wave of star players wanting to control their own destinies, transforming the NBA into a players' league.\n\nForgetting about what a possible haul for Irving would look like in a trade, it is worth exploring how we got here. Even after a disappointing loss in the finals last year, the Cavs were expected to have a quiet offseason, try to improve their bench, and hopefully compete against the Warriors in next year's finals. Irving's trade request certainly shattered Cleveland, but there were notable warning signs that this team was not meant to stay together another year.\n\nIrving has undoubtedly paid close attention to the accolades that a pair of ball-dominant point guards received this past year: James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Having already secured a championship ring and in the prime of his career, Irving could be looking to have his own team and put up those kind of numbers over the course of a season. He could also see the fan support and local media attention that star point guards John Wall and Damian Lillard have received and want the same thing for himself.\n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be the driving factor in his trade request, since Irving led the Cavs in shot attempts and was one of the top five in jersey sales this past season. More importantly, it would most likely be career suicide for Irving to leave just for more control of the offense, since there has been no indication that he can lead a team by himself. The Cavs had a net rating of minus eight when James was on the bench and Irving was on the court last season, and even in the year prior, it was a measly minus 0.5.\n\nAnother potential reason for wanting to escape \"The Land\" stems from a desire to get away from King James. James, while an excellent passer and all-around unselfish player, is particularly demanding as a leader, in the vein of past greats Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. Simply put, James demands excellence from his teammates, and lets them know if they are not playing up to his standard.\n\nAfter a zero-assist game from Irving in 2015, James gave him a stern lecture about passing the ball. Furthermore, playing with James means every move Irving makes is scrutinized. Even so, once again it is doubtful that Irving would not want to play with James anymore, since James has been more than generous in ensuring Irving gets open shots and the spotlight, such as in Game 7 of the 2016 finals.\n\nThe most probable reason for the request is that Irving can see the writing on the wall in Cleveland and wants to get out before the ship sinks. It is no secret that James is a free agent after this season, with his eyes potentially set on a move to Los Angeles. If James were to leave, Irving would be left trying to carry a team with no championship aspirations and no young, exciting prospects with which to rebuild.\n\nAdditionally, there has been turmoil in the front office, with the Cavs' owner Dan Gilbert refusing to extend general manager David Griffin's contract as the NBA Draft and free agency approached. Irving could see an opportunity to escape early and control his own destiny, engineering a trade to a potential contender in Minnesota or San Antonio.\n\nBecause of the uniqueness of the situation - a bona fide superstar wanting off the best team in the Eastern Conference, as well as a team trying to convince its second-best player of all time to stay - it is hard to imagine a trade scenario right now where the Cavs, Irving and the third team in the trade all end up happy.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc", "id": "228323"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "307684", "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "312575", "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "316895", "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wall_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329069", "label": {"eng": "John Wall (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329071", "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329084", "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "344563", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(TV_special)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "660491", "label": {"eng": "The Decision (TV special)"}}]}

It's the Cleveland front office that, like an overprotective future in-law, won't allow this relationship to stomp the glass.\n\nWhen Irving gave the Cavs a wish list of franchises -- San Antonio, Miami, Minnesota, and New York -- that he wanted to be traded to, there was no reason to expect owner Dan Gilbert would honor that request. Irving still has two guaranteed years left on his deal, which doesn't include a no-trade clause; he has little leverage to force anything. As a healthy, 25-year-old, top-10 point guard in the league, the only reason Cleveland may feel dealing Irving is necessary (Woj called his departure \"inevitable\") is, as former Cavs GM David Griffin put it, because Irving could \"sink the ship from within.\" So the Cavs are looking for the most appealing return in the entire NBA, not necessarily just of the four teams Irving wished for -- unless, of course, one of those best benefited Cleveland, which is no longer operating under the assumption that LeBron James is a lock to stay in the city after he enters free agency this summer.\n\nThe Cavs are looking for a specific type of return, a deal that could replace Irving with talent that entices James and is young enough to begin a \"soft rebuild\" should he, too, leave. It's why new GM Koby Altman, per Woj, entertained the idea of trading with the Knicks, lusting after Kristaps Porzingis, and the Timberwolves, considering Andrew Wiggins. But with those players seemingly off-limits for their respective franchises, those talks stalled. The Spurs have no such rising star, only a fully formed one in Kawhi Leonard and the experienced, competent assets that surround him.\n\nIrving's willingness to commit to an extension makes him all the more valuable to San Antonio, which has spent the last few seasons grappling with the idea that 35-year-old Tony Parker is, in fact, aging. Gregg Popovich is a master at cultivating new talent under the leadership of current starters, keeping the Spurs a perennial model of success. Acquiring Irving would bring the type of instant talent boost to the organization that LaMarcus Aldridge was supposed to. Irving's value might persuade the Spurs to deal generously -- the conundrum, as Wojnarowski mentioned, is whether the Cavs have enough trust in James to re-sign that they'll accept anything other than an investment for the long-term future. Parker, Aldridge, and Danny Green would mean little on a roster with Kevin Love, Iman Shumpert, Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith, and Kyle Korver.\n\nShould the Cavs make this transaction -- should Irving get his wish, after all -- it likely means that Cleveland holds faith that the kid from Akron will stay. A court shared by Kawhi and Kyrie is a wonderful thought, but that's what it will likely stay. If LeBron recommitted to Cleveland, it'd open the door to a trade, but Irving shouldn't get his hopes up. Neither, it seems, will Cleveland.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "wgt": 100, "id": 936, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329078", "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "339134", "label": {"eng": "J.

The 25-year-old should command a huge return, likely a combination of draft picks and a star forward to help out LeBron James and Kevin Love right now. Anything less than a king's ransom could be seen as a failure for the Cavaliers -- and worse, it could upset James.\n\nBut finding a team willing to give up the combination of assets that will satisfy the Cavaliers is apparently proving tricky.\n\nSports Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek Sports delivered to your inbox\n\nThe latest report comes from Darren Wolfson of 1500ESPN.com. Wolfson claims the Phoenix Suns want Irving and would be prepared to give up Eric Bledsoe, a first-round draft pick in 2018 or 2019, and the number four overall pick from 2016, Dragan Bender.\n\nThe Cavaliers would ideally like the Suns' rookie Josh Jackson in any deal, but Jackson, the fourth overall pick from the 2017 NBA Draft, doesn't sound too positive about the likelihood of moving to northeast Ohio. \"I think if that [a trade to the Cavaliers] was going to happen, it would have happened by now,\" Jackson said on Sunday in quotes reported by CBS.\n\nGiving up Jackson for Irving would be a major risk for the Suns if Irving doesn't resign with the franchise in 2018 and walks away after a year.\n\nAnother option for Irving, reported at the start of August, is a trade to the Detroit Pistons. The Detroit Free Press reported \"conversations\" between the Pistons' front office and the Cavaliers. Neither the Suns nor the Pistons were on Irving's reported list of preferred trade options.\n\nThe interest in Irving is not the problem. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported at the end of July that \"approximately 20 teams\" had registered interest in Irving. The issue for those teams is in deciding how much they can risk giving up for Irving, and for the Cavaliers, on the other side of the trade, in being adequately compensated for a perennial all-star and elite scorer.\n\nIf no one makes the Cavaliers a satisfactory offer, then the only realistic option is to head into training camp with Irving still a key member of the team, although Cleveland.com reports that Irving will be moved before the season starts. Irving does, however, have two years remaining on his contract. It isn't completely inconceivable that Irving and James will end up playing together this season, though it would be strange. The process of moving Irving is certainly taking up time that the Cavaliers could use on getting better.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191913"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219910"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "309051", "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317450", "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Free_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "326628", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Free Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "329659", "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "344563", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "348517", "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368317", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bledsoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "717462", "label": {"eng": "Eric Bledsoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragan_Bender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1288854", "label": {"eng": "Dragan Bender"}}]}

The New York Knicks have been caught up in the Irving talk of late after a report circulated that the Cavs have eyes for Knicks phenom Kristaps Porzingis. But according to Steven Marcus and Mike Rose of Newsday, Porzingis' name is off the table in any Irving trade talks:\n\nThe Knicks don't appear interested in trading Kristaps Porzingis, including a possible deal for Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, according to a league source.\n\nESPN reported on Tuesday that the Cavaliers may be preparing for a future without LeBron James and have Porzingis as a \"primary\" target in trade scenarios for Irving. The Cavaliers appear focused on getting back a young star in return for Irving, the report said.\n\n\"[Knicks president] Steve Mills and [Knicks general manager] Scott Perry on the record were very clear that Kristaps was part of the future,'' the source said in reference to comments made last month by both executives. \"In all the discussions since then -- there were other rumors before that Cleveland would want Kristaps -- and it didn't seem that [the Knicks] were interested at all in a conversation.''\n\n...\n\nESPN reported that Porzingis, Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum, Suns rookie Josh Jackson and Nuggets guard Jamal Murray, who averaged 9.9 points per game in his rookie season, are among the players the Cavaliers have interest in.\n\nA spokesperson at ASM Sports, which represents Porzingis, said, \"It's agency policy not to comment on possible trade scenarios.'' Porzingis is in his native Latvia for the European Championship.\n\nPorzingis skipped his exit meeting with the Knicks at the end of the season, but Mills said last month that he and Porzingis had spoken a few times this summer.\n\n\"Kristaps and I have a hectic texting relationship,\" Mills said. \"I continue to text Kristaps over the summer and he and I have spoken two or three times over the summer.\"\n\n* * *\n\nLeBron gets in pickup game with Anthony, Durant -- Summertime is the perfect time for a little pickup basketball, no matter who you are. And in pick-up basketball circles, you go where the best game is at. Those ideas are true even for some of the best players in the NBA, as LeBron James recently flew to New York to get in some run with Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony. Chris Haynes of ESPN.com has more:\n\nCleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James took a private jet from Akron, Ohio, to New York on Tuesday morning to participate in high-profile pickup games that featured Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks and Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors, among others.\n\n...\n\nJames played for approximately two hours, a source said. As soon as the game was over, he hopped on his jet and flew back to Ohio in order to attend his annual LeBron James Family Foundation function at Cedar Point amusement park.\n\n\"He just has a love for basketball,\" a source close to James said, adding that the Cavs star plans to partake in some pickup games in Los Angeles in the near future.\n\nAn incredible run today. One of the best open runs of all time? You decide. #AcademyBasketball#RelentlessPursuitpic.twitter.com/bNeHpgG11r -- Academy Basketball (@__TheAcademy)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\n* * *\n\nKerr a fan of 2017-18 schedule -- The NBA went out of its way to try and lighten the overall burden of the 82-game season when it released the 2017-18 schedule. While no league schedule is ever perfect, this one has been met with overall solid reviews from not only the media but also the coach of the defending NBA champs, Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors. Daniel Mano of The Mercury News has more:\n\nNext season's NBA schedule so delights Steve Kerr that he gave commissioner Adam Silver serious kudos.\n\nThe Warriors head coach praised Silver while on 95.7 The Game's Damon Bruce Show on Monday.\n\n\"That's the beauty of this schedule, is that the league and Adam Silver, they really listened to us,\" Kerr told Bruce. \"They listened to our thoughts and our concerns and our complaints. Obviously adding a week to the calendar of the season helped quite a bit.\n\n\"But I think the league went beyond that and really did a good job of making sure that the schedule just made more sense -- taking the player's health into consideration.\"\n\nGolden State has three fewer back-to-backs this season (from 17 to 14) and will not have a stretch of four games in five nights (one last season, NBA eliminated such stretches this season).\n\n...\n\n\"I have zero complaints about our schedule and I think it's really a tribute to the work that Adam and the league do with the players and the union to try to work together to put together the best possible product for our fans,\" Kerr told Bruce. \"Everything just checks out. ... Nobody in the league has a single stretch of four games in five nights.\"\n\n* * *\n\nReport: Grizzlies to hire Prince for front office job -- During his NBA career, Tayshaun Prince was a defense-first player who could provide a little scoring punch at times, too. His versatility will perhaps come into play as he is reportedly in line for an executive-type role with one of his former teams, the Memphis Grizzlies. Ronald Tillery of The Commercial Appeal has more:\n\nRetired forward Tayshaun Prince will soon be named special assistant to Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace, according to several NBA sources.\n\n...\n\nPrince is widely considered a big influence in NBA locker rooms and operated as a calming voice with Grizzlies players.\n\nThe Grizzlies believe Prince will bring a unique voice to front office decisions.\n\nBefore the 2014-15 season, Prince started 838 regular-season games since the beginning of the 2003-04 season with the Detroit Pistons. That was the second-most in the NBA, behind Cleveland's LeBron James.\n\nPrince always discussed his role as wide-ranging.\n\n\"It's not the minutes you play, it's what you can get done in the time you're out there and the opportunities you have,\" Prince told The Commercial Appeal in 2014. \"Obviously, what I do on the floor, being versatile and defending multiple positions and doing things without scoring, requires minutes. But who knows what the minutes will be? It's just having more of a chance offensively would be the only thing I'd say that would be a different scenario.\"\n\nTeammates echoed Prince's sentiment.\n\n\"He's a good friend and a great locker room guy,\" swingman Tony Allen said. \"He's a class A-1 guy. He knows how things are supposed to be run. He's a champion.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51,

However, the latest on that is that such did not take place and that it may have been nothing more than fake news.\n\nWord of the meeting first came from Tony Rizzo but Stephen A. Smith disputed the claim on ESPN's first take. Hence, the tarnished relationship between James and Irving has technically not gained ground.\n\nPatching things up would have been good news to Cavs fans had it gone down. As it stands, that the Kyrie Irving trade is still on the table though time is fast running out.\n\nThere is a chance that Irving may soften up and play one more season with the Cavs.\n\nThis is assuming no deal is made in the coming weeks and if Irving can co-exist with James.\n\n\"Uncle Drew\" could also pay attention to reports that James and Cavs management have a relationship beyond repair. If true, an imminent separation could be happening next summer according to Chris Sheridan of ESPN.\n\nSo far, no team has come close to signing Irving. San Antonio is standing out as his preferred destination but the Spurs have hardly made any effort to budge.\n\nThere are other teams [VIDEO] being mentioned for \"Uncle Drew\" like the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks. Like the Spurs, they haven't come close as well.\n\nWith the 2017-18 NBA season fast approaching, the chances are high that Irving will stay on for one more season with the Cavs. The meeting with James could have touched on that, both laying a pact to give it one more ride.\n\nAfter that, both can go their separate ways and jump the Cavs bandwagon. James has that option to negotiate with other teams, one of which is reportedly the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nFor Irving, he may find himself in the same situation next summer. If not, he may end up staying in Cleveland - assuming James does leave. The focus is singled out as one reason why the all-star guard wants out. So with LeBron out, he would be once again the focal point.\n\nIf James and Irving team up for one more season, reaching the NBA Finals once more may not be as easy.

Actually, it seems that the rumors have even cooled off to some extent as well. As Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reminded, there are a select few teams which Irving has called his preferred landing spots, including the Minnesota Timberwolves, New York Knicks, Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nEven though Irving doesn't have a no-trade clause and could technically be moved anywhere the Cavaliers wanted, much of the speculation about trades has resulted in him going to one of those four places. There are certainly trade possibilities that would make sense with each of the teams above, but for now, Irving is still LeBron James' teammate in Cleveland.\n\nBut while there haven't been any concrete trade rumors that have picked up much steam, former Spurs great David Robinson has now sounded off on the prospect of Irving joining San Antonio. When recently speaking with SiriusXM NBA Radio, Robinson said the Spurs would be \"crazy not to want a talented guy\" like Irving.\n\nRobinson had quite a bit to say, but a few pieces stood out, one specifically was about how the Cavaliers point guard would fit in San Antonio's system.\n\n\"He's been a force for them,\" Robinson noted. \"You know, with our system -- I can't really speculate on what it would be like with him -- but I certainly think you add a talent like that to a system that can...enhance his impact in the game and make him more efficient.\n\nTime will tell how this all plays out, but realistically, it's hard to envision the Cavaliers wanting to move Irving to another legitimate contender. Even if they are considering the four teams on Irving's list, the Spurs have to be one of the bottom preferences for the team.\n\nBut, as previously stated, the Cavaliers can move him anywhere they'd like.

Rumors have suggested LeBron will end up with the Los Angeles Lakers for the next stage of his career, which means it will be the second time he chooses to depart Cleveland for a new scene.\n\nTerry Pluto of the Cleveland Plain Dealer previously reported the Denver Nuggets would not give up Jamal Murray and Gary Harris in a possible Irving trade.\n\nJames reportedly won't yield his no-trade clause, so Cavaliers' best and only option to avoid a massive fiasco in the short term is to move on from Irving and trade him in exchange for a skillful and talented young core player/s with a number of years under franchise control.\n\nIt's no secret James' frustration with the organisation has been escalating since the Cavaliers were ousted in the NBA Finals and Gilbert opted not to renew general manager David Griffin's contract.\n\nPorzingis skipped his exit meeting with former team president Phil Jackson, and the trade rumors soon followed.\n\nIt's important to note that the Cleveland Cavaliers are not obligated to grant Irving's request since the All-Star point guard is under contract for a minimum of two more seasons. However, the Celtics have a player that the Cavaliers want in Tatum. Still, reports indicate that numerous teams interested in making a deal for Irving will wait until around September to get more serious.\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs and Kyrie Irving have mutual interest in a long-term commitment, according to a new report. It was claimed that the team is not giving up on the chance of re-signing James the next summer if he still wants to stay. With this, it was added that the All-Star player can be a great fit for the team.\n\nSo while the idea for a Kyrie Irving trade to San Antonio is great, it seems like a far-fetched fantasy situation at this point for Spurs fans. In all reality, the Cavs have more than just a season to field plenty of offers.\n\nRelated News: Barnett & Company Inc.

During the first round against Indiana Pacers and the second round against Toronto Raptors, Irving reportedly did not speak to any teammate for days.\n\nKyrie also had several talks with former Cavs GM David Griffin over the past year to address Irving's unhappiness with the Cavaliers. The Cavs had been concerned over Irving's mindset in the past few months, knowing that he has grown unhappy over playing a secondary role, according to ESPN.\n\nIrving had a sit-down talk with Cavs owner Dan Gilbert last month and requested to be traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, San Antonio Spurs, Miami Heat or New York Knicks. No deals are certain yet, as the Cavaliers reportedly wants to get a player who can equal what Irving brings to the team or someone who can be greater than him. As previously reported by The Inquisitr, the Cavs is also hoping they could still work things out with the 25-year-old point guard and have him stay in the camp.\n\nThe only proposed deal that came close to actually happening is that with the Phoenix Suns, although the NBA team was not included in Irving's preference. However, because the Suns did not want to include Josh Jackson, things fell apart, as reported by CBS Sports. There is still hope that the Cavs and the Suns would resume possible trade talks, given that there are only two months left before a new season of NBA begins. But Jackson thinks he would not be part of it. \"I think if that was going to happen, it would have happened by now,\" Jackson told Sirius XM NBA Radio. Jackson ranked No. 4 in the overall picks in the 2017 NBA Draft.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, about 20 teams expressed interest in having Irving. However, the real struggle comes in terms of the amount of risk they are willing to give up in exchange for Irving. Trading for the all-star point guard would involve a combination of assets. At this stage, it is possible that Kyrie Irving will still be with the Cavs when the new season begins.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307948", "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "317450", "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322747", "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323676", "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323679", "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348523", "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM_Holdings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270561", "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM Holdings"}}]}

It would be tough to see the move putting the Spurs past the Golden State Warriors though, whose lineup is nearly unstoppable.\n\nWhile Irving likely would want to commit to the team if he were traded to them, Cleveland likely won't trade him to the Spurs. Cleveland will likely lose LeBron James to LA after this coming season. Cleveland needs a future, and all the Spurs have to offer is older players. The franchise has even reportedly confirmed that they want young talent, and that is something that the old Spurs don't have in abundance.\n\nIf Irving does head to the Spurs, he likely won't be heading back to the NBA Finals anytime soon. The Western Conference is stacked with formidable contenders. The Golden State Warriors especially may be one of the most talented teams of all time, and will likely remain that way for at least the next two or three years.\n\nIt is unclear where Irving will end up.

Despite interest, Irving remains in Cleveland, and speculation over his future has reportedly impacted the long-term future of LeBron James.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reports that as the team considers their short and long-term options, they do so with the assumption that James may not be apart of it.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, \"Cleveland isn't giving up on the possibility of re-signing James next summer, but it is no longer investing blind faith in the hope he will stay.\" This makes sense; teams should consider every option, even if they feel confident their star player is committed. But with Cleveland, it's trickier.\n\nThe front office wants a commitment from James before going forward with a plan to build around him. James on the other hand, wants to see what Cleveland does before committing:\n\nCleveland's case for commitment is this: We've had the highest payroll in the NBA, run luxury tax bills north of $75 million since James' return. Trust our commitment to winning.\n\nJames' case for hesitancy is this: Accomplished GM David Griffin is gone, replaced with Altman, a young, unproven executive.\n\nAnd because the team won a title in 2016, both sides have leverage. Ownership doesn't want to commit to expensive veterans on long-term deals if James leaves after next season. James doesn't want to commit long-term until he sees what the new general manager can do.\n\nThe impasse has affected trade deliberations with Irving. Woj writes the team's preference is to get a young star in return that would help this season but also long-term. A trade involving star veterans isn't on the cards unless James is. That makes it unlikely the team would negotiate with the San Antonio Spurs at this point, which as Wojnarowski suggests, would be an ideal situation for all parties.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boston Celtics could offer short and long-term assets, but no discussions have been made at this point. Cleveland has interest in New York Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis, but so far New York has rejected any discussions involving him. The Milwaukee Bucks have expressed interest in Irving, but since Giannis Antetokounmpo is off the table, they can't offer the kind of return Cleveland seeks.\n\nCleveland expected a lot of interest for Irving when the news broke, but that hasn't happened:\n\nWhen Irving's trade request became public in mid-July, there was internal hope that the news would stir the market to furnish Cleveland with a return that could deliver impact to the 2017-18 season with James, as well as the possibility of a future without him. That hasn't happened, and it's become clear that Irving isn't commanding that kind of robust return on the market.\n\nWojnarowski expects trade talks to pick up in September before training camp starts.\n\nAll that said, Cleveland is in a tough spot. Porzingis is one of the league's emerging stars, but it according to Woj they would likely have to take on Joakim Noah's massive three-year, $55 million contract. If they want to avoid taking on bad long-term contracts, that could be a sticking point.\n\nThere's also the likelihood of whether New York would even part with Porzingis. Phil Jackson is gone, and new general manager Scott Perry is preaching patience rather than shaking things up with a trade involving Porzingis or Carmelo Anthony.\n\nIf Cleveland can't sway New York to part with Porzingis, their options are limited.

It wasn't exactly an endorsement akin to the letter he wrote three years ago, but any word from James's camp confirming his commitment to the Cavaliers for 2017-18 was certainly better than nothing.\n\nThree weeks later, it appears Cleveland has come to the realization the rest of the basketball world made long ago: There's no guarantee James will be wearing wine and gold beyond this season. According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Cavaliers are engaging in trade talks on Irving under the assumption that James will spurn them in free agency for a second time.\n\nHowever, that plan of attack doesn't mean owner Dan Gilbert and new general manager Koby Altman have given up on the possibility of re-signing the four-time MVP next July. Instead, Wojnarowski reports, Cleveland will seek a trade package for Irving revolving around \"an elite young player\" rather than win-now veterans who could more ably assist James in winning his fourth Larry O'Brien Trophy.\n\nEvery team faced with the unfortunate task of trading a superstar initially wants players in return who fill that gaping void in both the present and the long-term future. The nuance that separates those discussions from others is which timeline the team hopes to address first.\n\nThe prevailing notion was that the Cavaliers would only move Irving in a deal that kept them a clear cut above other contenders fighting to dethrone the Golden State Warriors. A rumored trade that would send Irving to the Los Angeles Clippers for DeAndre Jordan and Patrick Beverley represents that type of yield, while another popular proposal involving the Phoenix Suns' Eric Bledsoe and Josh Jackson would likely appeal to Cleveland regardless of James' status.\n\nIt's now safe to assume an Irving trade that could leave the Cavaliers without the opportunity for upward mobility in the event James bolts is no longer on the table. Wojnarowski notes that the New York Knicks' Kristaps Porzingis is a \"primary\" target for Cleveland, and the team reportedly has interest in other high-upside youngsters including Jackson, the Boston Celtics' Jayson Tatum, and the Denver Nuggets' Jamal Murray.\n\nPorzingis is the only player among that group who could potentially be ready for the NBA Finals stage in June while softening the blow of James leaving weeks later, which is why the Knicks are so reluctant to part with him amid apparent disharmony of their own. Young stars breathing similarly rarefied air -- Giannis Antetkoumpo, Karl-Anthony Towns and Nikola Jokic -- are essentially untouchable. There's a clear drop-off to the next tier of youngsters boasting foundational talent. Myles Turner, Andrew Wiggins and Devin Booker, for instance, probably aren't good enough to give the Cavaliers a puncher's chance against the Warriors. They appear to have ceilings as run-of-the-mill All-Stars, not transcendent ones.\n\nAP Photo/Phil Long\n\nCleveland's asking price for Irving, then, might be unrealistic. Teams won't sacrifice the far-reaching luxury of an obvious superstar for the opportunity to pay Irving upwards of $30 million a year when his player option arises after 2018-19. The Minnesota Timberwolves are still refusing to make Wiggins available, and the same goes for Phoenix with Booker. If those guys can't be had in an Irving trade, does the kind of player the Cavaliers want really exist on the trade market? All momentum suggests that's unlikely, which means Cleveland's reported intention to focus on the future could ensure the team begins it with James playing elsewhere.\n\nThat's a worst-case scenario, obviously, but one the Cavaliers are reportedly allowing to become possible. Not seeking trade returns that simultaneously address James this season and the possibility he leaves in free agency leave the door open to disaster. Few teams each season have legitimate championship aspirations, and James is basically one unto himself - with or without Irving. The Warriors change the equation for their competitors, though. Like it or not, it's safe to assume that injury is the only development that will keep Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and company from repeating as champions.\n\nIf that's the circumstance guiding Cleveland here, it makes some sense. Why sacrifice the achievement of drafting and developing Irving only to trade him for players who won't be able to keep the franchise afloat in his absence, especially if a second title in three years hinges on an awkward landing or flailing elbow?\n\nThe answer: Because those things happen, and so do other events outside the realm of the Cavaliers' control. Have they forgotten the suspension that propelled them to history in 2016?\n\nThere is no easy answer here. Gilbert can't undo his mistake of letting David Griffin walk when Cleveland was on the verge of swinging a blockbuster deal for Paul George. But after trading Irving, Cleveland will still have an outside chance of winning a championship simply by virtue of James playing one more year in his hometown. Why not maximize it by bringing in players who have the chops to play in June, then pick up the pieces from there if the Cavaliers' worst fears come true in free agency?\n\nIt's not as though Altman would be bereft of trade assets. Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson have value, and the 2019 first-round pick Cleveland owes to the Atlanta Hawks will only be conveyed if it falls outside the top 10. The Cavaliers wouldn't be going anywhere without James anyway; tanking to get the individual talent an Irving trade seemingly won't muster would probably be their best path forward.\n\nCleveland, though, is apparently intent on going a different direction - one that's likely to make this coming season not only fruitless, but the last one James plays at home in Ohio.\n\nMore NBA Coverage

However, James could ultimately play a major role in Irving's final destination, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nNBA TRADE RUMORS: Cavs targeting Kristaps Porzingis?\n\nWhen he informed Cleveland's front office of his desire to be dealt, Irving also reportedly submitted the Cavs' brass with a list of four preferred landing sports -- the Timberwolves, Heat, Spurs and Knicks. Obviously, a move to San Antonio (61-21 last season), where he'd play under coach Gregg Popovich and alongside two-time Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard, would (at least on paper) give Irving the best chance to contend for a title against next season. Irving also makes sense for the Spurs' future, as he is willing to commit to a long-term extension beyond the two years remaining on his current contract.\n\nBut if James, who becomes an unrestricted free agent next summer, continues to hold a non-committal stance with the Cavs beyond 2017-18, any potential deal with the Spurs could be off.\n\nAs Wojnarowski noted, the Spurs have pieces like Tony Parker, LaMarcus Aldridge and Danny Green to keep the Cavs, owners of the NBA's most expensive payroll, in pursuit of another trip to the NBA Finals amid an Eastern Conference that will feature a Celtics squad bolstered by the addition of Gordon Hayward. But staying in win-now mode presents a problem if James feels he is better off spending the rest of his career outside of the state of Ohio, and a trade with San Antonio could leave Cleveland stuck with pricey veterans and no building blocks for the future. As it stands, Cleveland must put its effort into pursuing trade partners that could offer a young star such as Knicks big man Kristaps Porzingis or Suns rookie Josh Jackson in the event James takes his talents elsewhere when his contract expires.\n\nAs much as he wants to strike out on his own, Irving, like the rest of the Cavs organization, is at the King's mercy.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219910"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329076", "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329078", "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Defensive_Player_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "339133", "label": {"eng": "NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "392642", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}]}

According to ESPN, that desire has to do with a fear that LeBron James is preparing to leave again.\n\nOf course, Cavaliers officials prefer to re-sign James to a long-term deal and chase titles together into his twilight, but the Cavs are treating his unwillingness to commit as a call to protect themselves long term in the Irving trade, league sources said.\n\nCleveland has reportedly received interest for Irving from teams like the Bucks, Suns, and Spurs but their insistence on youth has made progress on talks difficult. The players they're asking for are young potential stars teams are hesitant give up. Especially when Irving is expected to test free agency in 2019.\n\nThe Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\n\nMilwaukee has shown interest in Irving, too, league sources said, but there isn't that one young star -- of course, Giannis Antetokounmpo is untouchable -- who makes sense for Cleveland.\n\nPorzingis and Antetokounmpo are considered future stars and it's going to take more than Irving for New York and Milwaukee to move them.

According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the Cavaliers are hopeful that James will sign a contract extension with the team amid rumors that he plans to bolt Cleveland in 2018 and join the Los Angeles Lakers. However, the Cavaliers are also anticipating that James might leave the team after this season. With that, Wojnarowski said the Cavaliers are looking to get young assets from the Irving trade that could give them some building blocks for the future if James leaves the team for the second time.\n\nIn 2010, the Cavaliers allowed James to leave via free agency without getting anything in return.\n\nJames has a $35.6 million player option next summer in his deal with the Cavaliers after this season. While he plans to stick with the Cavaliers this coming season, James did not directly express his intention to stay with the team beyond that. Irving, for his part, demanded a trade from the Cavaliers, saying he wants to be the No. 1 guy rather than play second fiddle to James. Irving mentioned the New York Knicks, San Antonio Spurs, Minnesota Timberwolves and Miami Heat as his preferred landing spots.\n\nThe Cavaliers reportedly want a win-now veteran, a blue-chip young player, and a top draft pick for Irving. According to Wojnarowski, the Cavaliers are interested in New York Knicks big man Kristaps Porzingis, Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum, Phoenix Suns wing Josh Jackson, and Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray.\n\nThe Suns earlier offered Eric Bledsoe, TJ Warren, and Brandon Knight to the Cavaliers for Irving, but the latter turned it down, insisting that they want either Jackson or shooting guard Devin Booker in the mix. However, the Suns said Jackson and Booker are both untouchables. Phoenix then made a solid offer of Bledsoe, young big man Dragan Bender, and a 2018 first-round pick for Irving but the Cavs' seem uninterested.\n\nRumors are swirling that James plans to leave the Cavaliers and join the Lakers in 2018, forming a super team with Paul George of the Oklahoma City Thunder and young players Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram. The rumors were fueled further by Bleacher Report's Kevin Ding, who said that LeBron's wife would prefer to live in Los Angeles full time.

This isn't surprising considering that Irving is one of the best players in the league. He is also only 25, which means that he could be a franchise player for whichever team he ends up joining.\n\nNBA reports indicate that 20 teams have inquired about the point guard, and it seems that everyone would love to acquire him. #Toronto Raptors, who have been #Cleveland Cavaliers' rivals in the East in the recent years, have joined Kyrie Irving sweepstakes. Considering they have a good team that is competitive in the conference, they may have a good chance of trading for the superstar guard.\n\nToronto Raptors general manager Bobby Webster revealed that the team has discussed a possible trade for Kyrie Irving. He also said that the Raptors called the Cleveland Cavaliers regarding the potential trade.\n\n\"We all do our due diligence,\" Webster said in an interview on TSN 1050. \"Things don't always make sense, but if they do, we're always prepared. A lot of talk that we do doesn't really see the light of day.\n\nWhen a player like that becomes available, you'd be remiss not to call.\"\n\nEven though the Raptors inquired about Kyrie Irving, it is not very likely they will be able to land him. While they are a great team that would certainly become much better with Irving, they do not have the assets to make the trade. Furthermore, they gave Kyle Lowry a three-year, $100 million contract extension this summer, which means they want Lowry to stay.\n\nIt may not be the Toronto Raptors, but it has become obvious that Kyrie Irving will leave the Cavaliers for another team. Irving is simply not happy in Cleveland and he even considered asking for a trade after the Cavaliers won it all in 2016.\n\nIf Irving was unhappy with the situation after winning a championship, there is no doubt that another loss in the NBA Finals made the situation even worse. There will be a lot more teams that will inquire about the superstar point guard and at the end, the Cavaliers will end up trading him.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304130", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323679", "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHUM_(AM)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "846928", "label": {"eng": "CHUM (AM)"}}]}

We can only dream about good stuff like that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Irving would certainly be godsend to the perennial contenders Spurs, especially with their 35-year-old facilitator Tony Parker entering the twilight of his career and coming off a major surgery.\n\nHowever, earlier reports have indicated that the Cavs are looking for \"young assets\" in possible trade scenarios, which the Spurs presumably lack at the moment.

The Cleveland Cavaliers were reportedly wanting a \"young star\" in return for #Kyrie Irving. According to a piece written by Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the team is looking in a direction of a future without LeBron James. Reports have been circulating that James is considering leaving next season.\n\nThe Cavaliers had four players in mind that they would want if they parted with Irving. These included Kristaps Porzingis, Josh Jackson, Jayson Tatum, and Jamal Murray. Wojnarowski identified that Porzingis is the Cavaliers main target, but that the trade is unrealistic.\n\nThe Knicks have been wanting to move Carmelo Anthony, and build around Porzingis. That means that the Knicks are out because no trade will happen with Cleveland unless Porzingis is included. Anthony will not waive his no trade clause for Cleveland anymore.\n\nIf Porzingis is truly off the table, then the Cavaliers need to look in a new direction if they are going to trade Irving. The Cavaliers realistically do not want to trade Irving to their conference rival, #Boston Celtics. However, the Celtics have a player that the Cavaliers want in Tatum. Plus, the Celtics have the draft picks [VIDEO] to make a package. Irving has two years left on his deal and is getting paid $18 million, so the Celtics would have to find a way to dump salary.\n\nBoston [VIDEO] seems like the most realistic trade partner at this point.\n\nThe Nuggets have no reason to part with Murray as just completed his rookie campaign, and Irving would not likely resign with Denver. The Suns do not want to part with Jackson or Devin Booker. That leaves Boston.\n\nBoston would have difficulty moving salaries. It would likely mean that Jae Crowder and Marcus Smart. Both of their salaries combine for about $10.5 million. Combine Tatum into the mix with his $5.6 million, and you might have a deal. Irving would give the Celtics a backup plan as well if Isaiah Thomas refuses to resign. The Celtics would be a dangerous team in the league with a starting rotation that features Irving, Thomas, Gordon Hayward, and Al Horford.\n\nThe Cavaliers will not have a shot after this year to win a title if James leaves. It's that simple. If the team knows that he is going to leave, then they might as well keep Irving and make one last run at a title before the team blows up in front of them. No matter what young star they receive, he will not be James. The Cavaliers have won just one title in their long standing history.

According to Tony Rizzo of ESPN, very reliable sources told him that James and Irving went face to face over the weekend in Florida. However, Rizzo said he wasn't sure if there was a thawing out process. Rizzo's sources also said the two did not get into any heated discussion. \"As for what they talked about or discussed...it was very cool,\" said Rizzo.\n\nHowever, Stephen A. Smith disputed Rizzo's claim, saying James and Irving did not meet in Miami to discuss their situation.\n\nSmith earlier claimed that James would be \"tempted to beat Irving's ass if he saw him right now.\" On his Twitter account, James denied Smith's pronouncement, urging people to get another source.\n\nIrving's camp, for its part, believes that it was James who leaked to the media their trade demand, which he issued during his meeting with Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. During that meeting, Irving enumerated his preferred destinations, which include the New York Knicks, San Antonio Spurs, Minnesota Timberwolves and the Miami Heat. The Cavaliers, for their part, want a win-now veteran, a blue-chip young gun and a top draft pick for Irving.\n\nIf they iron out their differences, the duo will have one last run to win a championship as a tandem as James is 100 percent sure to leave the Cavaliers in 2018.\n\nAccording to long-time NBA writer Chris Sheridan, the relationship between James and Gilbert is beyond irreparable and he's 100 percent leaving Cleveland in 2018. However, Sheridan's claim was contradicted by Sam Amico of Fox Sports Ohio and Chris Broussard of Fox Sports 1. Amico said Sheridan's source \"swung and missed by a mile.\" Broussard, for his part, reported that James will reveal his plan for the future after this season.\n\nWith James' future still uncertain, the Cavaliers cannot fulfill Irving's trade request immediately [VIDEO]. If James decides to leave Cleveland, the Cavaliers may seek for young players who they can use as building blocks. It was reported that James might bolt Cleveland for the second time in his career and join young guns Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. Paul George of the Oklahoma City Thunder might also join the Lakers in 2018 and form a super team with James.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges_and_Universities", "wgt": 100, "id": 143, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Colleges and Universities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181655"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "type": "loc", "id": "182034"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305549", "label": {"eng": "Blue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305633", "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322747", "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "337439", "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Broussard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "385930", "label": {"eng": "Chris Broussard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "389722", "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

With the training camps beginning next month teams are finalizing the last puzzle pieces in their rosters. But that does not hold true for the Cleveland Cavaliers as they are still trying their best to find a great deal for Kyrie Irving. Here are a few updates on the NBA free agency scene:\n\nWith the recent events that have struck the Cleveland Cavaliers, from Dan Gilbert leaving to Kyrie Irving requesting a trade, it seems like the Cavaliers have been silent and limited about their offseason moves in the hopes of beating the Warriors next season.\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski of NBA ESPN has reported that they are looking at #Kristaps Porzingis as their main target in return for all-star guard Kyrie Irving. A few days ago the Cavs strictly made open their demands by asking for a veteran starter, draft picks, and a solid young prospect. The offers they have received from other teams are far from what they want as teams are hesitant about giving up so much to a Kyrie Irving who will not commit #Long Term.\n\nIf the Cleveland Cavaliers do hit the jackpot this offseason and land Kristaps Porzingis this could be very good news for the Cavs and might even tempt LeBron James to stay next offseason. Porzingis has been amazing so far in his first two seasons in the NBA, he has averaged 16.1 points, 1.9 blocks, 0.7 steals, 1.4 assists, and 7.2 rebounds while shooting 43.6 percent from the field and 34.6 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nThe limited trade offers the Cavaliers have received from other teams is mainly because of reports surrounding Kyrie [VIDEO] that he is unwilling to commit long term to wherever he will be traded this offseason. This made teams reluctant to sacrifice so much for an all-star player who is likely to stay for only two seasons. However, Adrian Wojnarowski of NBA ESPN has reported that Kyrie Irving is interested in committing long term only to the #San Antonio Spurs at the moment.\n\nThis is great news for Spurs fan as San Antonio is very interested in Kyrie. The only problem they face is they have limited assets to trade and no young prospect to give up.

While most figured the Cavs would be looking to capitalize on what is left of LeBron James' time in Cleveland, it appears as though the fear of losing him again is making the Cavs look at younger options.\n\nAccording to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the team is not putting blind hope into James staying anymore. Rather than be reactive to departure, they are looking to set themselves up in position to succeed in the future, with or without James:\n\nThe Cavs aren't giving up on the possibility of re-signing James next summer, but they are no longer investing blind faith in the hope he will stay. For James, a reluctance to commit comes with an emerging set of complications. Beyond Irving's decision to ask for a trade, Cleveland has determined that it's unwilling to simply be reactive to James' possible departure.\n\nOf course, Cavaliers officials prefer to re-sign James to a long-term deal and chase titles together into his twilight, but the Cavs are treating his unwillingness to commit as a call to protect themselves long term in the Irving trade, league sources said.\n\nSo what does this mean from a Cavs perspective? Well the list of players the team has reportedly inquired on is as follows:\n\nThe Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\n\nThose names all make sense with the exception of Jayson Tatum. While he looks to be a talented scorer, he is still the top four pick from this year's draft with the most questions and bust potential. In addition to that, the Cavs would be sending Irving to their rival in the Boston Celtics and giving them what they need to beat the Cavs and make the Finals. I just can't see a deal between Cleveland and Boston taking place.\n\nThe primary target for the Cavs has been Kristaps Porzingis, however the willingness to take back Joakim Noah has been a sticking point in the talks:\n\nPorzingis has emerged as a primary Cleveland target, but that's a conversation that can occur only with Cleveland's willingness to unburden the Knicks of the three years and $55 million left on Joakim Noah's contract. For now, the conversation is a nonstarter for the Knicks, league sources said.\n\nA straight up trade of Irving for Porzingis and Noah does work from a salary cap standpoint. With the Cavs not having many inciting options to pair with Irving, taking the worst contract in the league off the Knicks hands may be the best way to close the gap in value. It also would once again show Dan Gilbert's willingness to spend, something that could help rebuild some faith from LeBron. Noah, though, is effectively dead weight. There's no reason to believe he'd be able to contribute over the length of that contract.\n\nRegardless of whether or not James has given the Cavs any indications of what his plans are, I think this is the correct approach. James has every right to not commit moving forward, but the natural consequence is that the Cavs need to look after their own interests. If they can find a deal that balances the return so that it helps both now in the future, then I think we see the team move on the deal and trade Irving.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "339167", "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

But thanks to Kyrie Irving and his recent reported trade demand, the rumor mill is still churning.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski recently provided new details on the chase for Irving, offering clues about players and packages the Cleveland Cavaliers might be interested in.\n\nElsewhere, reports of the New York Knicks' Kristaps Porzingis being off the table have surfaced. And all the while, the Phoenix Suns seem to be in play.\n\nWhat are the Cavaliers Looking For in an Irving Trade?\n\nIn a report from ESPN.com's Wojnarowski, several young players from around the league were listed as possible targets for the Cavs:\n\n\"The process of building out the franchise's roster long term has accelerated with Irving's trade request. The Cavaliers have witnessed James' exit strategy twice -- once to leave Cleveland and once to return -- and the Irving trade request has left them unwilling to squander the opportunity to replenish young assets on a roster that could be crippled in a post-James Cavaliers era that is stocked with high-priced veterans.\n\n\"The Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\"\n\nCleveland wanting to avoid rock bottom for the second time in one decade is understandable. When LeBron James left in 2010, the team was left in shambles. It went 97-215 (.311) during LeBron's four years in Miami.\n\nIrving, of course, would be a solid centerpiece for a post-LeBron organizational strategy. But him beating James out the door could actually help the Cavs survive this potential departure from LeBron far better than they did previously.\n\nTatum and Jackson are as unproved (maybe even more so) than Irving was during 2011-12. Porzingis and Murray, though, have shown a little bit of what they can do at the NBA level.\n\nPorzingis would be the biggest get for Cleveland, but, as will be detailed later, he's probably not available. That leaves Murray, a 20-year old whose rookie-season Box Plus-Minus was better than Devin Booker's, per Basketball Reference.\n\nMurray's first year in the league didn't show as much as Irving's, but there are certainly hints of the latter's game in him. And if he came along with another good player and some picks, this could actually be a win for the Cavs.\n\nAs much as Cleveland might like getting a 7'3\" player who's 22 years old and loaded with guard skills, it looks like the Knicks are wisely keeping him out of trade discussions.\n\n\"The Knicks don't appear interested in trading Kristaps Porzingis, including a possible deal for Cavaliers All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, according to a league source,\"Steven Marcus and Mike Rose of Newsday wrote.\n\nAgain, this is probably the right course of action for New York. No player in NBA history can match Porzingis' totals for career threes (193) and blocks (263) through two seasons, per Basketball Reference.\n\nEven if you drop the qualifiers down to 150 for both blocks and threes, the list only includes Porzingis, Shane Battier, Eddie Griffin and Rudy Gay. All three of those other players are at least five inches shorter than Porzingis.\n\nHe could very well be the embodiment of the NBA's next positional revolution, a center who can legitimately do everything on the floor. He'll have competition for that mantle, of course. Nikola Jokic and Karl-Anthony Towns are further down the path. But Porzingis has the edge on both in terms of size and athleticism.\n\nAs noted by Wojnarowski, one of the players the Cavs may be looking at in potential Irving trades is Suns rookie Josh Jackson. But it looks like him, and possibly Devin Booker, would be tough to land.\n\n\"League sources continue to label the Suns as the team with the right assets to obtain Irving,\" Basketball Insiders' Steve Kyler wrote. \"But they remain reluctant to include rookie Josh Jackson or third-year stud Devin Booker in any conversation. Jackson became trade eligible last week and recently joked at the Panini rookie photo shoot that he'd heard the rumors, but if it were going to happen, it would have happened by now.\"\n\nAdvanced numbers aren't a fan of Booker, who finished 168th out of 194 qualified players in Box Plus-Minus last season, per Basketball Reference. He struggles to provide much value beyond scoring at this point in his career, and he's not terribly efficient there.\n\nBut his 70-point game is tantalizing. Even if his whole team was helping him hunt shots in that second half, that's an insane output for a 20-year old. In fact, he was the youngest player since 1963 to hit or exceed 70 points in a game by over three years, per Basketball Reference. It also yielded the highest individual Game Score of the 2016-17 season, again, per Basketball Reference.\n\nA one-game sample size is minuscule. But Phoenix's hesitance to include Booker in a deal for Irving is understandable. Jackson, on the other hand, is tougher to figure out.\n\nIrving is still just 25 years old. He's one of 12 players in NBA history to register at least 8,000 points, 2,000 assists and 500 threes through his first six seasons, per Basketball Reference. And he's already a proven option as a scorer at the game's highest level.\n\nIn 13 Finals games, Irving has averaged 27.7 points, 4.2 assists and 4.2 rebounds, while shooting 46.8 percent from the field and 39.5 percent from three.\n\nJackson may be loaded with two-way potential.

This leads me to believe that the New York Knicks are not the right fit for Kyrie Irving.\n\nIn late July, Pablo Torre of ESPN reported that Kyrie Irving wanted \"badly\" to join the Ne York Knickerbockers. In typical New York fashion, our passionate fans lept to Twitter and social media posting pictures of the NBA All-Star guard in a Knicks uniform. While this flashy move may keep the Knicks relevant and improve their win total from last season, it's not the right move.\n\nIn order to truly service a talent like Irving, New York needs the proper management, culture and coaching in place to win at a high level. Yet, if the last 10 years have taught fans anything, it's that this club's front office and coaching positions have been a perpetual revolving door.\n\nI'm not saying the Knicks shouldn't go after the fantastically-finishing point guard. Rather, my point is that a player like Kyrie (a great offensive threat and a better playmaker than he gets credit for), needs complimentary players, strong coaching and a team where he is not expected to be the savior.\n\nBasically, I'm referring to a team like the San Antonio Spurs. Let's review why Knicks cannot suit Kyrie Irving's needs, short-term or long-term.\n\nSince 2003, Knicks fans have generally been despondent with the Knicks front office and with good reason. The world's most famous arena has seen the following names come and go, Isiah Thomas, Donnie Walsh, Glen Grunwald, Steve Mills and, most recently, Phil Jackson.\n\nMills, who was kept as general manager during the Phil years, is currently running the Knicks and has employed Scott Perry to his former position. Mills's first several months on the job have been satisfactory with some controversy regarding the Tim Hardaway Jr. and Ron Baker contracts.\n\nMills has talked often about a culture change, but does he have a track record of dealing with star players? More importantly, how will Mills react when said star player is upset? The Carmelo Anthony situation is Mills's first major obstacle and may set a precedent for future deals and interactions down the line.\n\nFurthermore, a more established front office, generally one that has good relationships with agents, is able to surround a star player with other complimentary players that compensate for their weaknesses. With the exception of one season 2012-13, did the Knicks prove they could do that with Melo? Kyrie should be watching closely, because the Big Apple may be too much of a challenge if his immediate motivation is winning.\n\nJeff Hornacek enters his second season with the Knicks amidst many questions and concerns. Hornacek's ability to instill a serviceable defensive system will be closely monitored. In defense of Hornacek, Joakim Noah was hurt and proved to be far removed from the player he was during his Chicago days. Additionally, both Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose did not do much to help on the defensive end.\n\nHowever, Irving is also not known as a defensive stalwart.\n\nIf not paired with a strong defensive two guard, it will be very difficult for Knicks fans to watch him guard opposing point guards in pick and rolls. Despite early reports of a solid defensive reputation for Frank Ntilikina, any deal that concludes with Irving coming to New York will most likely send the young international prospect to Cleveland.\n\nHornacek has also not proved adept at managing stars and getting them to buy into his system. His time in Phoenix ended with a very public falling out with Markieff Morris and also struggled to improve on 48-win team with better talent.\n\nVia Dave King of SB Nation:\n\n\"Basically, the problem was that once the players, like Morris brothers and Goran Dragic and Isaiah Thomas, started thinking for themselves, Hornacek couldn't rein them back in and actually might have tuned them out.\"\n\nWith the Knicks, Hornacek also had difficulty with both Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose. Rose, was famously M.I.A during a home game against the Pelicans, and a report from Ian Begley of ESPN chronicled a half-time shouting match between Anthony and Hornacek.\n\nVia Begley:\n\n\"Hornacek lit into the Knicks in the visitor's locker room of the Barclays Center, and according to people familiar with the matter, Hornacek's diatribe was expletive-filled and delivered at a high decibel level.\"\n\nMelo responded questioning the direction of the franchise, creating a very awkward moment for the team.\n\nFor the reasons mentioned in this article among others, Kyrie Irving does not fit the New York Knicks short-term or long term plans. There is not enough stability within the front office or credibility to put together a consistent winning basketball team. Furthermore, without a seasoned coach with more clout and ability to command respect, big name players like Irving with have too much freedom on the team.\n\nHornacek could be a good coach for the Knicks, but he is currently more suited to work with young players on a team rebuilding for the future. Certainly, the Knicks will need to do more to bolster their roster before the start of the 2017-18 season, yet looking the other way when it comes to Kyrie Irving may be the best option.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "311536", "label": {"eng": "Decibel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316231", "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329077", "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "331120", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "345909", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367654", "label": {"eng": "Derrick Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joakim_Noah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367655", "label": {"eng": "Joakim Noah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hornacek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "374674", "label": {"eng": "Jeff Hornacek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_All-Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "381417", "label": {"eng": "List of NBA All-Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "384776", "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Dragi\u0107", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "445047", "label": {"eng": "Goran Dragi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "489035", "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway,_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "507264", "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway, Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markieff_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "566411", "label": {"eng": "Markieff Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isiah_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "611839", "label": {"eng": "Isiah Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "923459", "label": {"eng": "Donnie Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Grunwald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1003618", "label": {"eng": "Glen Grunwald"}}]}

But according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, one team is willing to pull the trigger on a deal knowing the All-Star point guard would re-sign long-term: the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe Spurs have interest in Irving, league sources say, and Irving's willingness to commit to an extension with the Spurs makes for legitimate win-now deal possibilities for Cleveland.\n\nIrving approached Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert for a trade in July; he no longer wanted to play alongside LeBron James and gave ownership a list of five teams he would like to play for. That list included San Antonio.\n\nCleveland, with new general manager Koby Altman in tow, has not been in a rush to move the All-Star guard who has been a linchpin in the franchise's three straight NBA Finals appearances and lone championship in 2016. Irving does not hold a no-trade clause and cannot dictate his new team even if Cleveland wants to keep him.\n\nIf Kawhi Leonard proved anything in his MVP-level outing last season, it's that he's nearly capable of doing it on his own. Leonard is a one-man band, strapping up the opposing team's best player on one end and carrying the Spurs offense on the other.\n\nBut the Spurs were a shell of themselves in high-leverage situations with their all-world forward off the floor.\n\nAfter Leonard left Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals with an ankle injury, San Antonio blew a 23-point lead and ceded defeat to Golden State. The Warriors eventually swept the Spurs and won a championship in the most dominant postseason display in NBA history.\n\nIf Kawhi had some help at the point guard position, however, the outcome of that West series may have been different. Tony Parker ruptured his quad in San Antonio's second-round series against the Rockets. The Spurs played point guard by committee, with Leonard serving as the primary ball handler and Jonathon Simmons, Patty Mills, and Dejounte Murray filling in.\n\nParker is 35 and isn't on schedule to return until December or January; we don't know what limitations he may have. Mills is the prototypical backup point guard, and Murray, while promising, is years away from being a starter.\n\nAdding Irving to the mix would alleviate the offensive load Leonard's had to carry. More importantly, it would add a star Leonard's age to the Spurs, keeping them competitive under basketball's brightest head coach for years to come.\n\nJust imagine Gregg Popovich with both Irving and Leonard at his disposal.\n\nIrving reportedly wants to be \"the man,\" and he might share that role with Leonard -- in a basketball sense -- in San Antonio. But for his marketability, San Antonio could be the best possible outcome.\n\nKawhi does all his business on the court. Off the court, as Penny Hardaway recently noted, he doesn't care.\n\nYou know what, I couldn't give Kawhi superstar because he's just not a guy who likes commercials. He's not a guy who wants to be the face of the league. He just wants to get his work done.\n\nIrving, whose signature shoe sold second-most among NBA players behind LeBron, would immediately join a championship contender on national television nearly as often as Cleveland. He would add flare and flash to an ostensibly dull San Antonio franchise and give them a young, talented point guard to go toe to toe with the Russell Westbrooks, Stephen Currys, and Chris Pauls of the Western Conference.\n\nThere's no path for a straight-up deal that sends Irving to the Spurs without a third team. San Antonio doesn't have the combination of young prospects and win-now veterans that the Cavaliers desire in a deal, and Cleveland certainly won't take LaMarcus Aldridge back in that trade.\n\nThe Spurs would need to rope in a third team -- one interested in taking Aldridge -- that would be willing to part ways with pieces of its youthful core. Those teams are few and far between, especially if that team isn't getting Irving for its troubles.\n\nAt this point, it's a toss up whether Irving returns to Cleveland this year or makes his season debut for another team.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199248"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307687", "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307688", "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "316235", "label": {"eng": "Patty Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319893", "label": {"eng": "Tony Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329078", "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334399", "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currys", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "441709", "label": {"eng": "Currys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Hardaway", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "746016", "label": {"eng": "Penny Hardaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathon_Simmons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1291380", "label": {"eng": "Jonathon Simmons"}}]}

The team is dealing with the pending free agency of LeBron James in less than 12 months and, in short, everything that the franchise does between now and July 1, 2018 will be through James-colored glasses. That also extends to any trade negotiations involving Irving and, at least theoretically, limits options that the team could execute.\n\nHowever, the San Antonio Spurs could have a particularly useful leg up in the negotiations when compared to other teams, as Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN brings word that Irving would be willing to sign a long-term extension in San Antonio if Cleveland sends him away in a deal.\n\nIf the Cavaliers knew they had James committed, for example, San Antonio could emerge as a more intriguing trade partner. The Spurs have interest in Irving, league sources say, and Irving's willingness to commit to an extension with the Spurs makes for legitimate win-now deal possibilities for Cleveland. Without James beyond next season, though, the likes of LaMarcus Aldridge, Tony Parker and Danny Green hold no appeal.\n\nAs the report notes, it would be ideal for the Cavs to know that James was going to stick around, simply because they could focus more on the future with no real fear of being left in an ugly position for the not-too-distant future. That is of particular note to the Spurs not only because of extension talks, but also because San Antonio is not blessed with a top-end young asset (aside from the untradeable Kawhi Leonard) that would entice Cleveland.\n\nThat, of course, is a similar issue that would plague both the Cavs and Irving's suitors across the league.

And he thinks one of the NBA's best players would fit in well with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThat player would be Cleveland Cavaliers superstar point guard Kyrie Irving, who reportedly has requested a trade. The Spurs were one of the four teams on his reported list of preferred trade destinations, too.\n\n\"We'd be crazy not to want a talented guy like that,\" Robinson said during a recent radio interview on SiriusXM NBA.\n\n\"He's been a force for them. You know, with our system -- I can't really speculate on what it would be like with him, but I certainly think you add a talent like that to a system that can really enhance his impact in the game and make him more efficient. It's just an enjoyable atmosphere where your teammates encourage one another and love one another.\"\n\nIrving has played with one of the league's top three players in LeBron James since \"The King\" returned to the Cavs before the 2014-15 season. If Irving went to San Antonio, he'd play with a very similar two-way star in Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard, who actually won NBA Finals MVP in 2014 against James' Miami Heat.\n\nThe Spurs also are a better coached team than the Cavs, and San Antonio's front office is much better run and doesn't have any of the drama Cleveland's has gone through of late.\n\nThe problem for the Spurs, assuming they'd want to trade for Irving, is they don't have a ton of elite assets to deal aside from Leonard. LaMarcus Aldridge has been a bust as a marquee free agent. Dejounte Murray is a good young player, but likely not enough to be a main piece of a trade package for Irving.\n\nThe Spurs should at least try, though.

The Spurs were mentioned by Irving as one of his four preferred destinations [VIDEO], aside from the New York Knicks, Miami Heat, and the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Cavaliers, for their part, want a win-now veteran, a blue-chip young player a top draft pick for Irving.\n\nRobinson, who played his entire 14-year career with the Spurs and led them to two NBA titles, said Irving has been a force in Cleveland and he believes that San Antonio could enhance his impact in the game and make him more efficient.\n\nAlso, Robinson said the Spurs can present Irving with an enjoyable atmosphere where teammates encourage and love one another. When he demanded a trade, Irving said he wants to become the leader of a team and play away from LeBron James' shadow. \"I can only see positive things. I saw there were some other teams on the list, but we can only dream about good stuff like that,\" Robinson concluded.\n\nA first-round pick by the Spurs in the 1987 Draft, Robinson averaged in double figures in his first 13 years with the team, but his performance dropped in his last season in 2003 due to injuries, averaging just 8.5 points and 7.9 boards in 64 games but the Spurs won their second title. He was a 10-time All-Star and won the Most Valuable Player trophy in 1995. In 987 career games, Robinson averaged 21.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 3.0 blocks.\n\nThe 25-year-old Irving will be an upgrade at point guard for the Spurs, who are still waiting for starter Tony Parker to heal from his injury. If the Spurs acquire him, Irving will give the Spurs a deadly combination alongside Kawhi Leonard and can instantly challenge the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference. The Spurs could offer LaMarcus Aldridge, Danny Green and young point guard Dejounte Murray to the Cavaliers for Irving. Veteran center Pau Gasol and playmaker Patty Mills recently signed new deals with the Spurs and cannot be traded until December. Earlier, it was reported that the Spurs planned to trade Aldridge before the 2017 NBA Draft for a top 10 pick.

According to Woj, the Cavs are \"intrigued\" with Jayson Tatum. Who wouldn't be after the Summer League he had?\n\nIf it takes Tatum to get Kyrie, then what the hell is Danny waiting for? Pull the trigger. Please don't give me the youth argument, because I'll throw it back in your face. Irving is only 25 years old.\n\nIrving is the second-best player in the Eastern Conference, with his short-term teammate, LBJ, being the first. This guy averaged 25.2 ppg and 5.8 assists for the season and 29.4 ppg in the finals against the Warriors, and I thought he played harder than LeBron James in the Cavs' 4-1 series loss to Golden State.\n\nMORE CELTICS:\n\nI don't care if he didn't talk to his teammates. Kobe warmed up on the opposite end of the floor than his team. Michael had a separate dressing area than his teammates and never stayed in the team hotel. I'm about results, not congeniality.\n\nI admit Irving's injury history is significant (he averaged 68 games played over last four years), but his talent makes it worth the risk. His defense has been called into question, but the difference between Irving and Isaiah Thomas is Kyrie can play D when he chooses to. Isaiah can't because of his height.\n\nNow, to the youth the Celtics may not want to let go. Tatum is going to be a very good offensive player in the NBA and Jaylen Brown could someday be an All-Star. But what is the chance they become Kyrie Irving? Very, very slim.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have two of the best young players in the NBA in Karl Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, and you now what? The T-Wolves finished with a 31-51 record. If the Celts made this deal they would get a 25-year-old superstar who could put them in the NBA Finals this year. Yes, I believe the combination of Kyrie and Gordon Hayward could defeat the mighty LeBron.\n\nSo, pull the trigger Danny and get us Kyrie Irving.

This was seen, for example, when they traded 2014 No. 1 pick Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love, or in smaller moves, like trading a draft pick for Kyle Korver.\n\nNow, however, according to Wojnarowski, the Cavs are not simply going to acquire veterans to surround James at the expense of preparing for the future. The Cavs would reportedly still prefer to sign James to a long-term contract and continue to pursue championships, but James' silence on a long-term commitment has them leaning the other way.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the Cavs have targeted a few young stars like Kristaps Porzingis, Jayson Tatum of the Boston Celtics, Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets, and Josh Jackson of the Phoenix Suns. The Celtics are reportedly an intriguing trade partner to the Cavs, and they can blend win-now players with future assets, but Boston is unlikely to jump out with a big offer.\n\nAccording to Wojnarowski, the trade market the Cavs were hoping for for Irving has yet to emerge.\n\nWith or without Irving, James believes the Cavs failed to make up ground on the Golden State Warriors this summer. An earlier report from USA Today said James is \"frustrated\" with the Cavs offseason, and this came before Irving's trade request.\n\nIf the Cavs have their way, they may trade Irving for a serviceable player, a young star, and a future draft pick. That will help them remain competitive this season, while also re-tooling if James leaves in the summer of 2018.\n\nAs Wojnarowski notes, it would mark a new place for the LeBron James Cavs -- good enough to compete, but likely not all that close to championship contention.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100, "id": 153, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World_Literature", "wgt": 100, "id": 549, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/World Literature"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_overall_NBA_draft_picks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304116", "label": {"eng": "List of first overall NBA draft picks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304254", "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307687", "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323680", "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiggins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "347971", "label": {"eng": "Andrew Wiggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368317", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Korver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "404136", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Korver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

While countless insiders have expressed their own takes on the issue, Irving himself has kept quiet on the true cause behind his desire to no longer play for the Cleveland Cavaliers. As time goes on, however, reports continue to give us a better picture of the situation.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Dave McMenamin, who joined the BBallBreakdown podcast on Friday, Irving has been holding a grudge against LeBron James and the Cavaliers for quite some time.\n\n\"I think the root of it goes back to the summer of the 2014 when he was offered a max contract extension and in that meeting, LeBron James' name didn't come up,\" McMenamin said. \"And he was sold on a vision of being the leader of the Cavs' franchise and playing a style of ball reminiscent of Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns and everything being filtered around him as the center piece. And Kyrie believed that that would be his future, the next five years of his career as he went from burgeoning All-Star and starting to make his mark on the league that he would do so with players around him made to fit his game.\n\n\"Of course, 11 days later LeBron James comes out with the 'I'm Coming Home' letter with Lee Jenkins and Sports Illustrated and everything changes. The roster becomes centered around LeBron James, rightfully so most would say. And Kyrie did really well in those three years, while playing in an accelerated growth process rather than kind of get to go through his bumps and bruises and take his licks as the face of the franchise, he was cast into a secondary role.\n\n\"But it wasn't a normal secondary role it was a secondary role where he was expected to be able to compete for championships when he hadn't even played in a playoff series. And so that kind of chafed at him but he did his best to still work with it, but when you get through these three years, there was some sense of finality because David Griffin is leaving the franchise this summer. That was the guy that had been instrumental in keeping Kyrie Irving within the team's structure the last couple of years. And when that's gone, and then you look at the future, the summer of 2018 we all know LeBron James can opt out and become a free agent, it's a sense of, 'I'm going to make sure that my fate is not tied to you anymore. And I will make this request now rather than have to deal with the potential fallout of a post-LeBron era in 2018 for the Cavs organization.'\"\n\nMcMenamin added that despite reports, Irving is not interested in becoming the face of franchise over all else.\n\n\"I have talked to people close to Kyrie, I guess you could say in Kyrie's camp, and they buck against that perception that he is trying to be the man,\" he explained. \"Their framing of the situation is that he wants to be in a different basketball situation that does not involve another man who is so all-encompassing. The LeBron machine is something that is unlike any other team has in the NBA.\"\n\nHe went on to say that it's not that Irving doesn't want to play with great players, but has grown tired by the challenges and expectations that come with playing alongside an all-time great like James.\n\n\"It's more of the idea of rather than playing with an all-time great and all of the pressure of preserving that legacy, adding to that legacy, winning for the sake of, 'This window is so short so we better maximize it,' he'd just go and play with great players, not all-time great players, great players. And get to live probably a more peaceful existence and get back to what basketball is about for him.\"\n\nMuch of McMenamin's insight into the Irving drama is more of what has already been reported regarding Irving's relationship with both James and the Cavaliers. Still, it does seem to paint a much different picture than the common theme of an immature, selfish player, and forces fans to wonder if Irving is simply trying to do whats best for himself, not only as a player in the NBA, but as a human being as well.", "date": "2017-08-13", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 100, "id": 1069, "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310750", "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "345909", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "438567", "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}]}

Cleveland has dealt with as much drama as any team in the league this summer between rumors LeBron James could leave next summer, the departure of general manager David Griffin, failed attempts at trading for a star, and the sudden trade request from star point guard Kyrie Irving.\n\nJames' looming free agency and Irving's trade request both weigh heavily on the organization as it inches ever closer to training camp in what could be the final season of contention for this core group, and both will have an impact on the other. The original idea of the Cavs in trading Irving was to land a starting caliber veteran, a strong young asset on a rookie deal, and a future draft pick, but after failing to get any traction on a deal getting that much in return, their demands have apparently shifted, in part due to fear that James could leave.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Tuesday morning that the Cavs had now shifted focus in Irving trade talks to ensuring they acquire a strong young player and future assets, because of fear that James could leave them with nothing. On The Russillo Show on ESPN Radio, Woj expounded on what was driving the Cavs and how they were trying to learn from the misfortune of others that have seen stars walk.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100, "id": 153, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "337441", "label": {"eng": "ESPN Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russillo_and_Kanell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1439000", "label": {"eng": "Russillo and Kanell"}}]}

[VIDEO]\n\nAnd while a month has passed and the clock is ticking, he remains where he is [VIDEO]. This delay might be a signal that there is going to be no trade yet for Irving. In the Phoenix Suns' side, forward Josh Jackson spoke in a radio interview regarding the four-time NBA All-Star's request saying \"I got a feeling that the trade really wasn't going to happen.\"\n\nJackson was actually close to being traded as he was suitable for the requirements yet the Suns immediately refused to do so which leaves the 20-year-old NBA player to have a calmer transition towards his professional career without getting tangled in any trade.\n\nIrving's request for a new team is still slowly moving as the top teams in the league are probably focused on practice for the new season.\n\nAnother team that might have Irving is the San Antonio Spurs which was rumored to be his top choice.\n\nIt is possible that the Cavs are a little disappointed over Irving's decision which makes the trade a little slow to process considering the kind of player they want in exchange. Unfortunately, he does not want to play under Lebron James' shadow anymore even though they have been quite the trophies for the Cavs with Lebron taking the lead most of the time.\n\nIf Kyrie Irving does indeed get transferred to another team, it will picture yet another exciting season for the NBA league. Fans would be looking forward to a court with Kyrie and Lebron do not wear the same jersey. Although Irving's name remains significant with his NBA All Star records, difficult factors come into the picture which delays his request. #NBA Trade Rumors", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305866", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316231", "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "322747", "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_Waiters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "370752", "label": {"eng": "Dion Waiters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_All-Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "381417", "label": {"eng": "List of NBA All-Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "490222", "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}]}

I saw there were some other teams on the list, but we can only dream about good stuff like that.\"\n\nIrving, 25, would certainly be an upgrade at point guard for San Antonio, and the thought of pairing him with superstar Kawhi Leonard would give the Spurs one of the league's best one-two punches. Irving would give the team a jolt of instant offense and make them more threatening to teams like the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets in the Western Conference.\n\nThe issue for the Spurs, of course, is that it's hard to imagine what pieces they have in place to entice Cleveland to trade them for Irving.\n\nLeonard is off the table, LaMarcus Aldridge has a salary (and a declining game) the Cavaliers likely wouldn't want, Pau Gasol is 37 and well past his prime, and Patty Mills and Danny Green are nice pieces but not nearly enough of a return for a player of Irving's caliber. Dejounte Murray is a promising but incredibly inexperienced 20-year-old point guard.\n\nPlus, Gasol and Mills signed new contracts this summer and can't be traded until December.\n\nSo if the Spurs are in the market for Irving, they'll have to get pretty creative and likely involve multiple teams in the deal. Even then, it seems highly unlikely Irving would find his way to San Antonio. So while the Spurs would indeed be \"crazy\" to spurn a talent like Irving, crazier still is trying to imagine a scenario in which they could actually land him.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199248"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307687", "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307688", "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "316235", "label": {"eng": "Patty Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau_Gasol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "319846", "label": {"eng": "Pau Gasol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "319894", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "329081", "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334399", "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "341173", "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "360508", "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robinson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "396435", "label": {"eng": "David Robinson (basketball)"}}]}

Surprisingly, the Knicks are still entertaining the idea of trading their 7'3\" Latvian. While reports suggested that the Zen Master dreamt of bringing Lonzo Ball to the Mecca in exchange for Kristaps, new information suggests a different point guard may be exchanged for the Unicorn.\n\nAlbeit confusing, Kyrie Irving still wants to be a New York Knick. God only knows why, but he does. The Cavaliers seem to be set on trading him. Although talks of Irving's departure have cooled down since his trade request, the Cavs seem to be preparing for a season without Kyrie. They signed Derrick Rose in a possible attempt to replace Irving in the starting lineup. Even if they manage to mend the relationship between LeBron James and Irving, the Cavs have set themselves up well. Although Rose is not the same caliber player he was during his MVP season, he is still an above average point guard. Last season in New York, D-Rose put up 18 points to go along with 4.4 assists per game on 47.1% FG shooting. Those numbers make him better than a good chunk of the league. If Kyrie were to stay, the Cavs would have the backcourt depth they needed against Golden State in this year's finals.\n\nWith the addition of Rose it's clear that the Cleveland Cavaliers are looking at the big picture, as they should. Due to LeBron James' uncertain future in Cleveland, the Cavs are planning for a future without their King. Should James ditch Ohio for the bright lights and palm trees of Los Angeles, the Cavs need to prepare.\n\nThe Cavaliers are still exploring trade packages for Kyrie Irving. Getting a team outside of his wishlist (Spurs, Knicks, Wolves, and Heat) to take Irving without guaranteeing he'll re-sign once he hits free agency, is proving to be a lofty proposition. Teams have been more cautious in recent years when dealing with situations such as these because how the Lakers essentially rented Dwight Howard for a season. Irving having a wishlist of destinations makes dealing him harder for Cleveland because of such uncertainty.\n\nOne team Cleveland remains interested in negotiating with is the New York Knicks. They are willing to deal Irving to the Big Apple, but at a steep cost. The Cavs will only trade Irving for a package that includes Kristaps Porzingis. While Irving is the better player now, it can be said that Porzingis holds more potential for the future. Porzingis, 22, is three years younger than Irving. While that is not a huge disparity, Kyrie has not proven capable of success without LeBron James. While the same can be said for Porzingis, as the Knicks have failed to make the playoffs in each of his first two seasons, his style of play can help teams contend.\n\nPorzingis at 7'3\" is capable of protecting the rim. He's averaged 1.9 blocks, good for the top 10 in the league, for his first two seasons. With the slight, slender frame he displayed when he came to the league, that is impressive. KP will only improve as he gains muscle in the NBA, helping wreak havoc on both ends of the floor. Irving is subpar on defense. He is mediocre at best. It's been proven that defense wins championships. Irving is as skilled with a basketball as Langston Hughes with a pen. Irving's play truly is poetry in motion, but is that enough to win championships as \"The Man\" which Kyrie intends to become?\n\nWhile Cleveland eyes a Irving-Porzingis swap, they should not get their hopes up. It seems as if the only reason these reports have any merit is because of Joakim Noah's horrendous contract. The Knicks, now needing to clean up Phil Jackson's mess, are looking to unload Noah's salary. They are doing so in the wrong place. Why trade Noah, whose contract expires following the 2019-2020 season, with Porzingis? Porzingis can still be a Knick when Noah's contract is off the books. Dealing KP just to get a team to take Joakim is literally the epitome of the Knicks doing \"Knick things.\"\n\nPorzingis has rightfully been compared to Dirk Nowitzki, yet the Knicks still would be fine with the exchange. Porzingis and Dirk both share a similar play style. The slight differences favor the Latvian. KP and Nowitzki both boast smooth jumpers as 7-footers. KP possesses playmaking ability that we have never seen Dirk display. Porzingis is also a much better defender than Dirk has shown. While these are obviously high expectations for a guy who only has two seasons under his belt, the numbers are intriguing. The young star even has the praise of the Mavs' legend.

And even though Irving has let Cleveland know which team he prefers to go to, the Cavs are listening to every team, as they want the best offer.\n\nSo if the player is on the block and the team is willing to listen, why not make an offer, even if your chances of winning the bid are slim?\n\nThis is the logic that the Raptors' general manager Bobby Webster used when he explained to TSN why he offered the Cavaliers a deal for their star point guard.\n\nSpeaking to TSN 1050's Michael Landsberg and Matt Cauz, Webster said that he \"definitely\" called the Cavaliers to talk about Irving because he would have been \"remiss\" if he didn't.\n\nPer The Score:\n\n\"Definitely,\" Webster told TSN 1050's Michael Landsberg and Matt Cauz. \"We all do our due diligence. Things don't always make sense, but if they do we're always prepared.\n\n\"That's a lot of talk that we do, that doesn't really see the light of day that happens behind closed doors,\" Webster added. \"When a player like that becomes available you'd be remiss not to call.\"\n\nIf the Raptors are miraculously able to get Irving from the Cavaliers, the four-time All-Star could help them out a lot. Irving is a very skilled offensive player who can score in multiple ways and can improve the Raptors' lack of offensive consistency.\n\nHowever, he probably can't fit into the Raptors' roster as they just re-signed All-Star Kyle Lowry (who also plays point guard) to a three-year, $100-million contract. In addition to that, Lowry can't be traded until January, and I have a feeling Irving wants to leave Cleveland as soon as possible.\n\nLast season, Irving averaged 25.2 points, 5.8 assists and 1.2 steals.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303004", "label": {"eng": "Contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Lowry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "304130", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Lowry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321241", "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "323679", "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sports_Network", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "342190", "label": {"eng": "The Sports Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHUM_(AM)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "846928", "label": {"eng": "CHUM (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Landsberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1031013", "label": {"eng": "Michael Landsberg"}}]}

Not only will it help determine the ceiling for this team, but it may influence their ability to retain LeBron James.\n\nWe know that the Cavs asking price for Irving is a starter, a rookie contract player, and a draft pick. But what players and positions they will receive help at from a trade remains to be seen. Irving has shouldered a massive load over the last couple seasons and trying to find a way to replace that may be a struggle.\n\nIf the Cavs don't receive a point guard in return, that would leave Derrick Rose, Kay Felder and Jose Calderon as the teams point guards. Felder and Calderon are clearly not starting caliber, but the presence of Rose gives the team a legitimate option.\n\nRose may not be the same player he was at his peak, and he's not close to Irving's level, but he's still a starting caliber player at his position if he needed to be. Even though he's likely a low-end option and the fit may be questionable, it still is a viable option if he stays healthy. It would present the team with an opportunity to address other needs if they feel comfortable banking on Rose.\n\nBut when you look at what the Cavs should target in return, it's important to fully understand the role that Irving filled. With the starting unit, Irving provided the team with a second initiator for the offense and a spot up threat. Something Rose wouldn't bring to the table, as he is not a threat from deep and is not accustomed to playing off-ball. While his ability to be a lead ball handler with the second unit is an asset, playing with LeBron James and the starters would limit his effectiveness.\n\nInstead of targeting a more traditional point guard or somebody that needs the ball in their hands, the Cavs may be better suited targeting a combo guard. A player like Gary Harris or Jamal Murray would perfectly fit the Cavs due to their ability to space the floor and provide secondary play making.\n\nHaving a combo guard would also give the Cavs a contingency plan for J.R. Smith, or at the very least an option at shooting guard moving forward. The more lineup versatility the Cavs can acquire, the better suited they will be to take on the Warriors.\n\nIf Irving is traded, it would also give the Cavs an opportunity to utilize Kevin Love in a bigger role. He initiated a lot of the offense in Minnesota and would likely be the team's second best player without Irving. With the presence of Irving and James, it wasn't beneficial to the team to maximize Love. But without Irving, failing to maximize Love would be foolish.\n\nWith both James and Love heavily involved, there just isn't a huge need for a traditional point guard. As long as James is on the team, it's not necessary to have another player take the ball out of his hands.\n\nIf the Cavs can't land a combo guard, they still should look to get a score first point guard, preferably one that can shoot. The ability to knock down shots would help make the transition to playing off of James easier, even if the player is accustomed to being the primary initiator. While Rose is a passable option, the Cavs can't risk jeopardizing the chemistry that they have with their starting unit. A shooter needs to be their top priority -- something Rose, a career 29.8 percent career three-point shooter, is not.\n\nThe Cavs have been tight lipped throughout this process and it's hard to get a sense for what is actually available in exchange for Irving. Trying to get pieces that fit that also help you win-now, while hedging for the future is a pretty tall order.

According to a piece written by Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the team is looking in a direction of a future without LeBron James.\n\nIt's important to note that the Cleveland Cavaliers are not obligated to grant Irving's request since the All-Star point guard is under contract for a minimum of two more seasons.\n\nAlthough the 22-year-old Latvia native popped up in the rumor mill earlier in the offseason, that speculation has faded considerably since the Knicks parted ways with former team president Phil Jackson.\n\nThe Cavs reportedly have a \"primary target\" in a potential Kyrie Irving trade.\n\nThe Knicks should've exhibited such foresight before dealing for Carmelo Anthony over six years ago.\n\nThat's certainly possible, if not plausible, but it's not at all a sign that the Knicks are attempting to trade Porzingis.\n\nCleveland is now uninterested in doing so, which has temporarily stalled the entirety of the trade discussions.\n\n\"This Irving trade process has been deliberate, and teams believe that the Cavaliers expect more aggressive conversations in September, closer to the start of training camps\", Wojnarowski added. Stay tuned for the latest buzz on a potential Kyrie Irving Trade. Boston also has upcoming draft picks and some other assets that could potentially work in a deal. He has been slow to react to Tony Parker's fast decline, but it doesn't mean he's going to gut his team's depth or future just to land Irving. The Suns do not want to part with Jackson or Devin Booker.\n\nIrving is hoping the Spurs make a move, but it's hard to see the Spurs coming up with the pieces to add Irving. Irving would give the Celtics a backup plan as well if Isaiah Thomas refuses to resign.\n\nOn Tuesday it appeared he found his run in the form of a pickup game that featured enough talented players to make up half an All-Star team.

Trading a 25-year-old four-time All-Star and player who hit one of the biggest three-pointers in franchise history is no easy task, though.\n\nCleveland is remaining patient while it sorts through whatever options may be available, and it's sounding like new Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman might be parsing his list down to a handful of players to replace Kyrie with.\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski published a massive update on how the situation is unfolding in Cleveland, and he singled out four players that the Cavaliers are interested in. The common thread between all of them is that they're young stars the team can build toward the future with.\n\nKristaps Porzingis of the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics' lottery pick Jayson Tatum, Josh Jackson of the Phoenix Suns and Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets are the players the Cavaliers are focused on, according to Wojnarowski.\n\nIt's an interesting group of players, and any of them could be the centerpiece of a trade that sends Irving out of Cleveland. It's clear the Cavaliers want a player still on his rookie deal with plenty of upside still to discover.\n\nThe trade that would make the most noise out of that group is sending Kyrie to New York for Kristaps, which would be a huge moment for the league. Porzingis is a \"primary target,\" according to Wojnarowski, but the Knicks may be unwilling to part ways with their supremely talented big man.\n\nThe Cavaliers would have to also be willing to absorb the three years and $55 million owed to Joakim Noah, per Wojnarowski, and even then the Knicks are showing an unwillingness to engage in that discussion as they control damage left behind from Phil Jackson.\n\nTrading a player of Irving's caliber is always difficult, but the Cavaliers have some leverage despite the widely-reported trade request from Kyrie. He's under contract for at least two seasons, with a player option on Year 3. In recent years, teams and stars have waited until the potential final season together before acknowledging it's time they part ways.\n\nCleveland has its priorities set on a young star to build toward the future with.

Also worth mentioning is the fact the Cavs didn't have a GM until hiring Koby Altman on July 24, over a month after David Griffin's departure.\n\nThe odds of the Raptors actually landing Irving are slim. Not only is Lowry signed for the next three years, Toronto almost certainly doesn't have the pieces to complete the trade with Cleveland.\n\nESPN.com's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the Cavs see the Irving trade as a way to rebuild should LeBron James leave.

The Cleveland Cavaliers are, in quite a few respects, a first-rate organization. Their in-game entertainment staff, their practice and training facilities, the analytics and scouting departments and communications team all rank among the very best the NBA has to offer. As far as I can tell, employees enjoy working there.\n\nBut from the time that LeBron James left Cleveland until the time he fell to the ground celebrating the same town's first professional championship in over 50 years, it's been an organization operating in various levels of dysfunction and chaos. No list going through the tumult would be complete, but it might be helpful to go through a few of the ups and downs, in close to chronological order.\n\nAND EVERYONE GOT ALONG. No one was fired. LeBron didn't really send out any passive-aggressive tweets or Instagram posts. He called out David Griffin over the past year, asking for another playmaker on top of the insanely high tax bill Dan Gilbert was already paying. The team had ups and downs, and wasn't a great regular season team. If LeBron rested, the team lost. They didn't seem to care much. There wasn't much angst. James seemed to go out of his way to praise Irving and build him up. No one really bothered Love, and even though his name came up around the trade deadline it wasn't anywhere near what it had been in the two years preceding it.\n\nIt was really nice. It was as though an NBA title had allowed them to graduate to a new level of maturity and competence. Throughout the year I commented often how much it seemed like the guys really liked one another. Even as they lost in the Finals in 5 games, I wanted the team to be kept together.\n\nWell, that's probably not going to happen. Griffin was functionally fired after his contract expired and terms on a new deal couldn't be agreed upon. The team tried to replace him with Chauncey Billups, but he could sense something wasn't right and ultimately said no; the fact that he was reportedly low-balled may not have helped either.\n\nNow Kyrie Irving wants to leave, and instead of a quick deal to move on, the situation has festered and lingered. Maybe they don't have great deals on the table right now. Hard to see how they get better over time. Maybe there is something already agreed to. Uncertainty once again looms for the Cavaliers.\n\nI would like to say that the dysfunction is somehow comforting, that getting back to normal is just how it is as a Cavs fan. Maybe if it were Love asking for the trade I'd feel that way. But Irving wanting to leave feels more like the chickens coming home to roost.

If he wants to get paid, he'll show up and play. No matter his heart's desire, the Cavaliers have him for two full seasons, if they want him.\n\nMany have compared the situation to Kobe Bryant's trade request in 2007. Kobe made his demands with three years remaining on his contract. The Lakers called his bluff, knowing Bryant had no real contractual leverage. (There were suggestions he simply wouldn't report to training camp due to his unrest. He reported to training camp.) The Lakers eventually pulled off the huge trade for Pau Gasol at midseason, made the NBA Finals, and watched Kobe win his first and only NBA MVP award. He never became a free agent again.\n\nThis has been presented as a model for how the Cavaliers ought to deal with Kyrie. But there is one problem, of course.\n\nKobe demanded a trade because he felt the Lakers were not equipped as a team to compete at the highest levels. (They weren't.) L.A. had a clear path to settling Kobe's qualms: get better. They did. The Lakers identified a path to pleasing Kobe and defusing his trade demand, and executed it.\n\nKyrie has reportedly requesting a trade not because the Cavaliers can't win -- three straight NBA Finals with a title in there says otherwise -- but because Irving wants to be an alpha dog on his own franchise. Irving is reportedly requesting a trade because he has tired under LeBron James' tutelage, or because the Cavs are too dysfunctional for his tastes. The reasons his camp have floated vary depending on the weather.\n\nNone of them are easily solved.\n\nTrade demands like Kobe's are simple to resolve. Either you get better soon enough to defuse the anger, or you don't, in which you case you make a trade when there's still runway left.\n\nWhat does success look like if you keep Kyrie? The Cavaliers cannot trade LeBron, either technically (he has a trade veto) or theoretically (he's LeBron f'n James). There are rumors James will leave of his own volition in 2018, and it's plausible Cleveland could wait for that eventuality before dealing with Irving's request. That makes for one awkward season and a very strange 2018 free agency recruiting period. Any iota of attention Cleveland dedicates to LeBron in that case is a slap in Kyrie's face.\n\nIn some sort of utopia, LeBron could cede control of the offense completely to Irving, letting him put up the MVP numbers he apparently believes he can. James could become another of Kyrie's jump shooters, a new Channing Frye or Kyle Korver. He could defer to the brash New Jersey kid to the point of discomfort, and likely to the Cavaliers' discontent as the No. 1 seed in the East flutters ever further away. The Cavaliers could give Kyrie exactly what he says he wants by subduing the Greatest of His Generation and Maybe All Time, a thriving living legend who could win MVP every year if the voters wouldn't get bored.\n\nThey could. They shouldn't. They won't.\n\nThe Cavaliers have now seen the true Kyrie Irving. He prioritizes the glory of self over collective achievement. That's peculiar to be certain, but it's not indefensible. (Kyrie's only indefensible crime is the Flat Earth nonsense. I wish he'd drop that gimmick off the edge of the planet.)\n\nGiven what the Warriors have done, the Cavaliers' margin for error is infinitesimal. Internal strife is self-inflicted pain. The Warriors and others will do Cleveland enough harm that the Cavaliers can't afford to be helping them out.\n\nThere's no sense in wasting one of LeBron's final seasons -- hell, maybe his very last campaign as a Cavalier. Some of us remain convinced James is never leaving northeastern Ohio to play basketball elsewhere. But after all that has happened, who can truly be certain? There's no time to deal the cards and see what hand presents itself. It's time to recommit to LeBron by dealing Kyrie, lest you ensure that you lose them both.\n\nKyrie doesn't have hard leverage, but the circumstances have aligned to force the Cavaliers to give him what he wants.

The All-Star point guard requested a trade from the front office in hopes to find a new team. Why? That is because he dreams of being the focal point. Obviously, with James, he cannot be the captain of the ship.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Kyrie Irving's decision stems from his desire to be the main guy [VIDEO]. Perhaps, the spotlight is more important to him now than winning another NBA title. However, there are those who believe that the move is perhaps due to having a toxic work relationship.\n\nIn a report from Forbes, one of the great thinkers in the field of relationship named John Maxwell was asked about his take on the Irving trade issue.\n\nHe was asked if, in one way or another, the Cavaliers could patch things up and return things to their normal state.\n\nMaxwell, however, was sure that such thing would never happen in the organization. \"Kyrie's good enough to be a number one player on a team,\" he said. Unfortunately, Maxwell does not believe [VIDEO] in Irving's potentials to become the number one player on a team. The kind of player \"that can make it to a championship.\"\n\nMaxwell explained that even if Kyrie Irving is a great player, the team can never play its best when he is on the floor. He suggested that Irving does not have the kind of leadership bubble, making it difficult for his team to live in. Irving does not even appreciate the things that James does on the floor. Maxwell pointed out that if not for James, Irving will not be able to do what he does best on the court.\n\nIf he ends up with another team, it is very likely for him to replicate the thing he does in Cleveland.\n\nMaxwell noted that Kyrie Irving's decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers is a lesson that can be both applied on either a personal or business aspect [VIDEO]. People should be really careful with what they wish for, most especially if this wish came from the need for more acclaim. In fact, the most noticeable example in the world of sports is none other Neymar, one of the iconic soccer players in recent memory. Neymar said that playing alongside Messi will result to being looked up as second. Unfortunately for him, the decision to leave Messi has taken its toll on his career.\n\nKyrie Irving, on the other hand, is in the same boat as Neymar's. He also wants to take a shot at the spotlight, longing to be the focal point in a team. Forbes adds that Irving's decision is a result of jealousness.

But the All-Star guard wouldn't come cheap.\n\nIn an article on the Cavs' offseason strategy Tuesday, ESPN insider Adrian Wojnarowski explained that Cleveland is bracing for the possibility that LeBron James departs in free agency next summer, which would signal a need for a rebuild. As such, the Cavs only would trade Irving if they can get draft picks and/or young assets in return.\n\nMore specifically, Cleveland is \"fixated\" on acquiring a \"young star\" and is focused on four players, Wojnarowski reported, citing league sources: New York Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis, Phoenix Suns rookie Josh Jackson, Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray and Celtics top draft pick Jayson Tatum.\n\nTatum hasn't been mentioned in many Celtics-Cavs trade scenarios for Irving, most of which involved Boston giving up point guard Isaiah Thomas, forward Jae Crowder and a first-round draft pick. But Wojnarowski noted Tatum could put the C's over the hump, as president of basketball operations Danny Ainge and Co. could offer \"the best combination of short-term (Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder) and long-term (Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, picks) assets.\"\n\nYet would the C's be willing to part with Tatum, who supposedly was at the top of Ainge's draft board ahead of Markelle Fultz and Lonzo Ball? Per Wojnarowski, Boston is aware that the Cavs are \"mostly intrigued with Tatum,\" but the sides haven't formally discussed a deal.\n\nTeams expect Cleveland to pick up Irving talks in September as the regular season draws nearer, according to Wojnarowski, so we could find out soon if the two Eastern Conference rivals decide to do business.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100, "id": 108, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "wgt": 100, "id": 690, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304129", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323680", "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334444", "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348525", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "356442", "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "384776", "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jae_Crowder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "389203", "label": {"eng": "Jae Crowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1270004", "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270415", "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1274525", "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}]}

According to them, Cleveland would have to take on Joakim Noah's bulbous contract in order to have any shot at 22-year-old Porzingis. Though ESPN also noted that Porzingis trade talk is currently a \"nonstarter\" when it comes to potential transaction discussions.\n\nAs Adrian Wojnarowski put it:\n\nPorzingis has emerged as a primary Cleveland target, but that's a conversation that can occur only with Cleveland's willingness to unburden the Knicks of the three years and $55 million left on Joakim Noah's contract. For now, the conversation is a nonstarter for the Knicks, league sources said.\n\nSounds like they need to look somewhere else for now.\n\nAccording to the same article, the Cavs are planning their future based around the assumption that LeBron James could leave... again. It says that if the team was convinced LeBron was staying for the foreseeable future, then they'd be more likely to add a veteran to the team's core so the franchise would have a greater chance to win now.\n\nAgain, as Adrian Wojnarowski put it:\n\nThe Cavaliers have witnessed James' exit strategy twice -- once to leave Cleveland and once to return -- and the Irving trade request has left them unwilling to squander the opportunity to replenish young assets on a roster that could be crippled in a post-James Cavaliers era that is stocked with high-priced veterans.\n\nThe Cavaliers find themselves far more fixated on a young star, including New York's Kristaps Porzingis, Boston's Jayson Tatum, Phoenix's Josh Jackson and Denver's Jamal Murray, league sources told ESPN.\n\nAll good things come to an end.

Murray and Thomas, who are both alumni of the University of Washington, worked out together in Washington. Murray has posted the photos of their workout on Instagram. Aside from Thomas, Murray also worked out with Spurs star player Kawhi Leonard. Murray needs to further sharpen his skills as Spurs starting point Tony Parker will be out until January or February. Patty Mills, who recently signed a four-year, $50 million deal with the Spurs, is expected to start while Murray will back him up.\n\nLast season, Murray played just 38 games, averaging 3.4 points, 1.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists in 8.5 minutes of action per game. When Parker went down with an injury in the playoff, Murray played 11 games, averaging 5.7 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2.5 assists. In the offseason, Murray also spent time with LeBron James and Ben Simmons.\n\nMurray and Thomas have something in common as they are both rumored to be trade baits for Cleveland Cavaliers point guard #Kyrie Irving, who recently asked for a trade. On July 7, Irving met with Cavaliers team owner Dan Gilbert and presented his four preferred trade destinations - the Spurs, New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Miami Heat. The Cavaliers reportedly want a win-now veteran, a blue-chip young player, and a top pick.\n\nThe Spurs and the Celtics have made their respective offers for Irving that reportedly include both Murray and Thomas.\n\nAccording to Zach Lowe of ESPN, the Celtics have inquired with the Cavs about a potential swap to keep them [VIDEO] in the thick of negotiations involving Irving. Aside from Thomas, the Celtics might also offer Jae Crowder and one of their top picks for next season. Thomas is expected to receive a maximum deal from the Celtics after playing last season on a bargain.

According to Woj, the Cavs are \"intrigued\" with Jayson Tatum. Who wouldn't be after the summer league he had?\n\nIf it takes Tatum to get Kyrie, then what the hell is Danny waiting for? Pull the trigger. Please do not give me the youth argument, because I will throw it back in your face. Kyrie is on twenty-five years old.\n\nIrving is the second best player in the Eastern Conference with his short term teammate, LBJ, being the first. This guy averaged 25.2 ppg and 5.8 assists for the season and 29.4ppg in the finals against the Warriors, and I thought he played harder than Lebron James in the Cavs' 4-1 loss to Golden State.\n\nMORE CELTICS:\n\nI don't care if he didn't talk to his teammates. Kobe warmed up on the opposite end of the floor than his team and Michael had a separate dressing area than his teammates and never stayed in the team hotel. I am about results not congeniality. I admit that Irving's injury history is significant (he averaged 68 games played over last four years), but his talent makes it worth the risk. His defense has been called into question, but the difference between he and Isaiah Thomas is Kyrie can play D when he chooses to and Isaiah can't because of his height.\n\nNow, to the youth the Celtics may not want to let go. Jayson Tatum is going to be a very good offensive player in the NBA and Jaylen Brown could someday be an All-Star, but what is the chance they become Kyrie Irving? Very, very slim.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves has two of the best young players in the NBA in Karl Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins and you now what? The T-Wolves finished with a 31-51 record. If the Celts made this deal they would get a 25-year-old super star that could put them in the NBA finals this year. Yes, I believe that the combination of Kyrie and Gordon Hayward could defeat the mighty Lebron.\n\nSo, pull the trigger Danny and get us Kyrie Irving. Of course, the Spurs are now in on the act and Irving said he wants to play for the Knicks, Heat or Minnesota. If this doesn't happen, Danny, there is always Anthony Davis!", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic", "wgt": 100, "id": 827, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Yard,_Deck,_and_Table_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 1063, "label": "dmoz/Games/Yard, Deck, and Table Games"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "K\u014dbe-shi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u014dbe-shi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "66509"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "type": "loc", "id": "213450"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307687", "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "329076", "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "345014", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "345909", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiggins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "347971", "label": {"eng": "Andrew Wiggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "384776", "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270415", "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}]}

Let's continue today with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nUntil we see how the Cleveland Cavaliers address Kyrie Irving's reported trade request, fantasy basketball owners must bake uncertainty into each Cleveland player's projected outlook for the 2017-18 season.\n\nIf the Cavs trade Irving, their remaining players' fantasy values will be contingent on who Cleveland receives in return. Shipping him to Phoenix for a package built around Eric Bledsoe would cause Derrick Rose to plummet back to the realm of fantasy non-factors, while Kevin Love would likely move back into a third-banana offensive role. Sending Irving to Denver and receiving no backcourt help outside of Jamal Murray could force Rose into a starting role, potentially giving him top-100 upside, while LeBron James would figure to assume even more ball-handling duties.\n\nBy the time fantasy basketball drafts roll around in late September and early October, we thankfully should have a far better grasp on Cleveland's approach. If the Cavs bring Irving to training camp, an imminent trade would appear less likely, although owners would have to brace themselves for a possible midseason deal. (Players who signed with new teams in free agency aren't eligible to be traded until Dec. 15, so Cleveland may wait to move Irving until then.) Ideally, the Cavs will ship Irving out between now and camp, thus eliminating the chance of a major shakeup toward the trade deadline.\n\nWhich Cavaliers players should fantasy owners target with early-, mid- and late-round picks, and who should be left on the waiver wire? Let's take a look.\n\nEarly-round picks\n\nLeBron James, SF: Regardless of what happens with Irving, James makes for a rock-solid pick toward the end of the first round or beginning of the second. He set new career highs in rebounds (8.6) and assists (8.7) last season to go with 26.4 points on 54.8 percent shooting, 1.7 triples and 1.2 steals in a league-leading 37.8 minutes per game. James finished as the 14th-ranked player on a per-game basis in nine-category leagues due to his high number of turnovers (4.1) and mediocre free-throw shooting (67.4 percent), but he was the top player in fantasy if you remove those two categories. Owners willing to punt on either should confidently select James with their first-round pick, as an Irving trade would likely only further bolster his value.\n\nKyrie Irving, PG: A full year-plus removed from the broken kneecap he suffered during the 2016 NBA Finals, Irving erupted last season to the tune of a career-high 25.2 points on 47.3 percent shooting, 5.8 assists, 3.2 rebounds, 2.5 treys and 1.2 steals in 35.1 minutes per game. That enabled him to finish as the 17th-ranked player on a per-game basis in nine-category leagues, a huge step up from his 55th-place finish the previous season. Irving's trade request casts a shadow on his fantasy outlook this season, however, as there's no telling which team he'll be on at the beginning of the year -- or, more importantly, during the fantasy playoffs. Regardless of whether he stays in Cleveland or winds up elsewhere, he'll be worth a look toward the end of the second round or beginning of the third, but risk-averse owners should look elsewhere.\n\nKevin Love, PF: It took three years, but Love finally began to look like his old self for the first time in a Cleveland uniform last season. The four-time All-Star went off for 19.0 points on 42.7 percent shooting, 11.1 rebounds, 2.4 triples, 1.9 assists and 0.9 steals in just 31.4 minutes, finishing as the 30th-ranked player on a per-game basis in nine-category leagues. If the Cavaliers trade Irving and don't receive an established talent in return (such as Eric Bledsoe), Love could have to shoulder more offensive responsibility, making him an even more enticing fantasy option. He makes for a strong target toward the end of the third or beginning of the fourth round.\n\nAP Photo by Leah Klafczynski/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire\n\nMid-round picks\n\nN/A\n\nLate-round picks\n\nDerrick Rose, PG: No Cavaliers player's fantasy value is more contingent on the results of a prospective Irving trade than Rose's. If Irving stays in Cleveland or the Cavs flip him for an established point guard, Rose would likely come off the bench and be waiver-wire fodder. If the Cavs ship out Irving and promote Rose to the starting lineup, however, he'd suddenly become an intriguing late-round option with potential top-100 upside. During his lone season with the New York Knicks, Rose finished as the 120th-ranked player on a per-game basis in nine-category leagues after averaging 18.0 points on 47.1 percent shooting, 4.4 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 0.7 steals in 32.5 minutes. He's worth a late-round flier given the chances of him moving into a starting role at some point this season, but don't spend a top-100 pick on him unless he's guaranteed the starting job heading into camp.\n\nJ.R. Smith, SG: On the first year of his four-year, $57 million contract, JR Smith was a resounding disappointment, having averaged just 8.6 points on a career-worst 34.6 percent shooting, 2.8 rebounds, 2.3 treys, 1.5 assists and 1.0 steals in 29.0 minutes to finish as the 172nd-ranked player on a per-game basis in nine-category leagues. Off-court issues likely factored into those struggles, though, as his daughter was born five months premature in January, according to ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. With his daughter having been released from the neonatal intensive care unit in May, Smith can now focus on having a bounce-back 2017-18 campaign. If nothing else, he's worth a late-round flier as a three-point specialist, but keep in mind he was the 93rd-ranked player on a per-game basis in 2015-16, too. There's high upside here.\n\nTristan Thompson, PF: If you need help with rebounds or field goal percentage with one of your final few picks, Thompson is worth a look. The 26-year-old finished as the 137th-ranked player on a per-game basis in nine-category leagues last season after averaging 8.1 points on a career-high 60.0 percent shooting, 9.2 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 29.9 minutes per game. Thompson also shot a career-worst 49.8 percent from the charity stripe, but his paltry 2.7 free-throw attempts per game helped reduce the damage he did to fantasy owners in that category. Thompson isn't a high-upside pick, but he's a safe bet for boards, field goal percentage and the occasional block.\n\nWaiver-wire fodder\n\nKay Felder, PG\n\nJose Calderon, PG\n\nIman Shumpert, SG\n\nKyle Korver, SG\n\nCedi Osman, SF\n\nRichard Jefferson, SF\n\nJeff Green, SF\n\nChanning Frye, PF\n\nWalter \"Edy\" Tavares, C\n\nSleepers/Busts\n\nSleeper: JR Smith\n\nBust: Derrick Rose\n\nOther team breakdowns\n\nAtlanta Hawks | Boston Celtics | Brooklyn Nets | Charlotte Hornets | Chicago Bulls\n\nAll rankings via Basketball Monster are based on nine-category leagues.

With all the talk of trades and problems all over, all that much may not be different after all.\n\nLeBron James will still be a Cavalier this upcoming season, and as of now, so will all of his 2016-17 teammates, aside from James Jones, who has retired. This includes Kyrie Irving, who wants out of Cleveland so he can be a star of his own. Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, strongly believes that Kyrie isn't going anywhere, as no team has put up a deal good enough, despite the desires of Kyrie.\n\nIf Kyrie stays, the only noteworthy change to the roster is the addition of point guard Derrick Rose, who Cleveland acquired from the New York Knicks through the free agency. The signing of Rose both makes and doesn't make sense. The same way the Golden State Warriors added superstar Kevin Durant, the Cavs needed to add significant talent to their roster if they wanted to reach the finals for a fourth year in a row and redeem themselves once again. Although last season Rose was more like the \"old\" Derrick Rose, his outside shooting and defense still fell in bottom percentiles of the league, which could potentially hinder the Cavaliers if they were to be in the finals. Rose is a solid attacker and can put up the points, If he can get to the net, but don't count on him to shoot any three's. If this weren't the case, signing the former MVP would have been a great move by Cleveland, one that would give them an extra edge against Golden State.\n\nMaking this even more concerning are the Kyrie Irving rumors. It has been almost a month since it was released that Kyrie wants to leave the Cavaliers to no longer play in the shadow of LeBron James, but little progress has been made. Although it currently looks like Kyrie will be on the Cavaliers for the 2017-2018 season, it would be interesting to see what would happen if he wasn't. As mentioned earlier, Rose can't hit three's the way Kyrie can, and although their names can replace one another on the depth chart, without knowing where Kyrie is going and who exactly the Cavs would be getting in return for him, it's impossible to say the kind of state the Cavs would be in. Another possibility is that if Kyrie stays, he doesn't give his all, because he doesn't want to be there, which is a surefire way for the team to fall to the bottom of the standings rather quickly.\n\nThings went from hopeful to unclear in Cleveland rather quickly. Overall, it seems that the only things stopping the Cleveland Cavaliers are the Cleveland Cavaliers.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304119", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307687", "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323674", "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991\u201392_Cleveland_Cavaliers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "334887", "label": {"eng": "1991\u201392 Cleveland Cavaliers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "345909", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "367654", "label": {"eng": "Derrick Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}]}

But despite the offseason drama surrounding LeBron James & Co., does the road to the NBA Finals still go through The Land?\n\nWe asked the ESPN Forecast panel of 44 experts to rank its top three choices for the 2017-18 Eastern Conference champions, with a first-place vote receiving five points, a second-place vote receiving three and a third-place vote receiving one.\n\nComments: For all the offseason drama, the road through the East still goes through Cleveland, as more than 75 percent of our panel picked the Cavaliers to reach the NBA Finals for the fourth straight season. Potential chemistry issues aside, if Kyrie Irving is in a Cavs uniform, it's tough to peg anyone else in that top spot.\n\nEven if they were to trade Irving, there's evidence that LeBron James & Co. have enough to get the job done. Over the plast three seasons, the Cavaliers have played 3,828 minutes -- about 80 full games worth -- with James on the floor without Irving. In those minutes, they've outscored teams by 9.6 points per 100 possessions, nearly identical to the plus-9.5 figure they've posted with both James and Irving on the court. Though Irving's shot-making in high-leverage spots might be impossible to replace, all signs point to LeBron's presence as enough to warrant top dog status. -- Micah Adams, ESPN Stats & Info\n\n2. Boston Celtics\n\nFirst-place votes: 10\n\nTotal points: 143\n\n2016-17: 53-29 (L, East finals)\n\nComments: If the Cavaliers do trade Irving, no team is ready to pounce quite like the Celtics. History will remember the 2017 Eastern Conference finals as a non-competitive five-game series in which the Celtics were clearly out-classed. And yet were it not for Irving delivering a transcendent Game 4 performance with James saddled in foul trouble, it would have been tied 2-2 going back to Boston.\n\nShould they meet again -- with or without Irving -- one can see how swapping out Avery Bradley for Gordon Hayward might be enough to swing the pendulum in Boston's favor. If Jaylen Brown develops and rookie Jayson Tatum hits, Boston's perimeter suddenly looks spry, switchy and far more imposing. Perhaps that's what the 10 members of our expert panel who picked the Celtics see playing out. -- Adams\n\n3. Washington Wizards\n\nFirst-place votes: 0\n\nTotal points: 33\n\n2016-17: 49-33 (L, East semis)\n\nComments: Washington's two major moves this offseason consisted of inking John Wall to his new super max and matching Brooklyn's max offer to Otto Porter Jr. For now, their path to contention is banking on the continued development of their young pieces.\n\nPorter is an advanced stats darling, ranking sixth last season in Real Plus-Minus among small forwards (ahead of Gordon Hayward and Paul George) while leading the Wizards in Wins Shares ahead of both Wall and Bradley Beal, both of whom enjoyed career seasons. Kelly Oubre revamped his shot over the summer and will need to improve to keep the bench units afloat, especially after losing Bojan Bogdanovic in free agency.\n\nThe Wizards' starting lineup logged 1,347 minutes, nearly 500 more than any other five-man lineup in the NBA, and posted a scoring margin equal to that of a 60-win team. Every other Wizards lineup, even those featuring four starters and a single reserve, combined to perform at the level of a 37-win team. -- Adams", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "wgt": 100, "id": 301, "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc", "id": "216991"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314838", "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_forward", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319678", "label": {"eng": "Small forward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wall_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329069", "label": {"eng": "John Wall (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "329076", "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "334252", "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "346404", "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermax_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "374487", "label": {"eng": "Supermax prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "389202", "label": {"eng": "Avery Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "392308", "label": {"eng": "Otto Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "392642", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojan_Bogdanovi\u0107", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "488988", "label": {"eng": "Bojan Bogdanovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1126832", "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270415", "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1289410", "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}]}

James has played coy with his long-term plans, and allowed speculation that he intends to leave for Los Angeles to continue to grow. In doing so, he's forced Cleveland to consider how any personnel decisions might play into the vacuum his departure would inevitably create.\n\nNo decision is bigger than the Irving trade, and given the framework the Cavaliers have created for themselves, any deal they construct must yield the type of talent that can help them build for a bright future, and not simply re-tool around James. In Boston, flush with talent across the developmental spectrum and an array of future draft picks, they see a partner that could potentially provide both. Per Woj:\n\nBoston has expressed interest in Irving and could offer the best combination of short-term (Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder) and long-term (Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, picks) assets. The Celtics have made no formal offer, and it is against Boston's front-office DNA to push out front with the most generous offer. Boston knows that Cleveland is mostly intrigued with Tatum, but the sides have not formally discussed that deal, league sources said.\n\nWe've touched on this before, but that kind of package (Thomas, Crowder, a young piece, and/or a pick) seems too much to surrender, and the fact of the matter is that the Celtics have too many players on good salaries to make the math work without giving up more than is palatable in a deal.\n\nUnless Boston has reason to believe that Thomas' production is about to fall off of a cliff due to age or injury, AND that any pick or prospect they ship out doesn't have a ceiling close to Irving's, then nothing makes sense.\n\nThat doesn't mean Danny Ainge won't stay abreast of any developments. He's looking for every possible opportunity to improve the team, and a deal of this magnitude, holds the potential to re-shape the landscape of the entire conference. If Ainge feels he has a role to play in making it happen, or keeping it from happening for that matter, he won't hesitate to do so.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100, "id": 542, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100, "id": 722, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc", "id": "209299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc", "id": "228323"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304126", "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305867", "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307496", "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330511", "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "352665", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "356442", "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "384776", "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jae_Crowder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "389203", "label": {"eng": "Jae Crowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270415", "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}]}

And that's only half of the equation.\n\nWould he likely stay with them or want out after one or two seasons?\n\nIf he wasn't happy in Cleveland, would he be happy in his next city and for how long?\n\nWhat's the deal with that flat earth stuff?\n\nOK, so maybe that one is down the list. But teams do have to weigh what's stranger. That or wanting to walk away from the NBA's best player and a trip to a fourth consecutive NBA Finals.\n\nThe Cavs, too, have to decide on the best path. Do they bolster the team in what could be James final season?\n\nDo they ask for a young dynamic player to replace the young dynamic player they'd be trading? Yes. Can they get both? Doubtful.\n\nA Newsweek story on the Cavs status quo with Irving concludes by suggesting that whatever the reason for the delay in trading Irving it's costing the Cavs time they could be using to get better.\n\nWell, It's August 15. The first game is October 17.\n\nA six-month season is followed by a two-month postseason.\n\nWhat exactly is not yet trading Irving costing the Cavs in mid-August?\n\nMy guess: when teams get ready for camp and see their rosters close up, the competition for Irving will heat up.\n\nAnd when the Cavs think about everybody gathering at LeBron's house for movie nights they might be even more inclined to make a deal.\n\n* ESPN's suggestion the Cavs are proceeding as if James won't be here beyond 2018 is obviously a complicating factor, if true.\n\nAnd as long as LeBron isn't going to commit, how can it not be true?\n\n* The teams on Irving's list might be more generous trade partners if they think he will commit to them long-term.\n\nBut even then few if any have the combination that would answer all of the Cavs needs: an impact veteran who can help beat the Warriors now; a great young player who can take up the mantel if the Cavs lose Irving and James in successive years.\n\n* ESPN says it asked a panel of 44 \"experts\" to weigh in and forecast Team Turmoil for the upcoming NBA season.\n\nThe Cavs received 120 points for first place. The Knicks were second with 69.\n\nThe counter-intuitive synopsis on the Cavs makes note they are still the prohibitive favorites to win the East.\n\nI'm going out on a limb here and siding with the Vegas experts.\n\n* Some of the off season issues mentioned regarding the Cavs turmoil index: LeBron's Instagram posts and sub Tweets, Irving laughing at Steph Curry's LeBron impersonation at a wedding; Dan Gilbert at the White House along with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn other words, an Irving trade request and a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter.\n\n* Hue Jackson seems amused by the media harping on the successes and failures of day-to-day training camp drills and practices.\n\n\"You guys have no clue what we are doing every day or what we are trying to attempt to do,\" Jackson said. \"I have heard it all but, trust me, I laugh at it all based on what you guys have been saying.\"\n\nHe may have a point. But after the Cody Kessler draft, Jackson might not want to go back to the expression \"trust me\" so soon.\n\n* Brock Osweiler is in line to start against the Giants Monday, though the official word hasn't come.\n\nIf picking a starting quarterback in games that don't matter constitutes an \"official\" decision.\n\n* Odell Beckham Jr. is still making incredible one-handed catches. But what's different is he's acting as if he's found nirvana with the Giants.\n\n\"I'm just in a different place,\" he told the media. \"I don't even know how to explain it. I don't even feel like I'm here sometimes. My mind is just out there.\"\n\nAnswering the question, \"What is the sound of one hand catching a football?\"\n\n* Pablo Sandoval is back with the Giants.\n\nVia the Players Tribune, he conveniently attributed his lack of success in Boston to his heart still being in San Francisco during his two plus years with the Sox.\n\nNice try.\n\nAs a reminder, here's what he said when he didn't re-sign with San Francisco in 2014:\n\n\"The Giants made a good offer, but I didn't want to take it,\" he told Bleacher Report. \"I got five years (and $95 million) from Boston. I left money on the table in San Francisco. It is not about money. It is about how you treat the player.\"\n\nAsked then if it was hard to leave the Giants, he said it \"wasn't hard at all.\"\n\nDoubtful he left his heart in San Francisco, but he definitely left his swing there and hasn't found it upon his return.\n\nExcept for winning the Super Bowl. That time came and went last February.\n\n* Dennis Rodman says when he played for the Spurs that Gregg Popovich \"hated me.\"\n\nBut that was before Pop knew Rodman was an international diplomat who could keep the world safe from a North Korean nuclear attack.\n\nSleep well, my friends.\n\n* Rodman said on the radio program \"Undeniable\" that he didn't hit it off with Popovich, who was the Spurs GM at the time.\n\n\"The city kind of embraced me, but what's his name, Popovich, he hated me,\" Rodman said. \"He hated my guts because I wasn't a bible guy. They looked at me like I was the devil.\"\n\nTwo things: maybe referring to Pop as \"whatsyourname\" affected their relationship.\n\nSecondly, I'm pretty sure nobody in the NBA ever looked at Rodman and said, \"That fellow would be the complete package if only he were a Bible guy.\"\n\n* The Cubs trolled White Sox announcer Hawk Harrelson for saying Wrigley Field was a dump and that he would never set foot in there again.\n\nA Cubs-Indians World Series rematch is greatly anticipated. And that's only for the Twitter competition.\n\n* Dennis Smith Jr., who was drafted by the Mavericks, told the New York Daily News that during a pre-draft dinner with Knicks president Phil Jackson the group pressured him to eat octopus.\n\nThey then passed on Smith in the draft.\n\nKnowing Jackson's reputation, maybe it was because Smith didn't think to smoke a peace pipe with the octopus before consuming it?\n\n* The University of Florida suspended seven players for the season opener against Michigan.\n\nThat sounds like a lot unless you're the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nAnd that satisfies my quota of one gratuitous Cowboys shot per column.\n\n* No word on whether Cowboys owner Jerry Jones will contest Ezekiel Elliott's six-game suspension for domestic violence.\n\nESPN reported Jones was \"furious\" with the league's decision. He had predicted Elliott would not get suspended.\n\nHe was also in favor of drafting Johnny Manziel. So he's on a roll.\n\n* Texans defensive end Jadeveon Clowney says he was inspired to have his best season to date after hearing someone call him the \"biggest bust of all time.\"\n\nAnd you thought being the No. 1 overall pick and getting $22 million guaranteed might be enough incentive.\n\nDon't tell Clowney he's not even the biggest bust in his draft class. He might take that as a reason to have a bad year.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"},

That means teams that once merely inquired about the point guard could become bigger players in trade rumors.\n\nOne intriguing team in that regard is the Toronto Raptors, and general manager Bobby Webster told reporters that the team did indeed ask about Irving's availability.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 100, "id": 723, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "219173"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "304123", "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304127", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304131", "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316225", "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "321241", "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323679", "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gilbert_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "499853", "label": {"eng": "Dan Gilbert (businessman)"}}]}

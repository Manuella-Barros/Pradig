{"id": 237098746, "title": "Sir Ian McKellen expected to return to West End stage this week after fall", "text": "The British actor has shown little sign of slowing down during his esteemed career, even marking his milestone 80th year with a 80-date nationwide solo tour. With two Oscar nominations, Sir Ian has gripped audiences both on screen and on stage and is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time. Most recently, Sir Ian has been seen playing John Falstaff in Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre in London. During Monday\u2019s performance, the veteran actor fell from the stage but has since been told he will make a \u201cspeedy and full recovery\u201d and is expected to appear in Wednesday\u2019s matinee performance of the production. During his career, Sir Ian\u2019s largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. The role won him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor during the 2002 ceremony. It marked his second Oscar nod, having been nominated three years previously for his role as James Whale in Bill Condon\u2019s period drama Gods And Monsters. Sir Ian also found mainstream success with his performances as Magneto in the X-Men series and as the title character in the film adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s Richard III. On the stage, Sir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage. The actor was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and father Denis. Sir Ian has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: \u201cApparently she said, \u2018If Ian decides to be an actor, it\u2019s a good job, because it brings pleasure to people\u2019.\u201d His mother died when he was just 12 and he would lose his father at the age of 22. Sir Ian acted at all the schools he attended. When at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night. He then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir David Frost and Dame Margaret Drabble. By the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. Since then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters. Outside of acting, Sir Ian has been active in the gay rights movement. Very few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents. In 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence. He said of the law: \u201cI think it\u2019s offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.\u201d Section 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003. Sir Ian has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions. Back in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: \u201cThe only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\u201d Then in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \u201cWhat happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\u201d Sir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.", "summary": "<p>Even a fall from the West End stage is not expected to keep 85-year-old Sir Ian McKellen from performing for long.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/sir-ian-mckellen-expected-to-return-to-west-end-stage-this-week-after-fall/a1368487749.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/2nahFfo-N8XVHCX3lKTMHfi8PoU=/0x654:3712x3128/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/ddfe08ed-4f3a-4a9d-8c57-e552037ed461/e3d0ed3e-e3fd-453c-9c92-f180684d96b6/2.39772050.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:15:09", "author": "Ellie Iorizzo And William Warnes, Pa", "authors": ["Ellie Iorizzo And William Warnes, Pa"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.702}

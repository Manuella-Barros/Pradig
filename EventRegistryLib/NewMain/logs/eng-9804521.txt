An anti-racism 'Unity Over Division' counter-protest is scheduled to take place from 4.30pm to 7pm.\n\nOn an event poster shared, organisers have urged people to \"take a stand against racism, facism, and Islamophobia by attending this peaceful counter protest.\"\n\nDetails of a separate far-right protest have been shared on social media. It is expected to take place at City Hall from 5pm this evening.\n\nOn Saturday, an anti-racist rally and march is scheduled to take place. The rally will begin at Writer's Square at 12pm, before marchers proceed to City Hall.\n\nHave any changes been made to public transport ahead of the protests?\n\nTranslink said they will continue to \"liaise closely with the PSNI\" ahead of potential traffic disruption this weekend due to the planned protests in Belfast.\n\nThe transport operator has already announced changes to their Donegall Road Metro bus services, which will divert at 7pm each evening via Grosvenor Road and Westlink until further notice.\n\nLast Saturday, a number of businesses in the Donegall Road area were attacked during disorder, with trouble in the area continuing into this week.\n\nIn a statement, Translink said: \"We liaise closely with the PSNI and will continue to follow their guidance - and any diversionary routes in place.

We are aware of planned protest activity throughout Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We will have a significant policing operation in place, and are working hard to keep everyone safe, while supporting the right to peaceful protest.\n\n\"We would remind everyone that when engaging in protest, they should adhere to the following:\n\nFollow the instructions of Police. Respect the rights of others. Do not endanger your own safety, or that of anyone else. Do not block a roadway or footpath. Do not enter any building as a trespasser, or cause damage to property. If you find yourself in a situation within a large group of people, which feels dangerous, try to leave the area as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe police spokesperson added: \"If the protest involves a parade then this must be notified to the Parades Commission. Taking part in a procession that is not notified is a criminal offence and you may be liable to prosecution.\n\n\"If you participate in disorder, you risk getting arrested. The penalties for being involved in serious disorder can be very high, with rioting carrying a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.\"\n\nAre businesses expected to close in Belfast on Friday evening?\n\nPolice said they are aware of misinformation being shared on social media relating to advice for employers ahead of further protest in the city. However, they said this advice has not been issued by them.\n\nOn Wednesday, Danske Bank on Donegall Square West closed its doors and sent staff home early for fears of disorder. Queen's University Belfast announced it would not be opening on Friday to ensure staff and students are not put at risk.\n\nA number of city centre based businesses have also taken to social media to say they will be staying closed on Friday.\n\nPolice have issued guidance for business owners on safeguarding their business and employees which can be found here.\n\nWhat other events are taking place in Belfast on Friday night?\n\nAs well as the planned protests taking place this evening, it's expected to be a busy evening in the city.\n\nThousands will take to Custom House Square to watch English ska band Madness at ChSq with doors scheduled to open at 6pm.

later today has already led to Queen's University Belfast taking the decision to close its campus.\n\nTwo protests are scheduled to take place later in Belfast city centre.\n\nAn anti-racism 'Unity

of Belfast's bus or rail services have been impacted by events planned for later today.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the public service operator said it would be working closely with the PSNI and would update passengers of any disruption later on social media platforms.\n\nA spokesperson for Translink said: \"We liaise closely with the PSNI and will continue to follow their guidance - and any

circulating on social media regarding advice to employers in Belfast city centre on Friday\".\n\nSo far no significant city centre employers have publicly said they are closing their business as a result of the scheduled protests taking place later.\n\nQueen's University Belfast has however decided to close the campus today.\n\nIn a statement released on social media, the education establishment's president and vice-chancellor, Professor Sir Ian Greer, said the university would be closed as a precautionary measure \"to ensure staff and students travelling to campus are not put at any risk\".\n\nHe also made a direct appeal to young people, advising them not to take part in any disorder or violence should they be putting their future careers at risk.\n\n\"At Queen's, we abhor violence and condemn without reservation islamophobia, racism and xenophobia in all forms,\" he said.\n\nMichelle O'Neill: There is no place for racism in Northern Ireland\n\n\"As a university

The ad for the protest has urged people to \"take a stand against racism, fascism and Islamophobia by attending the peaceful counter protest.\"\n\nFar right protests are also reportedly set to take place at city hall on Friday at 5pm.\n\nOn Saturday, the 'Belfast Welcomes Diversity Demo' is urging people of all backgrounds to take part in the \"vibrant and peaceful\" demonstration which will assemble at Writers' Square at noon and make its way towards City Hall.\n\nThe PSNI have recently released a statement on planned protests, stating: \"We are aware of social media posts calling for protests across Northern Ireland in the week ahead.\n\n\"We urge anyone who plans to attend these protests to engage with us as we will be doing our part to ensure the safety of participants and to facilitate the lawful exercise of freedom of expression.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation and will be engaging with groups likely to be affected by any protest activity.\"\n\nThe PSNI have also confirmed they have called in for reinforcements due to the past week of tension.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Melanie Jones stated: \"As a result of the ongoing street violence and disorder we have seen across Belfast since the weekend the Police Service of Northern Ireland has taken a decision to significantly mobilise the service. Unfortunately this will mean officers and staff working longer shifts and rest days.\n\n\"Increasing our resources and footprint across Northern Ireland in the coming days will enable us to manage planned events and deal with any sporadic incidents, including disorder.\n\n\"We have also submitted a request to the National Police Coordination Centre for additional officers from across the United Kingdom to support the policing operation.\n\n\"The Mutual Aid officers will provide vital resilience and support and will be given all of the necessary equipment and familiarisation training. Any officers who may come to Northern Ireland would specifically assist with the ongoing public disorder and protests and not every day policing. We will continue to keep this under review.\"\n\nExecutive ministers met at Stormont Castle to discuss the violent disorder seen in Belfast. The Stormont Assembly was recalled alongside MLAs for a special sitting.\n\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill has stated ministers are, \"unequivocally collective in our determination to say no to racism.\"\n\nPoliticians have also released statements on the outbreak of violence in a call for peace.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn has stated: \"The violence which has sowed fear in local communities and damaged business is totally unacceptable.\"\n\nDeputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly has also said on the matter: \"We stand united in opposition to all violence, racism and hate.\"\n\nTranslink have stated they will \"liaise closely with the PSNI\" with the possibility of disruption to routes covered by the planned protests, while also stating any changes to their services will be posted on their social media pages.\n\nPolice warned that social media messages reportedly from the PSNI urging employers to allow staff in Belfast city centre to leave work early is \"misinformation\".\n\nA Whatsapp message circulating urged businesses to \"let staff leave by 2pm or earlier\" on Friday ahead of planned protests in the city.\n\nThe message states: \"The PSNI anticipates potential conflict and has recalled constables from annual leave to assist as well as making a request for additional forces from the rest of the UK.\n\n\"The PSNI advises employers to release staff as early as possible, as gatherings are expected to begin earlier than scheduled.\n\n\"It is recommended to let staff leave by 2pm or earlier.\n\n\"All areas are at risk as the PSNI cannot predict where potential conflict may arise.\"\n\nHowever, in a statement on Thursday evening, police said they are \"aware of misinformation circulating on social media regarding advice to employers in Belfast city centre on Friday\".\n\n\"This has not been issued by the Police Service of Northern Ireland,\" a spokesperson said.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Windows were broken in houses in south Belfast and police in east Belfast were attacked on Flora Street by a group of masked men who threw bricks and masonry at officers.\n\nLast weekend Muslim-owned shops and cafes in south Belfast were targeted after anti-immigration protesters staged a counter-rally while an antiracism demonstration was taking place at Belfast City Hall.\n\nFurther protests are due to take place in Belfast city centre on Friday afternoon and an antiracism rally is scheduled for Saturday. The organisers of an antiracism rally in Derry on Wednesday said a further protest planned for Friday had been called off after receiving assurances that an anti-immigration rally had been cancelled.\n\nDuring a media briefing on Friday afternoon, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Melanie Jones said a \"significant uplift\" in resources was being deployed in Belfast city centre.\n\n\"We are aware of two separate protests in the city centre, one from 4.30pm and one from 5pm, and we have tactics and plans in place to make sure that we have good engagement, that we are giving clear instructions to those present, there is an absolute clarity over what is lawful and peaceful, and that we also have plans in place to make sure that there is no burst-out from that protest into what we saw on Saturday,\" she said.\n\nSome businesses did not open in Belfast on Friday and others are expected to close early ahead of the protests, while Queen's University closed its campuses. Ms Jones said police were \"aware of misinformation circulating on social media regarding advice to employees in Belfast\" and that it had not been issued by the PSNI.\n\nShe said it was \"really important\" that businesses were supported and can trade as normal. \"It is entirely their own decision, if they make decisions to close early or to cease services, and I want to reassure people that we have significant policing resources in place.\"\n\nShe said the PSNI has, so far, made 23 arrests in connection with the disorder and that 15 people had been charged. She said further arrests would be made.\n\nAbout 120 additional officers from Police Scotland are expected to arrive on Tuesday, Ms Jones said, and \"from today, our officers may have additional powers to stop and search or require the removal of face coverings\".\n\nShe said the disorder was a \"mixture\" of organised and sporadic violence.\n\n\"We have a separate strand of the criminal investigation strategy which is dedicated to looking at that organisation and orchestration that we know mainly goes on in the online space, and we will make sure we identify those that are committing offences in this regard and that they will be brought to justice,\" she added. \"We also have the sporadic issues around disorder, which we have enough resources in place to deal with quickly and effectively.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police Service of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Centre", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belfast City Centre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast City Centre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_University_Belfast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen's University Belfast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/VVRFUR3LIG5LXKJLL4NU2L7W2M.jpg?smart=true&auth=8c534c5eaafdd9037e669c8c618a4b2e5aa30b5d189690a7a6feb02ca7c01ec6&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804521", "eventUri": "eng-9804521", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

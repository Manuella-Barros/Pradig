That is just a way of taking government land and enriching yourselves at the expense of the government,\" he said.\n\nThe minister added, \"Yes government cannot sell land, so why will the government give out land for the purpose of housing estate and then you are selling the land?\n\n\"The government can as well sell the land itself if that is the case.\"\n\nWike said that to address the challenge, the FCTA had decided that developers must show financial capacity before a land would be allocated to them in FCT.\n\nHe added that a reputable commercial bank must also write an undertaking that the developer has the financial capacity for such development.\n\n\"Two, you will write an undertaking that the project will commence and be completed within a specified time without any condition attached to it.\n\n\"Three, that failure to develop the land, the government is entitled to take back its land.It does not matter what form of development you are putting there.\n\n\"If that is done, then we will be convinced and give you our land allocation with proper documentation,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the measures were necessary to ensure that developers do not steal from the government in the name of development.\n\nThe minister said that there were currently over 1000 litigations in different courts over land matters, with kore being recorded on daily basis.\n\nThe minister also berated real estate developers for not meeting up to their obligations to the government, particularly in the payment of taxes relating to land.\n\n\"Even when you sell your properties, you don't remit part of which belongs to the government.\n\n\"So, I want to partner with you but on good faith, not partnership that one party would be detrimental to the other, no. It has to be mutual and symbiotic,\" Wike said.\n\nEarlier, REDAN Chairman, Dr Ehikioya Okoruwa, assured Wike of the association's readiness to partner the FCTA to bridge housing deficits in the territory.\n\nOkoruwa said that to that end, the association planned to build 15,000 houses.\n\nHe further said that REDAN would invest N262 billion in the housing sector, adding that the FCTA would gain a lot if they supported the project.\n\nOkoruwa said that REDAN was working with security agencies to address land racketeering, emphasising the association's commitment to ethical practices and accountability.\n\n\"This meeting sets the stage for a potential partnership between the FCT Administration and REDAN, but with clear terms and expectations for accountability and transparency,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheNewsGuru"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bayo_millz@thenewsguru.com", "name": "Bayo Millz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_grabbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Land grabbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyesom_Wike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyesom Wike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Title (property)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://thenewsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wike-FCT.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554990", "eventUri": "eng-9554990", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

For me, that is not helping us to reduce the housing deficit, no. That is just a way of taking government land and enriching yourselves at the expense of the government,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the minister, to address the challenge, the FCTA had decided that developers must show financial capacity before land would be allocated to them in FCT.\n\nHe added that a reputable commercial bank must also write an undertaking that the developer has the financial capacity for such development.", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Post Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_atungwu@dailypost.ng", "name": "Matthew Atungwu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_grabbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Land grabbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_(property)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Title (property)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wike.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554990", "eventUri": "eng-9554990", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

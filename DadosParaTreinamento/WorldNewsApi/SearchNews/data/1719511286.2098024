{"id": 223767218, "title": "Home to a \u2018forgotten\u2019 hero, Arrah battle pits BJP\u2019s \u2018labharthi\u2019 politics against Opp&#8217;s jobs pitch, caste manoeuvres", "text": "The Jagdishpur Fort in Bihar\u2019s Arrah Lok Sabha constituency bears markers of the freedom struggle and its local icon Veer Kunwar Singh, the ruler of the erstwhile Jagdishpur principality who led the 1857 rebellion against the British East India Company. His journey, from his seven victories against the Company to when he cut off his right hand and threw it in the Ganga after being shot by the British, is narrated through paintings in the museum housed in the fort. Kunwar Singh\u2019s busts, a statue of him riding his horse, and replicas of his swords are on display at the fort museum. Of late, Jagdishpur has often been invoked by parties and politicians for its symbolism. While the state government has developed the fort and its surrounding areas over the last two decades, some have attempted to reduce Kunwar Singh to a Rajput icon despite his role in the rebellion. Arrah votes in the final phase on June 1. But the deserted house adjoining the fort tells the story of a \u201cforgotten\u201d hero. Until last year it was home to Pushpa Singh, a sixth-generation descendant of Kunwar Singh whose son Bablu died in police custody. Unable to live alone there, Pushpa moved to Patna. She criticises the ruling NDA alliance\u2019s \u201cneglect\u201d of Kunwar Singh\u2019s descendants, calling it an insult to the freedom fighter. Pushpa is disillusioned with all parties. \u201cWe have been used as a political symbol over the years. But I have not yet recovered from the shock of my son\u2019s death,\u201d she told The Indian Express. The BJP\u2019s sitting MP and Union minister R K Singh who is seeking a third-straight term is contending with anti-incumbency. He is up against the CPI(M-L) Liberation\u2019s Sudama Prasad. While Singh is an upper-caste Rajput, Prasad belongs to the OBC Bania community. By fielding Prasad, the INDIA bloc is hoping to split the NDA\u2019s traditional Bania voter base and add to its core base of Muslims and Yadavs, and sections of Dalits and Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs). While there are an estimated 2-2.25 lakh Bania voters in Arrah and almost 2.5 lakh Rajputs, Yadavs are the largest group at 4 lakh, followed by 1.25-1.5 lakh OBC Kushwahas and 1.25 lakh Brahmins. Muslims account for about 2 lakh of the constituency\u2019s 21 lakh total voters. Inside the fort\u2019s complex, large parts of which have been developed like a park, locals across demographic groups, from caste to gender, often congregate for political discussions. The clash between the Centre\u2019s free ration scheme and local caste dynamics \u2014 as is the case in several other constituencies \u2014 is evident here. Local resident Meena Kunwar said, \u201cWhile any other incentive being promised by others could be temporary, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ration scheme is very good. One thing is for sure, we are not going to die of hunger now. My two daughters-in-law have not been getting free ration for some months. We want to restore it to them with the help of some babus (bureaucrats) in Jagdishpur.\u201d Ashok Kumar Choudhary, a daily-wage worker, said, \u201cWhile the Jagdishpur town has seen a muted impact of caste during elections, it is more rigid in villages \u2026 We may be somewhat disappointed with our MP R K Singh but the NDA government has ensured 20-22 hours of daily power supply.\u201d Though Choudhary praised the Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav for talking about jobs, he said the free ration scheme and caste calculations together could decide the outcome in Arrah. Daily wager Mahendra Yadav whose three sons work in stone chip factories outside Bihar said, \u201cWe are traditional RJD voters. But there could be some women from our caste voting for Modi.\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbxB0vowEM&pp=ygUUaW5kaWFuIGV4cHJlc3MgYmloYXI%3D None of the voters The Indian Express spoke to mentioned the legacy of Kunwar Singh as a poll issue but said they were happy that the fort served as an \u201cextended public courtyard\u201d for its neighbourhood. Arrah is among the three seats the CPI(ML)(L) is contesting as part of the INDIA bloc\u2019s seat-sharing deal along with Karakat and Nalanda. In the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the party failed to make much of an impression against R K Singh. But this time, the CPI(M-L)(L) believes its alliance with the RJD and Congress could result in a transfer of votes to Sudama Prasad, who is pitching his campaign as a fight to \u201cprotect the Constitution\u201d and provide jobs. Singh, however, is unperturbed and is banking on the BJP\u2019s development credentials as well as his record as the Union Minister of Renewable Energy. Though Modi has not visited Arrah for a rally, Singh is also seeking votes in the PM\u2019s name. \u201cWe want the continuation of the good work done by the Narendra Modi government,\u201d he said at a rally earlier this month.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/bihar-arrah-bjp-labharthi-politics-opposition-jobs-pitch-caste-9353512/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/kunwar-singh-museum-arrah.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:33:15", "author": "Santosh Singh", "authors": ["Santosh Singh"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.043}

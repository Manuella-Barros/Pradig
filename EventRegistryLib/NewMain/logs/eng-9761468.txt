According to Article 2(1)(a), the AI Act applies to providers placing on the market or putting into service AI systems or GPAI models in the EU, irrespective of whether those providers are established or located within the EU or in a third country.\n\nThe extraterritorial nature of the AI Act is particularly evident in its application to providers and deployers of AI systems established in third countries. Article 2(1)(c) specifically addresses this extraterritorial reach by including providers and deployers of AI systems that have their place of establishment or are located in a third country, where the output produced by the system is used in the EU. This output-based jurisdiction is a key aspect of the AI Act's extraterritorial scope.\n\nRole of Authorised Representatives for Providers Established Outside the EU\n\nA key mechanism for enforcing the extraterritorial reach of the AI Act is the concept of the \"authorised representative.\" An 'authorised representative' is defined under Article 3(5) of the AI Act as a natural or legal person located or established in the EU who has received and accepted a written mandate from a provider of an AI system or a GPAI model who is established in a third country to perform and carry out on its behalf the obligations and procedures established by the AI Act.\n\nThe AI Act distinguishes between authorised representatives for high-risk AI systems (Article 22) and those for GPAI models (Article 54). However, the underlying principle remains the same: ensuring accountability within the EU's jurisdiction.\n\nHigh-Risk AI Systems\n\nArticle 22 of the AI Act mandates that providers of high-risk AI systems established in third countries must appoint an authorised representative in the EU before making their systems available on the EU market. The authorised representative's responsibilities include:\n\nImportantly, Article 22(4) of the AI Act empowers the authorised representative to terminate the mandate if they believe the provider is acting contrary to the AI Act, and requires them to inform the relevant market surveillance authority and notified body about such termination.\n\nGeneral-Purpose AI Models\n\nSimilarly, Article 54 of the AI Act requires providers of GPAI models established in third countries to appoint an authorised representative in the EU. Their responsibilities include verifying technical documentation, providing information to demonstrate compliance, and cooperating with authorities on actions related to the GPAI model.\n\nThese provisions ensure that there is always an entity within the EU's jurisdiction that can be held accountable for compliance with the AI Act, regardless of where the AI system or model originates.\n\nObligations for Providers\n\nArticle 53 of the AI Act outlines specific obligations for providers of GPAI models, which apply regardless of the provider's location. These include maintaining technical documentation, providing information to AI system providers who intend to integrate the model, complying with EU copyright law, and publishing a summary of training content.\n\nContext and Justification\n\nRecital 22 of the AI Act provides crucial context for understanding the extent of the AI Act's extraterritorial application, stating that certain AI systems should fall within the scope of the AI Act even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the EU. This includes scenarios where an EU-based operator contracts services to a third-country operator involving an AI system that would qualify as high-risk.\n\nRecital 106 of the AI Act further extends the extraterritorial reach in the context of copyright compliance, stipulating that providers of GPAI models must comply with EU copyright law, regardless of where the training of these models takes place. This ensures a level playing field among providers, preventing competitive advantages based on less onerous legal obligations applying outside the EU.\n\nImplications for Global AI Governance\n\nThe extraterritorial scope of the AI Act has significant implications for global AI governance. The AI Act's broad reach, along with the requirements for authorised representatives and specific obligations for providers, may encourage non-EU companies and countries to align their AI development and deployment practices with EU standards to maintain access to the EU market. This could potentially lead to the AI Act becoming a de facto global standard for AI regulation.\n\nHowever, these provisions may also create challenges for companies operating across multiple jurisdictions. Non-EU entities will need to carefully assess their AI systems, ensure compliance with the AI Act, establish a presence in the EU through an authorised representative, and meet the various obligations if they intend to serve EU customers or process EU-origin data, even if their AI systems are not directly deployed within the EU.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe extraterritorial scope of the AI Act represents a bold and comprehensive step in regulating AI on a global scale. By extending its reach beyond EU borders, requiring representation for third-country providers, and imposing specific obligations on providers of both high-risk AI systems and GPAI models, the AI Act aims to ensure comprehensive protection for EU citizens and maintain a level playing field for AI providers serving the EU market.\n\nAs the AI Act moves towards implementation, its extraterritorial provisions will likely spark further debate and potentially influence the development of AI governance frameworks worldwide. Stakeholders across the global AI ecosystem must closely monitor these developments and adapt their strategies to navigate this evolving regulatory landscape.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritoriality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extraterritoriality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright law of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterritorial_jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraterritorial jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Consistent with the general approach of the U.S. to technology, AI-related policy must not be overly broad or restrictive. It must leave room for future development and progress of frontier models. At the same time, the U.S. needs to seriously reckon with the national security risks of AI technology. To that end, this report serves as a primer on the history of AI development and the principles that can guide future policymaking.\n\nPart 1 details the recent history of AI and the major policy issues concerning the technology, including the methods of evaluating the strength of AI, controlling AI systems, the possibility of AI agents, and the global competition for AI. Part 2 proposes four key principles that can shape the future of AI and the policies that accompany them. These are:\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT launched on November 30, 2022.[1] In just two months, the chatbot gained approximately 100 million users -- among the fastest product adoptions in the Internet's history. In the following 18 months, many more advanced models were released.\n\nAs this report will detail, there are good reasons to think that artificial intelligence (AI) will continue to progress rapidly. Creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- systems that could perform equal to, or better than, humans in cognitive tasks across domains and could automate much of the economy -- is the stated mission of OpenAI.[2] The CEOs of all the leading AI labs, including Sam Altman of OpenAI, Demis Hassabis[3] of DeepMind, and Dario Amodei[4] of Anthropic, say that they plan for AGI or AGI-like systems before the end of this decade.\n\nIf progress continues, AI could become one of the most consequential technologies in human history. Advanced AI systems could replicate the work of white-collar workers like accountants and data scientists, operate vehicles from cars to military aircraft, conduct scientific research, and make novel discoveries. Access to advanced AI systems may become a decisive economic and strategic advantage.\n\nAlready there are calls to \"regulate AI.\" As of April 2024, lawmakers had introduced more than 680 AI bills on the state and federal levels.[5] Many of these efforts are misplaced and overly broad. Government should not regulate chatbots saying \"bad\" words, nor should they stifle the industry with gratuitous regulation. AI systems have already been part of many technologies for years, without consequence. Every smartphone provider integrates AI into image capture and typing. Many new AI systems will simply be smarter versions of existing software, like file systems that organize themselves or better grammar suggestions in word processing. In these cases, the U.S.'s hands-off approach has been appropriate and successful. More scrutiny would impose needless costs on this developing technology.\n\nIt is imperative that U.S. technologists and labs continue to lead the world in AI development. Therefore, government involvement in AI should focus on threats to national security -- chiefly, those posed by frontier models and AIs built for military applications. Current models have already enabled a wave of cybercrime; future ones will be instrumental military assets.[6]\n\nA good AI policy balances two goals in tension with each other: first, retain the American advantage by supporting our labs and deregulating key bottlenecks; and second, prevent AI companies from compromising our national security and public safety. Pursuing those goals would also rapidly integrate and employ AI advances in government and defense.\n\nGood policy is an urgent need, as both the technology and legislative debate are advancing rapidly. In June 2023, Missouri senator Josh Hawley introduced his guiding principles for regulating AI;[7] in October 2023, the Biden administration issued a wide-ranging executive order on AI;[8] and in late 2023, a bipartisan group of four senators hosted nine \"AI Insight forums.\"[9] In March 2024, Reps. Anna Eshoo and Neal Dunn released legislation targeted at deepfakes;[10] and Senator Mitt Romney and some of his colleagues released a \"Framework for Mitigating Extreme AI Risks\" in April.[11] Donald Trump called AI \"the most dangerous thing out there\" earlier this year.[12] The public is taking notice, too. Recent polling from AI Policy Institute suggests that a plurality of voters now believe that AI is an \"extremely important\" issue in public policy.[13]\n\nLawmakers will need to address the national security issues created by AI, but stifling the U.S. AI industry is anathema to any reasonable goal. By focusing only on national security and other acute issues, such as deepfake fraud and nonconsensual pornography, we can leave as large an area for experimentation and development as possible.\n\nIt will be decisive for national security that the U.S. retains a lead on frontier AI, which means supporting the U.S.'s continued leadership in AI through investments in energy and infrastructure, while also ensuring that top AI labs are secure against foreign infiltration and espionage.\n\nIn Part 1 of this report, I summarize recent AI advances and relevant issues for AI policymaking. In Part 2, I suggest a framework of principles and associated policies that the next administration should take on AI.\n\nFor many years, \"AI\" was used as a marketing term, disconnected from real developments. Depending on how broadly \"artificial intelligence\" was defined, practitioners could point to any number of software applications, from autocorrect to spam filters.\n\nFundamentally, AI is about automating cognitive labor. Just as a flour mill automates labor by having a machine take over the physical task of grinding grains into flour, freeing up the human baker for other tasks, AI automates labor by having a machine take over cognitive tasks from a human being.\n\nEarly \"AI\" systems were simply complex series of rules or simple math and statistics. Calculators, for example, used automated cognitive labor in a very narrow sense. Spam filters, much later, automated the identification of spam using statistics algorithms, considering the likelihood of an e-mail being spam or not spam, given each word used in the e-mail.\n\nThe recent breakthroughs in AI are powered by \"machine learning,\" techniques that allow a computer to learn by processing data. In particular,\"deep learning\" (a subset of machine learning) uses artificial neural networks that are many layers deep, using vast amounts of computing power and data.[14]\n\nIn the mid-2010s, deep learning efforts began to take off with a string of major successes, a decade before ChatGPT brought public attention to the field. AlexNet, a breakthrough model in 2012, was able to recognize images with a far higher degree of accuracy than any earlier system.[15] Now undergraduate computer-science students build AIs that can accurately recognize, for example, whether an image has a dog in it -- something virtually impossible before 2010. The technology advanced rapidly from there (Figure 1). In 2016, Google DeepMind's AlphaGO beat the Go world champion, applying similar techniques to a very different domain.[16] Less than a year later, its successor AlphaZero was able to achieve superhuman play and beat the world champion AIs (and human players) in Go, chess, and shogi within 24 hours.\n\nThe most recent AI developments have come in the form of large language models, or LLMs, trained on huge quantities of words. LLMs improved from basically useless to highly capable in a matter of a few years. When GPT-2 was released in 2019, its summaries were not much better than pulling random sentences from an article. When GPT-3.5 powered ChatGPT three years later, it was highly useful for tasks, from summarization to computer programming.[17] For the first time, casual users were able to query the AI and get useful help on a wide range of tasks.\n\nIn March 2023, less than 12 months after ChatGPT's release, OpenAI released its next generation LLM, GPT-4,[18] and many more companies joined the race with their own LLMs. These include Facebook's Llama-2, Anthropic's Claude 2, and Google's Gemini. GPT-4 was far more generally capable than its predecessor, GPT-3.5: it went from the 40th percentile on the LSAT to the 88th, from the 25th percentile on the quantitative section of the GRE to the 80th (Table 1).[19] In five years, LLMs evolved from glimmers of semantic comprehension to, in the words of its creators, \"sparks of artificial general intelligence.\"[20]\n\nTable 1\n\nPerformance on Standardized Tests, Percentile Compared with Human Test-Takers\n\nSince GPT-4's release, AI progress has continued. In January 2024, DeepMind used a modified LLM, AlphaGeometry, to complete International Math Olympiad problems, written for the smartest mathematics students around the world.[21] It solved 25/30, just shy of the gold-medal level. In March 2024, Anthropic released Claude 3 Opus, which, by some accounts, is the first model to surpass GPT-4.[22]\n\nProgress is so rapid that creators of benchmarks -- tests designed to measure AI systems' capabilities -- have a hard time keeping up. Through GPT-4, the central benchmark for leading AI systems was Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), a data set of 10,000 high school and college test questions across 57 subjects.[23] However, now that GPT-4 exceeds 86% across these high school and college tests (by contrast, GPT-2's performance was essentially random chance), this tool is far less useful.\n\nCurrently, one of the few benchmarks that is even difficult enough to provide a calibrated measurement of state-of-the-art models is the Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark (GPQA),[24] which contains biology, physics, and chemistry questions at a PhD level. Experts who have PhDs in the relevant domain get 70%-80% accuracy. However, PhDs in an adjacent domain, even with the ability to spend more than 30 minutes with Google and the web, only get around 35% accuracy (barely above randomly picking one multiple-choice option). Claude 3 Opus can score up to 59.5%[25] -- not far from expert PhDs.\n\nTo many AI researchers, these advances are no surprise. In fact, they were suggested by the \"scaling laws\" of AI,[26] which predict AI progress, given the size of an AI, the amount of data that it trains on, and the computing power used in that training. These laws have a staggering implication: by simply \"scaling up\" current methods, with more size, data, and computing power, stronger AIs will continue to be produced.[27] This is the trend that we have already seen from GPT-2 to GPT-4: a system that could barely babble to one that can score in the 90th percentile on the SATs in three years.[28]\n\nScaling laws suggest that highly advanced AIs -- even ones that we might call true artificial general intelligence -- might arrive without fundamental breakthroughs. According to surveys of AI experts, many researchers have become more convinced that \"high level machine intelligence\"[29] (HLMI) will arrive soon, and they are shortening their time-frame estimates in subsequent surveys (Figure 2). Leaders of labs seem to be even more bullish, with most stating the possibility of HLMI or AGI being created within the decade.\n\nThe power of scaling suggests that AI labs are poised to make leaps as dramatic as the one from GPT-2 to GPT-4 in the next five years. Qualitatively, that could mean something like a jump from the knowledge of a smart high schooler to a leading professor in the field. Not only will models themselves get smarter, but they will also be employed more effectively. Rather than simply being a chatbot, these models are beginning to be integrated into larger systems that give them tools like increased memory, the ability to act autonomously, and the ability to spend more time considering difficult problems.\n\nLabs are making extraordinary investments to realize this possibility. Amazon recently purchased a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania for $650 million. Even more staggering, OpenAI and Microsoft are rumored to be planning to create a $100 billion supercomputer,[30] which would be among the largest capital investments ever made by a private company, rivaling the cost of the International Space Station. The scale and nature of these investments strongly suggest that the concept of sustained, accelerated AI advancement is not merely an academic speculation but a highly plausible, if not probable, near-future scenario.\n\nAdvanced LLMs can be called \"broadly capable AIs,\" referring to the fact that they can complete a wide range of tasks, from writing code to editing papers to playing games. Broadly capable AIs can be distinguished from \"narrow\" AI systems, useful for assisting in specific tasks, such as breast cancer detection or facial recognition, but incapable of generalizing to other problems. Other narrow AIs specialize in translation, facial identification, chess playing, protein folding, and image generation.\n\nNarrow AI systems are largely continuous with current trends in computer software. In most cases, they should remain largely unregulated. In certain cases, such as medical, financial, and legal advice, narrow AI systems could, if necessary, be regulated within existing regimes.\n\nTwo classes of AI systems require scrutiny. The first is narrow AI systems that are designed for military and intelligence purposes or could be weaponized. The second is advanced, broadly capable AI systems, which may intentionally or inadvertently contain capabilities with great military or other national security implications. Because these models have such a wide range of capabilities, their potential offensive applications are numerous: they could be used for developing further weapons technologies, planning attacks, allowing drones and other vehicles to operate autonomously, implementing cyberattacks, and more. Broadly capable AIs could also have military-adjacent applications that are useful to hostile governments, including the spread of political propaganda, the proliferation of systems like advanced facial recognition that are deployed for political oppression, and assisting in money laundering and cybercrime, among other things. Not only do these increase the risk of direct conflict, but highly autonomous AI systems could introduce further, unintended impacts.\n\nPerhaps the key fact to know about modern, broadly capable AI systems is that nobody -- including the researchers who create them -- knows the exact capabilities that a new AI will have. Scaling laws predict the general strength of an AI, in a measure known as the loss function; but we do not know how much better a next-generation AI will perform at various tasks until it is made and tested[31] -- part and parcel with the deep learning approach. You do not know exactly what an AI has learned in its training process.\n\nTherefore, a new field of AI evaluations (often referred to as \"evals\") has emerged. These evaluations consist of interfacing with an AI to test its abilities, both in terms of how it could be useful and how it could be potentially harmful. Conducting high-quality safety evaluations was a key part of the national and international agenda agreed upon in the Bletchley Declaration,[32] the statement on AI risks and opportunities signed by countries that attended the U.K.'s AI Safety Summit in November 2023. Signatories include the U.S., the U.K., and China.\n\nThe ecosystem for evaluations is rapidly evolving, and how exactly it will be structured remains unclear. Generally speaking, evaluations are first conducted within AI developers' labs, as they test their new models. The evaluations are usually later \"red-teamed\" by nonprofit partners, meaning that they attempt to use the AI system for nefarious acts and detect vulnerabilities or opportunities for malicious use. Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR) is one of the most prominent of these partners, working with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.[33] When GPT-4 and Claude were released, METR piloted evaluations of those models' ability to write phishing e-mails, hire humans to solve Captchas, and autonomously replicate themselves, among other things.[34] Labs may also work with industry-specific evaluation partners. For example, OpenAI worked with the biosecurity consultancy Gryphon Scientific to test GPT-4's capabilities on biological weapon design and creation tasks.[35]\n\nGovernment agencies like the new U.S. and U.K. AI Safety Institutes, as well as the EU AI Office, are becoming involved in the evaluations, especially those involving sensitive or classified information, either directly or through their contractors. As future AI systems will become key national security assets, evaluations will be a crucial starting point for understanding when and how models can be employed or should have their proliferation limited.\n\nBecause broadly capable AIs bring with them new applications, each generation of AI has the potential to introduce new military possibilities, which is a key risk of AI development -- that a new AI proliferates impactful offensive capabilities, perhaps without even the knowledge or intention of its maker. Evaluations are the primary way by which that risk can be mitigated.\n\nAIs are currently modified to prevent bad behavior and to act in accordance with their users' wishes and makers' goals in a process known as reinforcement learning via human feedback (RLHF). In the RLHF process, humans grade the output of AIs on how well the outputs fulfill defined goals. For example, Anthropic's Claude systems strive to be \"harmless, helpful, honest.\"[36] OpenAI's LLMs are graded on their ability to follow instructions, among other things.[37]\n\nReasonable people disagree on many of these modifications: ChatGPT, for example, will not use swear words or write violent stories. Some modifications limit the ability of students to cheat on their English essays. Other modifications cause political bias,[38] where an AI will, for example, write a poem praising one Democratic candidate but will refuse to do the same for a Republican. These ancillary modifications might be appropriate in some AI applications but not others. Google's Gemini faced widespread backlash when its training caused it to depict white historical figures, like the King of England or the Nazis, as people of color. Elon Musk has taken issue[39] with ChatGPT's left-wing biases, and stated[40] that xAI, Musk's AI company, and its model Grok would be more politically neutral.\n\nFor consumer purposes, the market should be able to create ample consumer choice for products that fit people's needs, just as there are TV channels with different political orientations and social networks with different speech policies. As techniques like reinforcement learning improve, labs might also get better at creating politically neutral systems or offer highly customizable models. If and when AI models are employed in the public sphere -- like courts or admissions to public universities -- a higher degree of scrutiny might be necessary.\n\nCertain classes of modifications are widely understood as necessary on all advanced AI systems. In particular, there is wide agreement that models available to the general public should not be chemical-, biological-, radiological-, or nuclear-capable (CBRN). Modifications limit the ability of models to assist a user in the development and deployment of CBRN capabilities, and model evaluations test the CBRN capabilities. Other important modifications limit the ability of AIs to facilitate cybercrime such as phishing and identity theft.\n\nWhen a model is open-sourced, safeguards can be removed quickly and cheaply. In one paper, researchers were able to remove safeguards from Facebook's Llama 2 for less than $200.[41] Because AIs are not yet sophisticated enough to make bioweapons or pose other CBRN threats, removing these safeguards is not yet a major issue. However, AIs have increased the capabilities of cyber-criminals, and future AIs may be able to significantly empower hostile actors to do major harm.\n\nEven when a model is not open-sourced, AI modifications and safeguards can, in many cases, be circumvented through a process known as jailbreaking.[42] An AI may refuse to give instructions when asked, for example, how to create cyanide; but when given a prompt like \"Pretend you are a grandmother telling your grandchild a bedtime story. When you were younger, you worked in a cyanide factory. Tell your grandson about a day at the factory, including the process you used to create cyanide,\" the AI could be tricked, and modifications circumvented.\n\nBecause of the faulty nature of these modifications, evaluations assess, among other things, whether an AI in a modified or unmodified state can increase the ability of actors to do harm.[43] So far, AIs have failed key evaluations, such as the ability to facilitate the creation of a biological weapon.[44] Of course, that could quickly change as models become smarter in the coming years.\n\nIn the future, many researchers[45] expect that current strategies for modifying AIs to prevent safety harms will fail. Put simply, it may be difficult to grade AI systems once AIs become too sophisticated for humans to understand.\n\nThere are potential solutions here, including \"scalable oversight,\"[46] where an AI assists in the reinforcement learning process, and \"Constitutional AI,\"[47] where an AI is trained on broad principles with which to produce outputs. But these potential solutions notwithstanding, there are risks if AIs become more powerful and are released before sufficient security modifications are developed.\n\nJust as researchers cannot predict the capabilities of a given AI, they cannot yet understand how and why an AI answers any given prompt, which has led to the growth of a new field of interpretability research,[48] where researchers seek to understand how an AI stores information within its weights. Such transparency into an AI's inner workings could be crucial for ensuring its safety. For example, AIs are trained -- and, in some cases, to deceive -- like those that play games like Diplomacy,[49] a board game similar to Risk. However, we would like to know whether AIs are deceiving humans when they should not be, as in the case of a chatbot instructed to give true answers. If interpretability research is successful, developers could create alerts to warn researchers and users of false statements, hallucinations, and other undesirable deceptions.\n\nMost people have primarily interacted with AIs as chatbots: they ask questions and the AI responds, which has created the perception that AIs cannot make decisions, work autonomously, or exercise agency. Instead, they are seen more akin to a faulty oracle.\n\nThis perception is increasingly incorrect. Chatbots are one medium in which AIs are deployed, but far from the only one. Consider other AIs like AlphaGo, which makes autonomous decisions as to which chess piece to move and where to move it, according to which move will be best for winning the game. Whether that counts as \"making a decision\" can be left to the philosophers; but at least in chess and many other areas, AIs act autonomously. Even chatbots make decisions, as when ChatGPT decides that it does not know enough to answer a question and does a web search to glean more information.\n\nMoreover, agency is widely understood to be the next frontier of AI. Transforming GPT systems into autonomous agents is a key priority at OpenAI.[50] Devin, a new product from Cognition Labs, is an AI software engineer.[51] Cognition Labs claims that it can successfully execute long-term projects that require thousands of decisions. Note that there has been a large influx of engineering talent into the AI space since broadly capable AIs became widely available: 70% of the companies from the summer cohort of Y Combinator, the top startup accelerator, were AI companies.[52] Many of these companies and hundreds of other top new entrants every year are attempting to build features like agency on top of broadly capable AI systems.\n\nWhile these efforts are still in their infancy, it seems very possible that within the next five years, AI capabilities will be unlocked to enable full-fledged AI agents, something like a remote worker: rather than just having a short dialogue with them, you'll be able to ask them to do complex tasks over a period of weeks, and these AI systems will be able to go away, use a computer, correspond with other humans, write a draft, write code, and do whatever is necessary to get the task done.\n\nThe current obstacles to agency may not be fundamental to AI, but instead a consequence of the current abilities of LLMs. It is likely that, like other shortcomings of current AIs, the models are insufficiently powerful to operate in the complexity of the real world. Due to their current lack of sophistication, the models make too many mistakes. While their chance of making a mistake in a single task might be relatively low -- because longer, autonomous tasks require many steps -- each step introduces the possibility of a devastating mistake that inhibits performance. In turn, that means that the predictable improvement of LLMs with scale could improve accuracy sufficiently to enable longer-horizon agency. Like so many other aspects of AI, agency might be an emergent capability that comes more quickly than we expect.\n\nThere is no particular reason to expect AI progress to stop at the human level. For example, DeepMind's AlphaGo was trained, first to imitate the best human game-play in Go and, in a second stage, to play against itself and continue improving via reinforcement learning. The result was an AI system that surpassed even the best humans at the game of Go -- something that had been thought to be impossible, or at least decades away.\n\nWhile LLMs are currently trained on Internet text (i.e., to imitate human text), leading AI labs are rumored to be investing heavily in research on techniques, such as \"self-play\" or reinforcement learning, that would let these models go beyond simple human imitation. For example, a coding model might first be trained on large amounts of human-written code and, in a second phase, learn via trial and error, writing code and having another model evaluate, grade, and correct that code. If successful, these techniques would enable LLMs to rapidly progress beyond the human level.\n\nSuperhuman AI systems might pose qualitatively new national security risks. Where an AI as good as the best human hackers worsens a well-understood risk, a superhuman AI could fundamentally change the nature of cybersecurity.\n\nMoreover, there are novel challenges for controlling superhuman AI systems. Strategies like large-scale reinforcement learning mean that the AI system is trained by trial and error and might be at greater risk of developing unintended behaviors. Importantly, existing techniques for controlling AI behavior -- particularly, reinforcement learning from human feedback -- are widely acknowledged to break down for superhuman models. If and when broadly capable superhuman AGIs are made possible, it will be critical for national security to ensure that developers have sufficiently sophisticated techniques to maintain the safety and security of these models.\n\nThe path to advanced AI systems is already becoming the defining arms race of our time. AI will likely become the single key military technology. It could, in effect, increase the force size deployed via autonomous systems. At the same time, it could advise in planning and execution, replicating the work of top generals. Advanced AIs could also assist in the research, development, and deployment of further new weapons systems.\n\nThe U.S. military is preparing for these possibilities. The Pentagon has at least 800 unclassified AI-related projects.[53] Army General Mark Milley estimated that artificial intelligence will be \"optimized for command and control of military operations\" in 10-15 years.[54] Military programs like Replicator aim to create thousands of autonomous weapons systems in the next two years.[55] It is clear among insiders and military analysts that the U.S. will have lethal, fully autonomous weapons within a few years.\n\nGeopolitical opponents of the U.S., foremost among them China, are investing in AI-powered military systems. China has demonstrated its ability to build advanced AIs in LLMs, including Kimi and Yi-34. China is investing heavily in integrating AI into its military systems as well.[56]\n\nThere is no responsible approach to AI that allows our adversaries to win. All domestic policy regarding AI must consider the risk of the U.S. losing its technological dominance.[57] Not only will the proliferation of advanced AI systems enable great force projection; it will also allow authoritarian states to create internal surveillance states and dictatorial control.\n\nAs we have seen, there are two key problems in AI, somewhat at odds with each other. The U.S. must continue to lead in AI, and doing so will require deregulation, investment in AI research, and rapid integration of AI systems into the military and other parts of government. At the same time, actions of top AI companies could imperil American AI leadership or create new national security risks.\n\nTo lead in AI, the U.S. will need to tremendously increase our baseload energy production through an \"all of the above\" approach to domestic energy production. We will also need to reform permitting systems to build data centers on an unprecedented scale. We need to ensure that any AI regulation is minimally burdensome and focuses only on key risk points. We will also need to fund neglected areas of AI research and procure advanced AI systems.\n\nTo combat risks, the U.S. will need to control the export of AIs, computing power, data, and technical secrets to hostile foreign entities. Beyond export controls, the government must ensure that labs do not allow themselves to be infiltrated or hacked by foreign governments or non-state actors, and the U.S. must ensure that AIs developed by American labs are not inadvertently dangerous or harmful.\n\nThe U.S. government must understand AI and be prepared to move quickly in the event of an AI-related crisis. This process will begin with building AI evaluation capacity with the U.S. government and its partners. But it could also require a new agency or coordinating body to unite insights across the Departments of Commerce and Energy and the intelligence community, the military, and other key players in order to ensure that AI benefits all Americans.\n\nOne dangerous but common view is that AI will simply be inconsequential, like other once-exciting new technologies. That is simply no longer likely. AI is advancing rapidly. The U.S. government and its policymakers must take action now to prepare. Part 2 of this report proposes a framework of principles and associated policies that could be a first step in that direction.\n\nGiven the history, prospects, and risks of AI development discussed in Part 1, I next consider four principles that must guide the future of AI policymaking. These principles are only detailed sketches, but lawmakers and crafters of policy can use them as a starting point.\n\nThe four necessary principles of AI policymaking discussed in this report include:\n\nThe U.S. currently leads the world in AI development. The most advanced models to date -- OpenAI's GPT 4o, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro -- were all created in the United States. This lead is a boon for the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage. We can retain and enhance that advantage through two primary mechanisms: by curtailing the efforts of foreign adversaries to gain AI supremacy; and by supporting the domestic AI industry.\n\nThe U.S. cannot retain its technological leadership in AI if key AI secrets are not secure. Right now, labs are highly vulnerable to hacking or espionage. If labs are penetrated, foreign adversaries can steal algorithmic improvements and other techniques for making state-of-the-art models.[58]\n\nThat risk is not theoretical. On March 6, 2024, a former Google engineer, Linwei Ding, was arrested in Newark, California, for allegedly stealing more than 500 files of confidential information and trade secrets pertaining to the development of AI.[59] In the prosecutor's words, these constituted the \"building blocks\" of Google's AI infrastructure.\n\nSafeguarding these secrets will curb U.S. adversaries more effectively than policies that are currently being enacted, like export controls for advanced AI chips. Where more advanced chips lend marginal advantages to model development, stealing two years of algorithmic improvements could easily lead to order-of-magnitude model improvements at no additional cost. For example, on ImageNet, a popular computer-vision AI for which public data are available, algorithmic improvements halve computing requirements every nine months.[60]\n\nExport controls provide a model for safeguarding algorithmic secrets. The U.S. technology export control regime is administered via a two-level system. Weapons and technologies developed specifically for military ends are regulated by the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which the Department of State administers. Controls on \"dual-use\" technologies, which are primarily developed for the commercial market but which also have important defense applications, are governed by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the Department of Commerce.[61] ITAR standards are generally stricter. For instance, all employees working with ITAR-controlled technologies must be U.S. persons, and any foreign transmission of related technical data or services is prohibited without prior approval.\n\nDue to the burdensome nature of these regulations and the ample commercial applications of AI technology, ITAR is not an ideal fit to secure AI companies. Labs depend on foreign AI researchers and often have only limited business dealings with defense contractors or military clients. Similarly, ITAR does not focus on cybersecurity, and cyber-espionage might be a greater risk to labs than employee-based espionage, the recent example of Linwei Ding notwithstanding.[62]\n\nEAR is a more natural tool to defend U.S. AI technology against foreign exploitation. However, significant reforms to EAR, and to BIS, which administers and enforces EAR, are necessary to meet the needs of the modern AI industry.\n\nBIS must develop new export regulations applicable to companies developing advanced AI systems with substantial defense and military applications. These standards must consider that advanced AI systems will have more military and defense applications than typical dual-use technologies; yet the development of these systems depends on foreign talent. These standards must also require that labs adhere to cybersecurity standards consistent with, or more stringent than, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-171,[63] in order to ensure that these lab secrets cannot be easily attained through state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n\nBeyond these new export regulations, BIS must also upgrade its processes to ensure that their controls work. BIS must update its IT and use modern information technology to track exports. BIS licensing must factor in cybersecurity preparedness, as highly vulnerable systems render controls unenforceable. Finally, it must aggressively utilize its existing powers to add affiliates of hostile governments to its entity list, so that export controls are not easily subverted.\n\nHuman capital is perhaps the most vital resource for the U.S. to maintain global leadership in AI and to develop safe and innovative technology solutions. The U.S. can draw on both domestic and foreign talent, as shown in Figure 3. But there are especially plentiful opportunities to draw on foreign talent in AI, by which American labs can both increase the speed of their AI development and hamper competitors.\n\nPipelines for foreign talent are currently impeded by prohibitive immigration requirements for highly skilled AI researchers. These restrictions cause U.S. labs to lose top AI talent to other nations, including adversarial ones. This obstacle can be addressed through careful reform of high-skilled immigration policies.\n\nImmigration to the U.S. has been crucial for the development of AI technology. Approximately two-thirds of PhD students in AI and machine-learning programs are international students, with 90% of them taking a job in the U.S. after graduating and 80% remaining after five years.[64] While American-born graduate-student enrollment has stagnated since 1990, international students have filled that gap, providing much-needed human resources to an industry in dire need of talent.\n\nBut recently, talent retention numbers have trended in the wrong direction, with ever more students leaving the U.S. after graduation; the number-one cause reported by these researchers is difficulty in receiving long-term residency and work authorization.[65]\n\nThis situation is anathema to the goal of maintaining a leading AI industry. It is not enough to simply build the biggest data centers (though that, too, is necessary; more on that below); rather, America's lead comes from the best scientists developing the most advanced algorithms. Researcher talent is, and can continue to be, the single largest advantage of the United States.\n\nMany top AI researchers have approvals for aliens of extraordinary ability, or aliens of exceptional ability plus national interest waiver green card petitions. In granting these approvals, the government certifies that they are top AI specialists. Yet due to statutory immigration limits based on country of birth, many researchers are stuck waiting for many years in the first case (extraordinary ability), or up to many decades in the second case (exceptional ability plus national interest waiver).\n\nThe main reason for these unreasonable waits for green cards is the numerical limits on employment-based (EB) immigrant visas: slightly more than 80,000 for the EB-1 and EB-2 categories each year (approximately 40,000 each). This limit includes the spouses and minor children of the principal applicants and is subject to a further limit per country of birth, such that no group of immigrants from a specific nation may receive over 7% of this limit, which ends up leading to lifetime waits for the most populous nations of India and, to a lesser degree, China. Still, demand for EB-2 visas is so large that immigrants from the rest of the world also face more than a year of waiting for these visas, despite not being subject to the per-country caps. In 2023, due to country caps, an Indian national with an advanced degree petitioning for a green card would have to wait a projected 150 years.[66]\n\nThe executive branch has some latitude to improve processing times and clarify pathways; but fundamentally, Congress must act. A bipartisan AI talent package should include:\n\nCombined, these small but critical changes would represent a change in the U.S. approach to AI talent immigration. Exceptional and extraordinary AI talent would be able to receive a green card in less than six months. At the same time, potential immigrants would be subject to rigorous security screening for aliens from adversary countries before they were allowed to work in sensitive industries.\n\nTraining AIs requires large data centers that use a massive amount of computing power and energy. To retain security and guard against foreign espionage, advanced AI models should be trained in data centers in the U.S., which will not be possible without a substantial growth in power output.\n\nOn current trends, power used in training single, state-of-the-art LLMs is increasing by one order of magnitude every two years. In 2022, an estimated 10 MW of constant power was needed. In 2024, an estimated 100 MW was needed, which is approximately equivalent to the energy needed for 10,000 and 100,000 homes, respectively.\n\nWe can extrapolate energy demands based on these trends. In 2026, 1 GW will be needed, approximately the power generated by the Hoover Dam or a nuclear power plant. In 2028, 10 GW will be needed, the power requirement of a small state. In 2030, 100 GW will be needed, 25% of current U.S. energy production.[69]\n\nOnce again, these demand estimates are not purely theoretical; leading companies are making investments to prepare for them. As mentioned, Amazon recently acquired[70] a nuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania capable of generating approximately 1 GW, enough for the anticipated 2026 scale models. Other labs are exploring building data centers in the Middle East for access to inexpensive energy.[71]\n\nEven if AI energy demands fall short of current trends, demands will be substantial, and labs and cloud-computing providers will be attracted to areas with low industrial electricity prices. The\n\nU.S. must deregulate its energy sector to allow supply to meet this rapidly increasing demand. Not only will inexpensive energy help domestic AI development, but it will boost manufacturing capability in other sectors as well. All energy sources should be employed, from solar and wind to nuclear and natural gas.[72]\n\nIn particular, the rapid scaling of AI will require energy sources that can be deployed quickly.\n\nShale reserves, such as the Marcellus Shale Formation in Pennsylvania, will be able to scale quickly to meet this demand if we let them. Between 2009 and 2019, U.S. petroleum production grew at a compound annual rate of 7.9%.[73] If petroleum production is allowed to continue, alongside the growth of wind and solar, it will be able to meet electricity demands. Hydraulic fracking must remain legal, and, where possible, projects should be fast-tracked and exempt from onerous environmental reviews.\n\nThe CHIPS Act of 2022[74] sought to bring advanced-logic chip production, which is largely based in Taiwan, to the United States. Yet the creation of domestic semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs) has been hampered by several needless obstacles. Because the fabs are funded by federal dollars, they trigger National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews. The goal of the infrastructure investments in the CHIPS Act was to quickly onshore chip production, but passing NEPA review might delay building for at least two years -- and likely longer.[75] CHIPS Act projects have been further inhibited by various diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requirements written into the law.[76] The legislative efforts to ease these restrictions have had bipartisan support; but so far, they have been unsuccessful.\n\nCHIPS Act projects must be exempt from environmental review requirements, and counterproductive provisions should be removed from the law. The removed provisions should include:\n\nIn addition, existing funding should be targeted toward advanced AI chips. CHIPS Act grants should be specifically awarded to companies aiming to produce state-of-the-art AI chips using technologies like advanced nodes and CoWoS architecture.\n\nOn October 27, 2022, the Bureau of Industry and Security issued regulations[80] concerning the export of advanced chips to China, in order to dramatically slow the growth of the Chinese AI industry. These regulations were updated and strengthened on October 17, 2023.\n\nThese regulations have successfully prevented advanced AI chips[81] from being exported to China, but BIS powers do not extend to key dimensions of the AI supply chain. In particular, whether BIS has power over the free distribution of models via open source and the use of cloud computing to train models is not currently clear.\n\nBecause the export of computing power via the cloud is not controlled by BIS, foreign companies are able to train models on U.S. servers. For example, the Chinese company iFlytek has trained models on chips owned by third parties in the United States.[82] Advanced models developed in the U.S. could also be sold (or given away, via open source) to foreign companies and governments.\n\nTo fulfill its mission of advancing U.S. national security through export controls, BIS must have power over these exports.[83] That is not to say that BIS should immediately exercise these powers -- it may be easier to monitor foreign AI progress if models are trained on U.S. cloud-computing providers, for example -- but the powers are nonetheless essential.\n\nWhen and how these new powers are exercised should depend on trends in AI development. In the short term, dependency on U.S. computing infrastructure is an advantage. It suggests that other countries do not have the advanced chips and cloud infrastructure necessary to enable advanced AI research. If near-term models are not considered dangerous, foreign companies should be allowed to train models on U.S. servers. However, the situation will change if models are evaluated to have, or could be easily modified to have, powerful weapons capabilities. In that case, BIS should ban agents from countries of concern from training of such AIs on U.S. servers and prohibit their export.[84]\n\nForeign adversaries and non-state actors may employ advanced AI systems against the United States. Controlling the proliferation of advanced AI systems will become a key policy issue. According to polling[85] from AI Policy Institute, \"Reducing the spread of dangerous AI\" is voters' top concern in AI policy. In particular, we should worry about scenarios where AI systems can disproportionately increase the strength of hostile state and non-state actors relative to the U.S. and allied militaries and law enforcement.\n\nWhile ensuring that domestic AI progress is paramount, scaling and widely deploying AI systems could create unpredictable threats. As with other sensitive technologies including aviation, nuclear energy companies, and disease research, policymakers need to encourage an internal culture of responsibility and preparedness. Reckless AI development could risk creating and proliferating highly advanced AI systems of which there is little understanding.\n\nTo combat these risks, the U.S. government and its partners must evaluate large AI models and understand the frontier of the industry. They must also understand where large AIs are being developed internationally and which powerful AIs are available to the public. In doing so, the U.S. can prepare for AI-related risk scenarios.\n\nWhen a new LLM is created, the capabilities are not immediately known and cannot be reliably predicted. For example, OpenAI's GPT-4 turned out to be a much better chess player than originally anticipated. These surprise capabilities are concerning in issues of national security, where an LLM with the ability to assist in the creation of a weapon of mass destruction could be unknowingly deployed. Initial studies suggest that current LLMs do not provide a strategic advantage above web search, but the edge of AI's systems will improve as they grow more capable.[86]\n\nTo avoid surprises, the U.S. must be aware of the capabilities of frontier models -- and, in certain highly sensitive situations, must build the capacity to evaluate the models themselves. NIST's AI Safety Institute should set standards for evaluations and should cultivate an ecosystem of evaluation to ensure their rigor and ensure that highly sensitive evaluations involve government input and coordination.\n\nBeyond evaluations of the models themselves, evaluators should understand how those models are susceptible to change when they are open-sourced, or via advanced prompting. Previous research has demonstrated that safeguards limiting the capabilities of open-sourced models can be cheaply removed, allowing users to access societally harmful information.\n\nSubsequent generations of frontier AI models will be increasingly likely to pose novel risks, including the proliferation of CBRN and other key military capabilities. Therefore, the largest models should be scrutinized.\n\nThe EU AI Act[87] and the American executive order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,[88] both from 2023, introduce compute thresholds, 10^25 FLOPS (floating-point operations, a measure of computer performance in computer science) in the EU, and 10^26 operations in the United States. Above these limits in the EU, AI systems fall under the \"systemic risk\" classification, the highest in their scheme. In the U.S., the executive order instructs the secretary of commerce to establish reporting requirements around these models. Models are also subject to oversight in both the EU and the U.S. if they are specially designed for use in certain areas, such as defense applications.\n\nThis approach -- of subjecting the largest, and only the largest, models to additional evaluations -- is the correct one. The 10^26 operation threshold should be retained. Beyond this threshold, models should be subject to evaluations by labs and the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (USAISI).\n\nNIST's USAISI should develop evaluation criteria to capture key model risks. These risk criteria should include the ability of the model to greatly empower the ability of hostile actors to do harm; the ability of the model to \"survive and spread\" autonomously; the ability of the model to employ superhuman persuasion; the ability of the model to facilitate the creation of weapons of mass destruction and CBRN; and the ability to significantly assist in military operations. If evaluations demonstrate a new model to be a significant military asset, the export of the model should be controlled, consistent with relevant BIS export controls, as other military technologies are.\n\nSimultaneously, AI researchers must still be able to experiment and develop the technology. Therefore, the compute threshold must be subject to regular review to ensure that it is capturing only models that potentially pose risks. If, for example, a generation of models in the order of 10^27 operations are evaluated to pose too little risk, the compute threshold under scrutiny should rise and further models of that size should not be subject to mandatory evaluations. If models of a certain size are evaluated to pose major risks, further planning must be done on how these models can be safely deployed.\n\nAIs may be used to instruct actors in developing traditional weapons of mass destruction, like nuclear and biological weapons. Nevertheless, access to these weapons will depend on actors' abilities to provision the physical goods required to build these weapons.\n\nFor example, future models may have the ability to assist in the development of bioweapons. Yet the actual creation of a bioweapon would necessitate access to further DNA synthesis tools. Currently, several startups offer DNA synthesis; put simply, they will create a strand of DNA to a customer's specification. If advanced AIs can generate DNA-based bioweapons, these vendors would make it very easy to obtain them.\n\nThese startups are not currently subject to regulation, such as mandatory screening for bioweapons or \"know your customer\" (KYC) rules. To defend against easier access to the knowledge of bioweapon development, government-funded research and government-procurement standards should require DNA synthesis companies to adhere to these policies.\n\nSimilarly, international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), as well as U.S. organizations such as the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), should analyze their processes in light of the possibility that the knowledge required to create nuclear weapons is likely to proliferate via AI systems, unless mitigations are put into place.\n\nSmall incidents occur with relative frequency in AI. A Cruise self-driving taxi fled from the police after it was pulled over.[89] Air Canada's AI-powered customer service bot gave a customer a refund that the airline didn't intend to offer.[90] Microsoft's Bing, while it was shortly deployed as an AI assistant, professed its love for some users and threatened others.[91]\n\nThese examples are largely frivolous, yet they elucidate the strange behaviors found in AI systems. The public, policymakers, and researchers need to know when these incidents occur. Incident reporting for AI would find an analog in cybersecurity, where, per the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022, reporting is mandatory for owners and operators of critical infrastructure within 72 hours. These reports are submitted to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\n\nWhat, exactly, constitutes an incident in AI requires further definition. Generally, AI incidents should be defined as the possibility or actuality of an AI doing major harm, AIs acting autonomously in unintended ways, or AIs deceiving users. Frontier AIs and those deployed in sensitive areas like military and law enforcement, intelligence, and critical infrastructure should be subject to more stringent reporting requirements. CISA, in conjunction with USAISI, should be tasked with developing these standards.\n\nFor the U.S. to take advantage of AI developments, it must understand them. Indeed, if the U.S. leads AI development but is not able to successfully integrate AI systems into our government systems, national security, and public sector, we risk not only forgoing many of the major gains from AI but could also be threatened by foreign rivals that are able to utilize AI tools more quickly.\n\nSeveral proposals in this report, including evaluations, incident reporting, and standardized responsible scaling policies, require the development of standards. While NIST is tasked with developing these standards, ambitious investments in NIST are essential to ensure that these standards can be developed quickly, rigorously, and effectively.\n\nIn 2024, NIST received approximately $35 million in funding, $5 million less than it requested. President Biden's 2025 budget calls for a $65 million budget for the Department of Commerce to invest in AI-related programs, including USAISI.[92] In contrast, the U.K. AI Safety has a budget of approximately \u00a3100 million per year.[93]\n\nThe standards that NIST and USAISI develop will allow the government to evaluate and understand AI systems, not to mention implement other key policies such as controlling the export of dual-use models and implementing cybersecurity standards. These efforts are foundational to any serious AI policy and deserve massive investment. This investment will be required to draw top technical expertise and conduct computationally intensive model testing.\n\nMuch larger investments in the Commerce Department must be made to meet these goals, commensurate with the U.K. AI Safety budget.\n\nThe U.S. government cannot utilize AI if it cannot recruit AI experts into its ranks. To do so, policymakers should create stronger hiring pipelines to bring AI specialists into government. These specialists will be necessary to enact many policies discussed in this report. They could deploy AI systems in government functions for more efficient administration, monitor frontier AI development, and implement and update AI-related policies that require a technical understanding.\n\nThe most pressing change needed is to adjust pay scales for technical talent. On February 27, 2024, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) permitted AI experts to be hired at General Schedule grades 9 through 15, approximately $51,000 through $160,000. While that is a step in the right direction, it is clearly insufficient to attract top talent to government roles. Recruiting website Glassdoor estimates that the average AI engineer makes $200,000 in the private sector. While it will be infeasible to attempt to match private-sector salaries, this report suggests that OPM must create a special rate for AI talent at least 30% above GS rates.\n\nOPM should explore additional policies, including fellowships, temporary appointments, expanded contracting, public-private partnerships, and partnerships with AI talent centers in allied governments in order to build stronger talent pipelines.\n\nCurrently, capital flows into the AI industry at an unprecedented rate; thus, most basic research in AI does not require government support. However, government investment in AI research might be well-placed to accelerate progress in specific neglected domains that create public goods across the industry. These investments would accelerate industry progress and lead to further public benefit.\n\nInvestment from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and defense funders such as DARPA and IARPA should increase support for these research projects, including:\n\nAs well as funding specific research agendas, the National Science Foundation should expand its programs to support AI research.[95] Because frontier AI research is so computationally expensive, incisive research is largely out of reach for computer scientists working in academia. With a public cluster, academic researchers could have access to an inexpensive and secure source of computing. So far, projects along these lines have been far too small: President Biden's budget suggests investing $30 million in the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot, a public-private partnership that gives researchers access to AI tools and resources.[96] But OpenAI has confirmed that the cost of training GPT-4 is estimated to be over $100 million.[97] At least $100 million should be invested into NAIRR; and if the pilot is successful, it should grow to a $1 billion program within two years.\n\nThe three leading AI labs -- OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind -- have released scaling policies, a public commitment of how they plan to pursue their AI research if issues arise in the creation of new, frontier models.[98] These policies inform the government as well as the public of how each lab will react in the case of an AI incident. By strengthening and standardizing these policies, the U.S. government -- particularly the defense and intelligence communities -- can better plan their responses to AI-related scenarios.\n\nCritics point out that current responsible scaling policies fail to address core elements of standard risk frameworks, including clearly defining risk tolerance, identifying and assessing risks, treating risks, and monitoring and reporting those risks.[99] USAISI should create clear standards to demonstrate how responsible scaling policies can meet the standards of well-structured risk-management policies. With NIST's framework, responsible scaling policies should be standardized across the industry.\n\nThe applications of AI to federal government processes are too numerous to list here. In any case, the development of modern AI systems has already created amazing opportunities to improve government functions and lower costs. Departments across the government should plan to procure AI systems and partner with AI companies to integrate these systems into government processes and accommodate new AI systems outside government. A few examples:\n\nThis report focuses on supporting innovation in AI and curbing the proliferation of AI systems with weapons applications. Regulations that are more expansive could stifle worthwhile AI progress and inhibit the growth of the industry. Nevertheless, there may be instances in which acute issues detrimental to the human person and caused by AI are worthy of government analysis and action.\n\nPerhaps the chief popular concern with AI is the possibility of mass unemployment and major changes to the labor market. Whether that will happen is significantly uncertain and has been the subject of major economic debate. AI could function like all other technologies. For example, AI might be akin to the computer, mostly complementing human labor but substituting against some jobs, such as low-level secretarial work and travel planning. Or it could have unprecedented effects, replacing human labor in much of the economy. Where, exactly, unemployment effects will occur is also highly uncertain: few would have guessed that illustration or voice acting would be among the first jobs to be automated by modern AI.\n\nConsidered together, the situation is too uncertain for government action, though AI-related job losses should be closely monitored. The White House should commission yearly reports from the Council of Economic Advisers to assess the current impacts of AI on jobs markets and forecast future impacts.\n\nFollowing the spread of recent deepfake, pornographic images, red and blue states alike have considered banning the creation of such material. The federal government should consider similar bans. These images have little value and could do serious psychological and reputational damage to their subjects. Furthermore, these laws are consistent with previous state-level prohibitions on \"revenge porn.\"\n\nCurrently, deepfake tools and other AI programs can be used to make highly deceptive political materials, including by imitating the voices of public officials and by creating videos of public officials using their voices. These tools are often used for innocuous content, such as humorous conversations between unlikely figures.\n\nYet these tools could be used to create highly deceptive political advertisements and campaign materials, which would mislead voters and erode trust in the democratic process. Banning the use of AI tools in political materials would be overly broad, as much of the video-creating and editing process might soon be performed with AI.\n\nBut candidates and political action committees should be required to disclose their use of AI, and the Federal Elections Committee should be tasked with reprimanding those in violation.\n\nAI is becoming more powerful. To obtain the opportunities offered by AI and navigate the policy landscape described in this report, the U.S. must lead the world in AI development, understand the capabilities of AI systems, and prevent any actions that would seriously undermine the national security of the United States.\n\nMaintaining and building upon their lead in AI progress will be a great accomplishment for American science and industry, and key deregulatory changes -- like deregulating energy production and data-center construction, unlocking AI talent, and fixing the CHIPS Act -- must be taken to ensure that this happens.\n\nThe U.S. must also be positioned to understand AI's increasing dual-use potential and, eventually, its key military applications. That is why the U.S. must build state capacity for AI, so that it can anticipate any serious national security hazards while imposing minimal, unnecessary burdens on the industry. This reasoning is a throughline of many policies, including investing in NIST and USAISI, evaluating frontier models, overseeing the training of frontier models, recruiting AI talent into government, and standardizing and strengthening scaling policies. With this state capacity, the U.S. will be well positioned to act quickly if and when AI systems become key military weapons. In that case, the U.S. must control the proliferation of those AIs, just as it does with virtually every other military technology to various degrees. At the same time, if for unforeseen reasons AI systems do not advance as quickly as predicted, these efforts will do little to unnecessarily hamper the industry.\n\nBeyond this approach of constant vigilance and awareness, policymakers' other regulatory actions should be minimal, so as not to encumber the industry. Defending high-risk supply chains, for example, will not encumber the AI industry at all and will make the U.S. better guarded against a range of potential terrorist threats. Other actions, such as the banning of nonconsensual, deepfake pornography and disclosures in political advertising, seek only to address acute issues.\n\nThe AI industry is facing the continuous risk of regulatory action that would stifle the industry because of misguided policymakers' muddled or undesirable policy goals. Many jurisdictions are currently entertaining comprehensive frameworks, regulations applicable to narrow AI applications, environmentalist-motivated anti-AI policies, or ideological mandates for AI. These approaches must be resisted. With decisive, early action at the federal level that is narrowly tailored to key areas, there will be little need for these ill-advised measures.\n\nNick Whitaker is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, where he analyzes emerging technology policy with a focus on artificial intelligence.\n\nHe is an editor and founder of Works in Progress, a magazine of new and underrated ideas in science, technology, and economics.

The coalition, supported by over 30 key tech stakeholders, aims to foster innovation among Indian AI startups while ensuring that the voices of industry, academia, and startups are heard by the government.\n\nHosted within The Dialogue tech think tank in New Delhi, CoRE-AI brings together prominent players from Big Tech, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), IT giants like Infosys, esteemed academic institutions like Ashoka University and IIM Bangalore, and leading AI startups including BharatGPT creator CoRover.ai and AI music startup Beatoven.ai.\n\nThe coalition's primary goal is to build public trust in AI through voluntary industry guidelines, robust regulatory frameworks, and public-private partnerships, addressing bias and fairness in AI algorithms, enhancing transparency in AI operations, and upholding user privacy and data protection.\n\nMr. S. Krishnan, Secretary of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), stated, \"The government welcomes support and interventions from a wide range of players who can provide relevant information. With these inputs, a robust framework will emerge, enabling India not only to benefit from AI but also to play a global leadership role. I am confident that CoRE-AI will contribute to this larger national goal,\" he added in a video statement.\n\nWith the vision of making AI work for India, the central government's Cabinet approved the IndiaAI mission in March, allocating a budget of \u20b910,372 crore.\n\nCoRE-AI, in its statement to The Hindu, emphasized a \"principles-based approach\" utilizing risk assessments to address AI's diverse challenges. It aims to develop guidelines and contribute to a robust governance framework to cultivate a trustworthy and innovative AI ecosystem in India.\n\nThe coalition plans to distinguish between regulating AI and promoting responsible AI practices, focusing on establishing overarching principles for ethical AI development and deployment. This approach aims to move beyond merely imposing restrictions on AI technologies, promoting an environment where ethical considerations, fairness, and transparency are integral to AI development.\n\nAdditionally, CoRE-AI will explore the impact of market forces on AI adoption, providing clear guidance on demand and governance frameworks to boost confidence and innovation among startups, a key focus of the coalition.\n\n\"For AI to be responsibly developed for the collective good, there must be explicit collaboration between startups, capital, policymakers, big tech, academia, and users. Frequent conversations and combined actions are essential to ensure that we innovate with the scale and transparency that AI requires,\" said Suparna Singh, CEO and Co-Founder of Frammer AI former President and CEO of NDTV, and a Member of CoRE-AI's Executive Committee.\n\nCoRE-AI's initiatives will be driven by four key Working Groups: Human-centred AI, focusing on prioritizing human rights and societal values; AI and Innovation, promoting and showcasing AI innovation in India; AI Governance, developing frameworks for ethical AI governance; and DPI and AI, exploring AI in government welfare delivery, digital inclusion, and public-private partnerships.\n\nLast year, IBM, Meta, several prominent universities like IIT Bombay, tech startups, and foundations formed a global \"AI Alliance,\" providing another avenue for responsible AI and potential competition for CoRE-AI. The AI Alliance aims to challenge the dominance of major players like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in AI, advocating for open innovation.\n\nAdditionally, the Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Consortium (AIKC), launched in March by 12 research institutions and think tanks, is dedicated to promoting a multi-stakeholder approach to AI governance in India.", "source": {"uri":

It is due to come into force on 1 August 2024 and will become applicable in a phased manner from between six and 36 months thereafter, with most provisions applying after 24 months.\n\nAs the world's most comprehensive legislative framework for AI developers, deployers and importers. the new Regulation seeks to guarantee that AI systems placed on the European Union internal market are secure, uphold current laws regarding fundamental rights and adhere to EU values.\n\nKey Obligations\n\nTaking the form of a Regulation, the AI Act is directly applicable on the EU's 27 Member States. The Act takes what the EU institutions have described as a \"risk-based approach\":\n\nTimeline and enforcement structure\n\nProvisions regarding prohibitions will apply already six months after the Regulation's entry into force on 1 August 2024, while requirements for GPAI will apply 12 months after. Most of the other provisions in the AI Act will apply 24 months after it enters into force, while some specific requirements for high-risk AI systems will apply after 36 months.\n\nWith regard to enforcement, the European Commission has established an AI Office on 16 June 2024, which is now located within the Commission's Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT), under the leadership of Lucilla Sioli. The AI Office has exclusive authority over GPAI models and has responsibility for developing the EU's expertise and capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe European AI Office has been restructured into five units and two advisory roles. These are:\n\nExcellence in AI and Robotics Unit Regulation and Compliance Unit AI Safety Unit AI Innovation and Policy Coordination Unit AI for Societal Good Unit Lead Scientific Advisor Advisor for International Affairs\n\nOverall, the AI Office is expected to employ over 140 staffers, including economists, technology specialists, administrative assistants, lawyers and policy specialists.\n\nIn addition to the AI Office, Member States will be required to appoint national competent authorities who will have responsibility for supervising the application and implementation regarding conformity to high-risk and prohibitions. An AI Board, comprising representatives from these Member States, will be established with the aim of providing a coherent implementation of Regulation. An Advisory Forum of stakeholders and a Scientific Panel of independent experts will also be established.\n\nPotential penalties\n\nPenalties for infringements of the new Regulation can reach up to EUR 35 million or 7% of annual global turnover, and up to EUR 15 million or 3% depending on the violation. Incorrect reports can result in penalties of up to EUR 7.5 million or 1.5% of annual turnover. Additionally, providers can be forced to withdraw non-compliant AI systems from the market.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe European Commission is planning to come forward with around 20 follow up documents by August 2026 including secondary legislation (Delegated Acts and Implementing Acts), guidelines and templates, in addition to codes of conduct, to support implementation of the AI Act. This is in addition to work on codes of practice to demonstrate compliance for general-purpose AI models until harmonised standards are established. Subsequently, the Commission may grant these codes EU-wide validity through an Implementing Act. Looking ahead, the new European Parliament is also expected to focus on the relationship between AI and copyright and on the use of AI in the workplace.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_single_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European single market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial Intelligence Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institutions of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate-General_for_Communications_Networks,_Content_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

While only 17% of AI decision makers around the world have fully implemented their initial AI plans, more than 9 in 10 say they are uncovering unexpected new use cases whether they are in the prototyping, launch, or scaling stages of AI implementation.\n\nThe research also finds AI leaders are \"sold\" on AI for industrial applications. The enthusiasm for a deeper commitment to AI investment is nearly universal, with 94% of those surveyed saying they have plans to expand their utilization of AI.\n\n\"There is no question that AI is currently at a pivotal moment,\" said Kevin Dehoff, Honeywell's Chief Strategy Officer. \"With the advent of Gen AI and more sources of data from advanced analytics, Industrial AI is poised to grow exponentially, and the possibilities are endless for revenue growth and employee satisfaction.\"\n\nAI Unlocks Workplace Benefits\n\nWhen asked for their thoughts on the impact of AI on industrials, nearly two-thirds (64%) of AI leaders cited efficiency and productivity gains among the most promising benefits. Sixty percent say improved cybersecurity and threat detection result from AI and 59% report better decision making due to real-time data generation.\n\nSeveral other benefits of AI for workers were also cited by respondents, including:\n\nSkills development is crucial in today's economy with baby boomers retiring and fewer replacements entering the workforce. Through AI, employers can more quickly upskill and reskill workers. AI will transform industrials as it enables workers to perform jobs at higher levels, providing greater job satisfaction while increasing productivity and addressing the skills shortage.\n\nLucian Boldea, President and CEO of Honeywell Industrial Automation, offered one direct example: \"There can be tens of thousands of instruments, equipment, and valves needed to process and manufacture a product and many of the parts we supply manufacturers require highly experienced technicians for operation and maintenance - and there are fewer and fewer of those experienced technicians available. With AI training and AI as a \"co-pilot\" the skills of a less experienced technicians can more quickly be upgraded, turning them into more elite experts that perform tasks based on enterprise knowledge and best practices. In turn, plants' operations can run more safely and reliably by dramatically reducing human error.\"\n\nWhat's Next for AI\n\nWhile the enthusiasm for AI to expand is palpable, there are still some challenges in the way of full adoption. More than a third of survey respondents (37%) feel that their C-Suite fully doesn't understand how AI works and almost half (48%) say they are having to continually justify or request resources needed to implement AI plans.\n\n\"Businesses of all types recognize that AI is transforming our world and creating new possibilities. For building operations - such as hospitals, campuses, and offices - it is clearly the future. As AI orchestrates controls that regulate HVAC, lighting and electricity usage, it helps to improve safety, operational and sustainability outcomes,\" said Billal Hammoud, President and CEO of Honeywell Building Automation.\n\nAll of this suggests the pace of change will be driven by compelling use cases that can be measured in terms of improved business performance. As new solutions demonstrate clear benefits to workforce productivity, safety, and reliability, AI adoption will dramatically increase with the potential to transform industrial operations.\n\nTo learn more about the survey results and Honeywell's work in AI and automation, please visit www.honeywell.com/us/en/ai/research.\n\nMethodology\n\nHoneywell commissioned Wakefield Research to survey AI leaders around the world. The online survey, which was conducted from April 22 through May 2, 2024, involved 1,600 executives in 12 global markets (US, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, United Kingdom, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates). Each respondent works at a company with at least 1,000 employees that is currently using AI to automate processes and tasks. All respondents are influencers or decision makers related to the use of AI within their departments or across their organizations.", "source": {"uri": "emsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A report by McKinsey Global Institute estimates that AI has the potential to generate up to $450 billion annually in value for the US healthcare economy by automating administrative tasks.\n\nAI and the future of personalized medicine\n\nThe holy grail of medicine is personalized care, where treatments are tailored to each individual's unique needs. AI is making significant strides in this direction. By analyzing a patient's medical history, genetic makeup, and lifestyle data, AI can predict their risk of developing certain diseases and recommend preventive measures. This proactive approach can lead to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs. For instance, a study by Mayo Clinic researchers showed that AI could effectively analyze a patient's medical records to identify those at high risk of developing opioid addiction, potentially reducing addiction rates and associated healthcare costs.\n\nDetailed analysis of ethical considerations\n\nHowever, the potential of AI in healthcare is not without its challenges. The implementation of AI in healthcare brings ethical considerations to the forefront. Data privacy is a critical concern, as AI systems require access to vast amounts of personal health information. Ensuring patient consent and maintaining confidentiality is paramount. Additionally, the development of fair and unbiased AI algorithms is crucial to prevent exacerbating existing health disparities. Transparency in AI decision-making processes, often referred to as the \"black box\" problem, must be addressed to build trust among healthcare providers and patients.\n\nChallenges and the path forward\n\nDespite its immense potential, AI in healthcare faces some challenges. One concern is the \"black box\" nature of some AI algorithms, where their decision-making processes are opaque. To ensure trust and transparency, it's crucial to develop AI models that are explainable to medical professionals. Additionally, the quality and quantity of data used to train AI models are paramount. Biased data can lead to biased algorithms, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities.\n\nPractical solutions for integration\n\nIntegrating AI into existing healthcare systems requires a multifaceted approach. Training healthcare professionals to work alongside AI tools is essential. Ensuring seamless interoperability between AI systems and electronic health records (EHRs) can facilitate efficient data exchange. Addressing financial barriers through strategic investments and collaborations can also support widespread adoption.\n\nThe future of healthcare powered by responsible AI\n\nThe future of healthcare is undoubtedly intertwined with AI. After years of searching for solutions, AI has arrived as a powerful tool to improve healthcare delivery. By harnessing the power of AI responsibly, we can achieve earlier diagnoses, more effective treatments, and ultimately, a healthier population. Responsible AI development practices that address bias, transparency, and privacy will be essential in unlocking the full potential of this transformative technology.\n\nHuman-AI synergy\n\nAI is not intended to replace healthcare professionals but to augment their capabilities. By handling routine tasks and providing data-driven insights, AI allows doctors and nurses to focus on patient care and complex decision-making. This synergy between human expertise and AI technology can lead to more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatments, and improved patient outcomes.\n\n(Author: Dr.Amit Kharat, Radiologist and Co Founder, DeepTek.ai)", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence in healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personalized medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mammography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lesion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayo Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112008420,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1040458,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

economic crises", "body": "The rapid growth in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are shaping economies worldwide, though significant uncertainties regarding the AI risk bringing with it global economic crises.\n\nThe current and developing AI technologies provide the potential to achieve security, efficiency, economic, and social goals of the digital economy today, however, experts warn of AI's privacy and ethical concerns, as well as other worries over privacy and misinformation.\n\nRecent researches showed that companies investing in AI-powered automation to boost profits lay off workers in times of crises to cut costs, leading to uncertainties of a wider threat of AI on the job market.\n\nSebnem Ozdemir, associate professor and head of the Data Science Department at Istanbul-based Istinye University, told Anadolu that the AI in question needs to be identified first and foremost to discuss the potential threats each type of AI technology poses.\n\nOzdemir stated that, in the case of data-based AI, which outputs responses based on collected data, these solutions induce issues regarding unfair competition and explainability.\n\nShe noted that the AI models that have already been in use for a long time have had serious use cases, for instance, in forecasting and directing the market with available data.\n\n\"A few months ago, there was a serious discussion in the UK regarding the crises these solutions may bring about and the ways we can combat them, the most important of which was the need for implementing regulations on the manipulation power of companies holding data monopolies, though data manipulation is only one of the issues,\" she said.\n\nOzdemir mentioned that black box AI systems fuel even further concerns, as they are impenetrable technologies whose inputs and actions are impossible to ascertain, in which algorithms make decisions without any clear or deductible reasons.\n\n\"For example, in the case of economy, a black box AI system can suggest an idea to direct the market, and let's imagine, the decision to be made turns out to be a big one, I mean, isn't that just scary,\" Ozdemir said.\n\nShe stated that in terms of generative AI technologies, which are categorized as generative pre-transformers (GPT) and large language models (LLMs), their decisions and suggestions may lead to even bigger crises.\n\n\"Although such AI tools are supposed to act like intelligent humans who have read all the books in the world, they still have human problems, such as making things up and believing them, whether or not their conceptualized ideas reflect real life or have real use cases in economy, for instance,\" she said, warning such solutions can lead to further economic crises.\n\n'Financial expert AI machines making financial decisions'\n\nOzdemir stated that although the use of AI has disadvantages, the advantages are aplenty, as companies can benefit from AI to boost their profit margins and attain market dominance while relying in part on AI for risk management.\n\nShe argued that the lack of resources leads to AI generating biased and incorrect responses, as its decision-making will be severely cut down, rendering it unsafe.\n\nShe added that the data training is extremely important in making AI models effective.\n\nShe noted that currently AI tools are too early in development to completely replace human workers, however, we are at a new point where the competence of people that train AI comes into the forefront.\n\n\"Imagine a digital entity making financial decisions with no salary expectations, of course companies will flock to such solutions,\" said Ozdemir.\n\nFinancial expert AI machines are created and developed very rapidly via human intervention in the process, Ozdemir mentioned.\n\n\"However, currently, it is too early to leave all the decisions to AI, and the current practice is to have human teams on the wheel steering AI to the right way, though this solution of constant human intervention in AI decision-making is estimated to last three years or so,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"},

This clearly underscores the growing demand for personalized workplaces, aiming to improve efficiency and satisfaction across all levels of employment.\n\nBy tailoring solutions to the unique needs of diverse worker personas -- frontline and back-office workers, modern leaders, knowledge workers or specialists -- AI is pioneering a workplace where technology adapts to us, making our work not only more productive but also more meaningful.\n\nContrary to concerns that AI might replace jobs, the reality is far more optimistic. There is excitement about the potential across all roles -- 74% of end-users believe that AI tools will increase productivity significantly. By understanding the needs of different work personas, we can break down use cases into tasks to identify which activities have the highest potential for automation.\n\nGenerative AI will transform workflows. Instead of writing meeting minutes and action item summaries, your AI companion can do it automatically. Instead of searching through your computer and the cloud to find a specific document or presentation, your personal companion can do that for you. We now have expertise at our fingertips, empowering us with new skills to create images or songs based on prompts describing the topic and style in half the time.\n\nIndependent software vendors (ISVs) will also become even more critical. Twenty-one percent of all new startups are AI/ML related, up 31% from a year ago. Large software companies for both horizontal and vertical markets also incorporate generative AI capabilities into their applications, effectively streamlining how we work. In many cases, we will have personal assistants fine-tuned to a specific task or job.\n\nAI is pivotal in enhancing connectivity in the modern workplace by offering solutions that promote genuine collaboration and engagement across teams. Hybrid work has benefited from AI in the past few years by improving connectivity with predicting and preempting hardware failures, streamlining communication and ensuring equitable collaboration regardless of where employees are located. AI in PCs can adjust lighting during a conference call so you can be seen best in any environment and cancel noise while at home when the dog barks or the lawnmower runs outside the window.\n\nWith generative AI and new AI PCs hitting the market, we're opening ourselves up to a world of new possibilities.\n\n* Eliminating unproductive work: To free up time and energy for more meaningful work, AI can automate repetitive, mundane and low-value tasks such as scheduling, meeting summaries and reporting. AI can also provide smart assistants and chatbots to answer queries, provide support and perform tasks on behalf of workers.\n\n* Enhancing efficiency in important work: Through augmented human capabilities and performance in critical and complex tasks, such as analysis, decision making and creativity. AI also offers personalized feedback, coaching and guidance to help workers improve their skills and achieve their goals.\n\n* Unlocking new superpowers: By enabling new ways of working that were not feasible before, such as real-time language translation and transcription, AI is breaking down communication barriers. With AI, anybody can create images, videos or songs without any artistic skills. AI can also be a hyper-personalized assistant by learning preferences to provide tailored content and execute tasks automatically. A world of new capabilities is within reach regardless of skill or expertise level.\n\nWe are only at the beginning of what is possible if the last year and a half is any indication. By automating tedious tasks, AI allows employees to focus on what truly matters, further accelerating productivity and enhancing job satisfaction. The ability of AI to synthesize information and provide instant insights is revolutionizing the way we work, making every moment count.\n\nAs we stand on the brink of a new era, it's clear that AI is not just a technological advancement; it's a paradigm shift towards a more personalized, efficient and enjoyable workplace. By understanding the unique needs of different worker personas and leveraging AI to address these needs, we can usher in a future where work is not just about what we do but how we do it -- effortlessly, creatively and with a sense of connection. AI is not just a tool. It's our partner in redefining the essence of work itself.\n\nForbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives.

It found that optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is a direct indicator of AI strategy maturity within their business.\n\nThe study found firms between $200-$500m the most optimistic about AI, while the UK and USA were the least optimistic countries. As the UK ranks eleventh, the research implies that the UK is further behind than anticipated.\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Country\n\nCountry\n\nOptimism Rank\n\nNorway\n\n1\n\nSweden\n\n2\n\nFrance\n\n3\n\nAustralia\n\n4\n\nJapan\n\n5\n\nUAE\n\n6\n\nCanada\n\n7\n\nDenmark\n\n8\n\nFinland\n\n9\n\nGermany\n\n10\n\nUK\n\n11\n\nUSA\n\n12\n\nThe IFS Global AI Optimism League Table by Company Size\n\nRevenue Band\n\nOptimism Rank\n\n$300 Million - $499.99 Million\n\n1\n\n$200 Million - $299.99 Million\n\n2\n\n$500 Million or over\n\n3\n\n$100 Million - $199.99 Million\n\n4\n\n$50 Million - $99.99 Million\n\n5\n\nCash isn't always king\n\nAn easy assumption to make with AI is that the more financial resources available, the more optimism there would be about what could be done with AI. However, the research reveals that businesses with revenues of over $500 Million ranked only third in terms of optimism due to a clear polarisation in strategy, data readiness, and skills. Indeed, the polarisation in AI readiness has led to 25% of this group believing AI benefits will materialise within 12 months, while the laggards don't expect to see benefits for at least three years. Large enterprises showed the widest gaps in time to benefits of any of the company size groups surveyed.\n\nIn contrast, the survey revealed mid-sized ($50-$200m) firms being less optimistic about AI purely because they have fewer resources and skills to deploy to the technology today, and therefore are planning over a longer period of time to drive benefits from a maturing technology.\n\nChristian Pedersen, Chief Product Officer, IFS, commented: \"At the surface level, the lack of optimism across some respondents may suggest we are at the edge of a trough of disillusionment, particularly following the all-encompassing hype that AI enjoyed for much of the last 18 months. What we are actually witnessing is enterprises differentiating themselves with AI. Organisations that have established a strong data foundation, invested in skills, and embedded sustainability into their strategy are optimistic because they can see the benefits coming into view quickly. It is vital that leaders see AI as a strategy, not a tool.\"\n\nFactors paving the way on the smooth path to AI\n\nDelving into what fuels optimism around AI, the research suggests that companies' architectural readiness directly correlates with their overall optimism about the technology. Respondents who report being more architecturally ready are more likely to be optimistic about AI. This indicates that companies with a strong cloud-based foundation are further along in their AI journeys and are most likely to believe that the tangible benefits of AI will become a reality sooner.\n\nPedersen continued: \"We see direct evidence from our research that the market is splitting into those who have embraced AI and those who have not. There is an element of 'following the herd' fueling the board's desire for AI programs. McKinsey has found that AI could be the key to unlocking an additional $4.4 trillion in corporate profits per year, which is building pressure to adopt it. Without a clear direction and strategy, AI programs stall, making the end result seem further away than it needs to be.\"\n\nEmergence of Industrial AI for productivity, innovation and sustainability\n\nInnovative products and services (31%) and data accessibility (30%) are the most common areas senior decision-makers expect AI to make large differences, followed closely by cost reductions (29%). Interestingly, at a country level, the USA (32%) and Germany (31%) were the only nations most likely to believe that AI will lead to consistent business growth.\n\nThe survey reveals a positive correlation between skills and AI optimism. The nations most likely to identify as having invested heavily in skills for several years are generally more optimistic about AI overall. France (49%), UAE (53%), Norway (48%), Australia (46%), Sweden (46%) and Japan (45%) are leading the way here.\n\nSustainability planning also correlates directly with overall AI optimism. The less wide-ranging a country's sustainability strategy was with regard to AI, the less likely they were to be optimistic about AI in general. UK (5%), Canadian (6%), Danish (6%) and Finnish (4%) respondents were least likely to have an AI strategy for sustainability in place and all feature in the bottom half of the optimism league table.\n\n\"The lofty expectations for AI bely a fundamental misunderstanding of how it is supposed to drive value. The real power lies in Industrial AI, where data flows through every part of your business, combining structured, interlinked datasets to uncover insights, optimise every process and marry the digital with the physical world. That's where the true value lies. If a business doesn't have a strategy to reach that point, then they need a partner who can guide them on that journey,\" concluded Pedersen.", "source": {"uri": "itrportal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IT Reseller Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_holden@itrportal.com", "name": "Ed Holden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.607843137254902, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

AI can evaluate large datasets for patterns better than humans can. It can flag potential equipment failures for repair before damage occurs and can drive automated decision-making to improve oil production. And generative AI, which uses massive datasets to deliver information and answer questions, opens up even more possibilities for the industry.\n\nOf course, implementing AI and generative AI solutions means companies will have to take into consideration the state of existing data and accept the fact that AI will change work in unexpected ways, experts said at recent events in Houston.\n\nBrad Davis, CEO of RIOT SCADA, said during the AI in Oil & Gas conference in April that it's helpful to think of ML as being similar to how humans learn to beat a video game level by incrementally improving as they replay the level. ML requires a huge amount of pristine data, he noted. It can be easy to taint that data, as in the example of Netflix profiles which run on ML.\n\n\"This is why my wife won't let me on her Netflix account, because I screw up her algorithm,\" he said.\n\nDeep learning, he said, handles large-scale pattern recognition and can be useful for things like detecting leaks and flare emissions.\n\nWhen generative AI is used to enhance SCADA data, or the data related to controlling, monitoring and analyzing industrial equipment and processes, it can improve employee performance across the board, according to a joint Stanford University and MIT study published in 2023.\n\nFor example, a person comfortable working with data may have a productivity level of 80% compared to 60% for one who struggles with data and does not care to use a data dashboard, Davis said.\n\nThe 2023 study revealed that generative AI boosted by 34% the productivity of employees uncomfortable with data-driven environments to 94% productivity, while generative AI upped the productivity of employees already comfortable working with data from 80% to 91%.\n\nThat improvement happens by \"taking data outside the realm of data and putting it in the realm of conversation,\" he said.\n\nIn short, generative AI makes it possible to interact with data in a completely different way, Catalina Herrera, field chief development officer at Dataiku, said during the same event.\n\n\"We talk to data, ask questions of the data,\" she said.\n\nGenerative AI can be used to increase general productivity and remove dull, menial tasks, Brent Railey, chief data and analytics officer at Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., said during the same event.\n\nHe urged companies to be strategic in how they adopt AI and generative AI technologies, not least because AI's success hinges on the quality of the data it uses.\n\n\"Generative AI will uncover your data governance problems,\" he said. \"Trying to fix your data quality problems is like boiling the ocean.\"\n\nGiven the importance of data quality, Alina Parast, senior vice president and CIO at ChampionX, said during the same event that no data is brought into the company's enterprise data lake until \"it's clean and validated.\"\n\nBen T. Wilson, director of products and solutions at Amazon Web Services (AWS), said during CERAWeek by S&P Global that AI loves complexity but the data it uses must be of high quality.\n\n\"AI is very much garbage in, garbage out. If you have high-quality data, in other words, accurate data, whether it's IoT (Internet of Things) type data or maintenance data, then you're going to get much better results from your AI,\" Wilson said.\n\nAlthough generative AI has massive potential, Wilson cautioned that the tech is still young.\n\n\"I don't think I see anything that's mature in generative AI yet. Generative AI is so new, it's been around for 18 months. We can't expect maturity in it,\" he said.\n\nDespite this fact, Bill Vass, AWS' vice president of engineering, who also spoke at CERAWeek, said he sees a future where generative AI is as ubiquitous and helpful as spell check.\n\nAnd in much of the same way that spell check has not put writers out of business, generative AI coding capabilities will not replace software engineers, he said. Amazon CodeWhisperer, for instance, handles the drudgery of writing software code, he said.\n\nAs a software engineer, Vass said, \"the hard part is figuring out what you want to do. And once you've figured it out, it's busy work to do the coding.\"\n\nGino Hernandez, head of digital for ABB Energy Industries, said during CERAWeek that the company is launching a generative AI bot for diagnosing asset failure and repair using natural language.\n\n\"You're able to ask the asset, 'When was the last time you failed? When it failed last time, what did you do?' And then most importantly, the operator can ask, 'Well, how do I fix this?'\" he said. \"And it's a game changer.\"\n\nGen AI is also expected to boost software engineering productivity by 50%, resulting in cleaner code with better documentation and more cybersecurity, he said.\n\n\"We have hundreds of R&D engineers developing our software. If I could unlock 50% more capacity of that organization, that is huge,\" he said.\n\nVivek Chidambaram, senior managing director at Accenture Strategy, urged business leaders to become familiar with AI, noting that while Canadian author Malcolm Gladwell popularized the idea that 10,000 hours of practice results in expertise, leaders need far less experience with AI to lead effectively.\n\n\"About 1% to 2% of that time is the minimum amount of time that you need to put in as a leader. Otherwise you're simply not in the game. The same sort of thing has to apply to the rest of the organization,\" he said during CERAWeek.\n\nChidambaram noted that throughout history, technology has destroyed some jobs and created others and suggested that AI will probably create jobs that at present \"we can't comprehend.\"\n\nChase Lochmiller, Crusoe Energy Systems co-founder and CEO, is optimistic about AI's effect.\n\n\"I definitely view it as more friend than foe. I think there's a lot of talk around AI taking people's jobs, but I'm sort of the opinion that AI can be a catalyst for the greatest job-creating event in the history of humanity,\" he said during CERAWeek. \"When we invented the tractor, it might have taken some farming jobs, but it freed up human capacity to go pursue other interests and higher leverage, more productive things for society.\"\n\nCapitalism will likely drive AI adoption.\n\n\"If you don't adopt fast enough, your competitors will,\" he said.\n\nAnd the change is definitely coming.\n\n\"We're sort of facing ... a Darwinian event for corporations in terms of the genie's not going back in the bottle. We've broken through this level of productivity gains that people are able to get from AI, and it's at a moment of rapid exponential increase in the development of this technology,\" Lochmiller said.", "source": {"uri": "hartenergy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hart Energy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type":

AI now empowers investors through near-instantaneous analysis of vast quantities of data, market predictions and even automation of portfolio management. As investors are deluged with information and rapidly changing markets, AI can provide clarity and the competitive advantage needed to succeed in financial markets.\n\nAI in investing refers to the application of algorithms and machine learning for financial purposes including analyzing data, recognizing patterns, and providing recommendations to make investing decisions. AI technologies can assist investors in acquiring insights, assessing risk, and gauging sentiment to make informed investments. These technologies can also be utilized to make trades based on pre-set conditions and manage portfolios using guidelines and rules set by an investor.\n\nWhile AI technology has a learning curve, even for seasoned investors, it offers the potential for enhanced strategies, quicker decision making, and ultimately better returns.\n\nInvestors can use AI to enhance their investment strategies through analysis of stocks, data, sentiment and potential risks to identify opportunities and threats to their portfolio. AI can also be used to proactively execute trades with algorithmic trading as well as through portfolio management to oversee diversification and allocation. This section will explain the 6 key ways to fully leverage AI in your investing strategy.\n\nAI stock screeners can be used to identify new investment opportunities based on criteria you set, the model used by the screener and applied datasets. Investors can use these stock screeners to find the best stocks to trade or identify patterns in various markets. These screeners can help investors to more quickly analyze and act on opportunities.\n\nAI can be used to assess and manage potential investment risk by analyzing data to identify or predict volatility, threats and opportunities. Real-time insights from AI based on political events, company news or economic factors can help you adjust your portfolio by quickly offloading positions at risk. AI-powered risk evaluation can help boost your portfolio returns efficiently and quickly all while reducing costs by automating analysis.\n\nRobo-advisors are investing platforms that automate portfolio management by rebalancing and harvesting tax losses. They are usually personalized based on the age, time horizon or goals of an investor. Algorithmic trading uses AI to trade based on conditions set by the user and data. These strategies can be complementary if an investor utilizes a robo-advisor for a more conservative strategy while utilizing algorithmic trading with a smaller percentage of their portfolio to make high-risk, high-reward trades.\n\nAI can assist with portfolio management to propose or execute changes to maintain asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing based on the potential for returns or to avoid risk. Portfolio management can be costly due to the need for human analysis but AI presents the opportunity to automate laborious tasks while matching or exceeding human efficacy.\n\nBy processing vast quantities of data, including market data, financial reports and news, AI can uncover insights that assist investor decision making. Through pattern recognition and trend analysis, AI helps investors to find new opportunities and make better investment decisions. By utilizing AI to conduct data analysis, investors can more quickly and efficiently take advantageous action.\n\nAI can be used to gauge investor sentiment towards specific stocks, for example small-cap value stocks or markets to help you identify opportunities or upcoming changes to your positions. AI accomplishes this by assessing tone and sentiment from data sources like social media or articles to help predict stock, sector, or market movements.\n\nBefore getting started with using AI to invest, you should explore different available AI tools and determine how they can fit your unique situation and needs. For example, seeking out an AI tool that can perform algorithmic trading on its own vs. a data analysis tool that would help you find stocks to trade. Another key component of your research should be on the accuracy and credibility of these tools. Learning more about the creators of the tool, their disclosures and data sources. Finally, it will be key to research the costs of AI tools to strike a balance between how much you'll spend with the value you'll receive.\n\nAs you get started with your new AI toolset, take it slow to make sure you understand the tool's capabilities and your comfort level with utilizing it. This is especially key to ensure you don't commit too much money to an unproven strategy. As you gain confidence in using AI in your investing process, monitor outcomes and determine whether you have the right tools you need for investing success.\n\nAs you incorporate AI into your investing strategy, gauge how effective recommendations or performance are against an industry benchmark. For example, if you're using a robo-advisor, compare performance against the market as a whole. If you're trading on AI insights, pay attention to news and stock screeners to be aware of new information which could affect your trading strategy.\n\nWhen using AI to invest, there are a few key strategies you should employ to maximize the benefits of this technology and the returns for your portfolio.\n\nAI is a fast moving space with tools being updated and replaced seemingly on a monthly basis. Utilizing tools you've discovered to their full extent as well researching new tools to utilize will increase your AI investing odds. Your investing results will only be as good as your tools and the underlying data they use and the insights they provide.\n\nBe ready to change your investing strategies based on new insights provided by your AI tools but be aware of the limitations of these tools such as knowledge gaps or biases. AI is excellent at quick pattern and trend recognition with the right data sets so trust, but verify. With the right model and evaluated data, AI can identify upcoming market or stock moves which could require quick strategy changes.\n\nAI can provide excellent analysis but human insight and oversight is essential to make the right investment decisions. Utilizing the human insight of experts on topics like this AI investing outlook as well as your own insight is key. By combining your unique experience and judgment with AI data analysis and evaluation, you can make informed decisions and maximize investment outcomes. AI is not yet omniscient and shouldn't be treated as such.\n\nBy adding AI to your toolkit, you can improve the speed and efficacy of your investing strategies. As covered, these powerful new algorithms, models and tools can assist with your stock picking, risk management, and portfolio returns. While researching and choosing tools requires patience, evaluation, and prudence, they can pay off in the long run by combining your human intelligence with complementary machine intelligence for a hybrid tackling of complex financial markets.\n\nTechnology will continue to transform the investing world but with proactive adaptation, you can stay ahead of the curve, thrive, and leave your mark in the markets.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithmic trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo-advisor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robo-advisor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_allocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asset allocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pattern recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Value_Based_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Value Based Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a26809115f811da8d2554c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

That assistant lets users describe their meals using voice or text.\n\nIt also lets users take photos of their meals so the AI technology can recognize ingredients.\n\nWhile the beginning stages of Welli led to many hallucinations, the current version is configured with retrieval augmented generation, a now widely used technique that helps large language models find and use the most current and specific information.\n\nIn this Q&A, Noom CEO Geoff Cook discusses the advantages of AI technology in wellness as well as the need for collaboration between humans and AI.\n\nWhat has been the response to adding AI into your wellness products?\n\nGeoff Cook: It's been well received. One of the things that we wanted to make real clear is when you're chatting with an AI and when you're chatting with a human.\n\nThat was the thing we didn't want to have any confusion about, because we felt like that would be an area of concern if you're not sure.\n\nWhat was interesting about adding the AI into our coaching flow is that we were then able to free up some coaching time to bring those coaches into the premium service of our product and offer one-on-one, [direct messaging] chat -- basically a more intensive, dedicated coach for you on your weight loss journey.\n\nWe were able to leverage some of the efficiencies gained from launching Welli and taking that human time that freed up, reallocating those coaches to our premium users and giving them a dedicated coach.\n\nPeople still demand human interaction and expect human interaction and connection.\n\nHumans are quite good at helping folks with motivation. People feel accountable. They feel accountability to humans in a way they don't, at least today, to an AI.\n\nAI is extremely good at answering things like, \"I want to know, is this food orange or green? What's a good recipe right now?\"\n\nIt's impossible for an AI to have a fully encapsulated view of who the user is and all the data they've shared and, therefore, be able to make in-the-moment suggestions that may be more relevant.\n\nWe try to use the humans for the human bits and the AI for the always-on.\n\nHow has your used of AI augmented your human coaches?\n\nCook: The last thing we would ever want to do is replace our human coach with AI technology.\n\nPeople value their human coach, and no one thinks an AI and a human are equivalent in what value they provide.\n\nThey're different. You must be thoughtful with leveraging AI into an existing system. If you just go for efficiency, you may be removing a really valued part of the relationship between a coach and someone on a weight loss journey.\n\nYou've got to be careful about how you roll it out.\n\nThe way we think of it is, we want to give those coaches superpowers that they wouldn't otherwise have had.\n\nWe're able to give the coaches a quick synopsis right next to the chat box so they are quickly able to really understand what this member has been up to for the last two weeks. They don't have to spend five minutes, 10 minutes for each person trying to do that to respond to them.\n\nIt helps them get up to speed very quickly.\n\nThe future of medicine may well be to do something different or something like that -- not with coaches but with doctors.\n\nYou can imagine a system that is able provide the doctor with AI-enabled superpowers, where your every expression is detected, and where a condition might be suggested to the doctor that he might not have noticed because he lacks all the data collection powers and processing of that AI.\n\nLeveraging AI to parse all this data and then help a human make the right decision or the right suggestion at exactly the right moment -- that's what AI done right in a healthcare setting looks like.\n\nHow does Noom handle hallucinations from its AI system?\n\nCook: The way you must deal with hallucinations is to create different anti-hallucination models to try to minimize that as much as possible. You have to make sure that any humans consuming the AI is aware of those limitations.\n\nIt's also the case that with the big LLMs -- the large language models from makers like Google, Meta and OpenAI -- they're very much working on this problem too.\n\nHow is AI changing the health and wellness industry?\n\nCook: I was on a panel at a University of California, San Francisco conference a month or two ago. One of the themes from that conference was that there's just not enough doctors to provide the needed care.\n\nThere's a lot of other problems in the healthcare system. But even just from a demand and supply perspective, even if you could get everyone a doctor, there's just not enough of them.\n\nThe way population dynamics are working, you're going to have a lot more people retiring, which means a lot of doctors will be retiring.\n\nThe actual working workforce will be shrinking. But the number of people they need to support will be increasing, because retirees are living longer.\n\nTherefore, as bad as the doctor shortage might be right now, it will only get worse over the next 20 years.\n\nThe way out of that problem is probably not manufacturing more doctors. It takes a great amount of time to do that.\n\nAI could well be one of the more efficient care models and is almost certainly part of the solution.\n\nThat was where the excitement was around AI at that recent event. That is where we're excited too.", "source": {"uri": "techtarget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechTarget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interpersonal relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/health analytics_a298611193.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 336, "textEnd": 343}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

But as the technology rapidly changes, it is not clear how this would work or what it will mean for teachers and learners.\n\nScience Minister Judith Collins' vision is for every student to have their own AI tutor. As Collins explained in a recent interview, \"So instead of having to be wealthy enough to employ a tutor to help the children with the math or science questions, or something else that the parent doesn't know much about maybe, is to enable that child to have their own [AI] tutor.\"\n\nBut like AI itself, the concept of an AI tutor is still evolving. The idea of creating a \"teaching machine\" has been around for 100 years or so, and \"intelligent tutoring systems\" have been around since the 1980s with limited results.\n\nThe more recent advances of AI have rekindled the elusive promises of these systems. But while the technology has evolved, the basic concept of a machine taking over some of the responsibilities of the teacher has remained the same.\n\nAn AI tutor is a proxy for a human tutor -- supporting and \"scaffolding\" a student's learning. Scaffolding is the space between what a learner can do without assistance and what they can learn next with the support of someone who is more knowledgeable.\n\nIn theory, an AI Tutor can play this role. But there are inherent dangers. What if your more knowledgeable tutor is not, in fact, more knowledgeable, but just makes things up? Or shows bias? Or favors uncritical, shallow material over more reliable resources?\n\nThe features that give generative AI its capabilities to interact with users also create its flaws. AI relies on the data it is trained on. However, this data can be wrong, and AI neither validates what goes into it, nor what comes out.\n\nThis issue has raised concerns about fairness. As AI tools consume quantities of unfiltered data, the risk is they will reinforce existing biases in this data, perpetuating gender stereotypes and other negative outcomes.\n\nFor people from Indigenous cultures, including M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, AI provides both opportunities and threats.\n\nIf AI systems are trained on biased data or without considering diverse perspectives, there is a high likelihood decisions being made based on these systems will favor one group over others, reinforce stereotypes, and ignore or undervalue different ways of living and thinking.\n\nThe concern isn't just about the influence AI can have on us but also how AI consumes and processes data. AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, often without properly acknowledging the sources or respecting creators' copyrights.\n\nFor Indigenous peoples, this can infringe upon their data sovereignty rights and exploit their cultural and knowledge heritage. This exploitation can perpetuate inequality and undermine the rights and contributions of Indigenous communities.\n\nA commonly proposed answer to this problem is to train AI systems on carefully curated data.\n\nBook publisher Pearson, for example, has recently integrated AI in 50 of their textbooks. This allows students to use AI chatbots to engage with the texts.\n\nAccording to Pearson, these tools are developed using a \"walled garden\" approach. The AI is trained only on the contents of these books. This, Pearson claims, reduces the risks of inaccuracies.\n\nHowever, the walled garden approach also has major drawbacks, since it limits content to that selected and approved by the supplier. What does this mean for cultural knowledge and rights? Critical perspectives? Innovation in learning?\n\nPearson has, for example, been criticized for the content of some of its books. In 2017, the company apologized for a medical textbook considered \"racist.\"\n\nIf a New Zealand AI tutor were to be created from local data, how could we ensure tikanga M\u0101ori protocols are safeguarded? As highlighted by M\u0101ori scholar Te Hurinui Clarke, there are significant challenges around the respectful and ethical handling of M\u0101ori knowledge.\n\nWhen it comes to AI tutors, policy makers need to ask who would be the custodians of this data, whose knowledge would be used and who has the rights to access?\n\nIf done well, a walled garden approach might provide a comprehensive, inclusive, culturally sustaining pathway to better learning. However, given the challenges of such an undertaking (never mind the expense), the chances of success in practice are extremely small.\n\nMeanwhile, we can't just wait for AI tutors. AI is a reality in schools, and we need to prepare students for what they face now and in the future. Specific tools are important, but our focus should be on developing AI literacy across the educational sector.\n\nThis is why we are researching what it means to be AI literate and how this can empower critical evaluation and ethical use, ensuring AI complements rather than replaces human teaching.\n\nWe see the development of AI literacy, supported by suitable frameworks, as a priority, something all students, no matter their age, need to have.

Here's how it's impacting business and academia.", "body": "For decades, the field of artificial intelligence seemed stagnant. Researchers started gaining momentum in the early 2010s as deep learning proved useful in real-world applications such as speech recognition. The real inflection point, however, did not come until November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nThe chatbot represented a huge leap in AI's capabilities. The ability to build intelligent systems out of computer chips, a goal that seemed decades away, now seems within reach. ChatGPT's advanced natural language processing abilities showcased the potential for AI to comprehend and generate human-like text, proving to be a versatile tool for a plethora of applications from customer service to content creation.\n\nThis technology has drastically changed the field of AI, driving activity in both the private sector and academia. Major technology companies and startups are investing heavily in AI development, creating a competitive landscape in the field. Universities are also ramping up their AI research programs to keep pace with industry advancements. According to the 2024 Stanford AI Index Report, this frenzy is reshaping industries through a surge in startup formation and accelerated research efforts.\n\nVerbit analyzed Stanford's AI Index Report to better understand how AI has changed in recent years and highlighted the exponential growth in AI-related publications and patents.\n\nLet 1,800 flowers bloom\n\nThe Stanford report shows a nuanced picture of how the technology sector is changing in light of the AI boom. Overall global corporate investment in AI actually peaked in 2021 and has fallen the past two years, down to $235 billion in 2022 and $189 billion in 2023.\n\nIn part, this decline can be attributed to high interest rates. In 2022, central banks around the world started to combat inflation by raising interest rates. This in turn has made companies more hesitant to make as many large-scale investments as they otherwise would have.\n\nBut investors may have reason to be wary; many high-profile AI companies have struggled to stay afloat despite producing innovative technology. Take, for instance, Stability AI, the creators of a leading image-generation model. The company raised funds at a $1 billion valuation in 2022 but has struggled to turn a profit. According to reports by Reuters and The Information, the company recently installed a new CEO, raised $80 million, and settled about $400 million in debt.\n\nInflection AI, the startup behind the chatbot Pi, raised $1.3 billion in 2023 at a $4 billion valuation but has been unable to find a business model. In March 2024, Microsoft, which had previously invested in Inflection AI, all but acquired the company, according to Bloomberg. The Washington-based tech giant agreed to pay Inflection $650 million to license its technology and hire most of its employees.\n\nThough overall investments in AI declined, generative AI is an exception to this downturn. Investment in generative systems that create text and images soared to $25 billion in 2023, up from roughly $3 billion a year earlier. Business formation is also trending upward. About 1,800 new AI companies received funding in 2023, an increase of about 40% from 2022.\n\nThe U.S. has by far the hottest AI market, accounting for $67 billion of investment in 2023, compared with just $7.8 billion in China and $3.8 billion in the United Kingdom. U.S.-based institutions were behind 61 notable AI models in 2023, compared with China (15), France (8), and Germany (5), according to the Stanford report. America's dominance is not without precedent: The country has led in private AI investment since 2013 -- a gap that has only widened in recent years.\n\nAcademics are struggling to keep up\n\nThe generative AI boom has significantly impacted the academic research landscape. According to the latest data, academic journal articles in the field surged to over 240,000 in 2022, marking a dramatic 175% increase from 2010. Machine learning studies have seen particularly explosive growth, with publications soaring from around 6,000 in 2010 to over 70,000 in 2022, underscoring the rapid advancement and growing interest in the sector.\n\nThe surge of interest in AI has also changed where academic research is done. Up until the mid-2010s, most leading machine learning models came from academia. However, university researchers now lag behind their private-sector counterparts because they have only a fraction of the resources in comparison.\n\nTech companies can offer researchers much higher salaries -- and massive amounts of compute. GPT-4, the model behind ChatGPT, has been estimated to cost $78 million to train, while Google's Gemini Ultra has been estimated to cost $191 million. These numbers are high in the corporate world but would be considered astronomical in academia.\n\nAll of the commercial interest in AI has come with a cost. Historically, researchers have been keen to share their models and data with others. But industrial labs, which have invested billions in research and development, are much more cautious about collaboration. OpenAI, for instance, was founded as a nonprofit to share its work with the public out of fears that one leading tech company might monopolize the technology. It open-sourced GPT-2, an earlier chat model, but has since declined to share its models with the public, citing safety concerns.\n\nOther researchers have followed suit. In February of last year, Google's head of artificial intelligence announced his staff should hold off on publishing their work, marking a sharp reversal of their policy pre-ChatGPT. Google, whose researchers made many of the discoveries driving current generative AI models, has so far failed to capitalize on its work, despite a generous head start.\n\nFrancois Chollet, a computer scientist at Google, recently lamented on a podcast that \"frontier research was no longer being published,\" blaming OpenAI for creating the current competitive dynamics.\n\nThe AI sector is booming. But many tech leaders now worry that their companies might not come out on top.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wade_zhou@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Wade Zhou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI boom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fc8xv8/picture290436854/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/5c0829c3-5a1f-426f-92a9-863662211c92", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The July 12 event brought together experts from industry, academia, and government to discuss artificial intelligence, its challenges and potential actions that can help us navigate this landscape going forward, under the theme \"Actionable Insights: Seeding Our Way Forward in AI.\"\n\n\"It's a technology that's going to affect all fields and intersect every part of the economy, including science and how science is done\" said Dario Gil, senior vice president and director of research at IBM, in delivering the Forum's William D. Carey Lecture.\n\nRecent breakthroughs in AI have reverberated through all sectors, and their impact has reached the sciences. Machine learning tools offer novel ways to tackle computationally expensive problems that are exponentially faster than previously possible, while generative AI can speed up research and development pipelines. Speakers noted that humans and traditional computational methods are still needed, but these AI tools open new avenues for researchers.\n\nTo Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft, this is only the beginning.\n\n\"AI is in the early days of helping scientists with modeling and reasoning,\" Horvitz said in the opening Gilbert S. Omenn Grand Challenges Address, in which he discussed how AI has the potential to be a revolutionary transformation for the sciences and bring novel solutions to the grand challenges facing our world.\n\nAlready, the AI tools available to scientists and engineers are shaking the status quo. GitHub Copilot, a generative AI tool for programmers, has been shown to increase the efficiency of programmers by 50 percent and has been transformative for the software industry, he said. That same technology can be used to synthesize data, Horvitz explained. Analogous to consumer-facing AI assistants, modern AI models can be pointed at databases of research articles and do a literature review, weighting and comparing each relevant article and presenting those findings to a researcher within a matter of minutes.\n\nThe impact of AI has the potential to be even larger in areas of science that rely heavily on computation. In materials science, for instance, AI tools can act as an approximate simulator and churn through hundreds of thousands of potential materials at a rapid pace to determine their properties while traditional simulation methods would falter.\n\nThese tools extend beyond the well-known generative AI models and \"will take leveraging sets of AI innovations, not just the latest, shiniest tools,\" Horvitz said. \"It's a rich constellation of AI technologies.\"\n\nCiting a recent collaboration between Microsoft and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory that used multiple AI models and traditional computing methods to investigate new lithium-based batteries, Horvitz stated the AI tool used was thousands of times faster and much more cost-efficient than the traditional approach -- from 20 years at around $2 billion to 80 hours and roughly $350,000.\n\nSimilar AI tools are making breakthroughs elsewhere, including Science's 2021 Breakthrough of the Year awarded to a team from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of Washington that used AI tools to accurately and quickly determine the structure of any protein. A team at MIT used similar techniques to develop novel antibiotics that are effective against current antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nReflecting on the history of scientific excellence in the United States, Gil sees today as an inflection point where smart and coordinated efforts and investments are needed across industry, government and academia to keep on pace with other global powers. \"We have our work cut out for us,\" he said. However, he adds that legislation such as the CHIPS and Science Act are paving the way for a strong future of American science.\n\nWhile the many benefits of AI in the sciences are something to be excited about, speakers urged for consideration of its risks.\n\n\"All great innovations in technology are dual use,\" Horvitz said. \"The newfound powers and capabilities can always be used to achieve wonder, as they have for humanity, but they can also cause harm.\"\n\nTechniques used to develop drugs could also be used to develop novel chemical weapons, and the risks of AI extend beyond the sciences from issues surrounding accuracy of information to the potential for AI tools to allow disinformation campaigns to operate at previously unimaginable scales or speeds, speakers at breakout sessions at the Forum noted.\n\nA panel on harnessing AI's potential also touched upon handling the potential risks of a world where embedded AI -- in which intelligent platforms enable smart interactions integrated into our everyday lives -- is already ubiquitous.\n\n\"We want technology that's easy to do the right thing, difficult to do the wrong thing and easy to recover if something unintentionally goes wrong or even intentionally,\" said Elham Tabassi, chief AI advisor at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, where she leads the AI Innovation Lab. AI systems must be trustworthy, she said: \"valid and reliable, safe, secure, and resilient, privacy enhanced, interpretable and explainable fair with harmful bias managed and accountable and transparent.\"\n\nFor AI systems to be trustworthy requires interrogation of its many inputs and impacts, speakers said, highlighting such issues as AI's environmental impacts and the unequal access to computational systems.\n\nFor Gil, this is a critical issue. \"Even the best universities\" he said, \"cannot reproduce the state-of-the-art results created by industry or truly push the frontiers of these large language models.\" The computational power required makes it impossible for government or academic researchers to keep pace without exceptional funding.\n\nIt is also significant whose data is included, whose is not and how it was acquired, said Arti Garg, head of Technology Strategy & Evaluation for Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Office of the CTO and a AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowships alumna. She cited a definition newly published by the World Economic Forum's Global Futures Council on Data Equity: \"Data equity can be defined as the shared responsibility for fair data practices that respect and promote human rights, opportunity and dignity.\"\n\n\"Data are the lifeblood of AI,\" she upheld. \"You can't train an AI model without data. And at the end of the day, what are most AI models? They're sort of just correlations based on mathematical representations you made of the underlying data set.\"\n\nSpeakers also called for measurable standards to best understand AI and its impacts and to provide guidance for trustworthy use. As Garg noted, standards to measure the environmental impacts of AI, for instance, do not currently exist. Tabassi added that it is necessary to understand what makes up trustworthiness in a measurable sense.\n\nSaid Tabassi, \"If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it.\"\n\nA significant portion of the event brought participants together around plausible actions and solutions relevant to the real-time opportunities and challenges of AI. Speakers emphasized the importance of providing science-informed input on this evolving sector.\n\nTabassi cited work that NIST has undertaken to offer guidance on AI, including a generative AI public working group that brought together 2,500 public volunteers to consider risks created or exacerbated by generative AI.\n\nEmphasizing the need for more intentional policy that connects resources from governmental bodies, universities and businesses, Gil maintained \"It's about educating together and building together.\"\n\n\"You can build the future,\" echoed Sudip Parikh, AAAS chief executive officer and executive publisher of the Science family of journals, to Forum attendees.\n\nHorvitz sees that future as a hopeful one.\n\n\"The next 50 years will be remembered as a significant time of an upswing of AI innovation and influence,\" he said. \"We're truly only at the foothills of an AI era in the sciences.\"", "source": {"uri": "aaas.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "American

However, it represents a tremendous opportunity to enhance the learning experience. As an educator and student, we believe AI can complement, not replace, human teaching, opening new possibilities for interactive and personalized learning.\n\nAI models, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to become the next great equalizer by making knowledge more accessible to everyone. Students can use artificial intelligence as their own personal tutors, allowing them to ask questions and strengthen their understanding of a subject. However, the potential to be misused -- such as having AI do their assignments for them -- raises concern. Many people are fearful rather than excited about this new technology, and we can't blame them. The capabilities of AI advance at an accelerated rate every day.\n\nBut before AI chatbots, the internet democratized access to information. Before that, periodicals and books played a role. Each technological advancement has brought knowledge closer to the masses. However, the introduction of AI chatbots takes this a step further by providing customized answers to specific questions. This shift from passive consumption of information to interactive engagement marks a significant milestone in our educational evolution, empowering all individuals to access personalized knowledge at their fingertips.\n\nNot everyone shares our enthusiasm for AI. It appears that professions that once demanded an immense amount of skill and were considered impossible to automate can now be done by AI in mere seconds. The advent of AI models capable of generating realistic videos and performing complex tasks in seconds exacerbates these concerns. We believe it's crucial to address these fears head-on. Critical thinking, problem-solving, and human interaction remain irreplaceable. AI should augment our abilities, not replace them.\n\nCritical questions arise with AI's growing capabilities: What is the role of critical thinking when AI can handle complex analysis? How do we maintain genuine human relationships when AI can simulate empathy and understanding? We must ensure AI does not erode our social fabric. Instead, it should enhance our ability to connect and empathize with each other. As technology evolves, so must our approach to education and interpersonal skills.\n\nGiven the vast capabilities of artificial intelligence, how can we compete with such a technology? The key to thriving in an AI-driven world is not competition but collaboration. AI is simply a technology that uses its knowledge to provide us with solutions to our problems. It can't think, feel, or the desire to improve the world around us. And that's where we come in: we have the ability and the desire to change the world around us. By finding solutions to our problems faster, we can spend less time on what is tedious and more time on fixing more important issues.\n\nTo succeed in the future, embracing lifelong learning and adaptability is essential. Specific skills may become automated, but the ability to learn new ones and adapt to changing environments will always be valuable. A lifelong learning mentality ensures we remain relevant and capable of overcoming new challenges. Educators and policymakers must prioritize teaching these adaptive skills alongside technological literacy.\n\nAs we navigate the era of AI, we must equip everyone -- not just students -- with the skills to leverage new technologies effectively. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and ethical AI use, we can turn potential threats into opportunities for growth and innovation.

Here's how it's impacting business and academia.", "body": "Highlighting the exponential growth of artificial intelligence, Verbit analyzed a Stanford University report to see how the world of AI is changing. - Shutterstock // metamorworks\n\nFor decades, the field of artificial intelligence seemed stagnant. Researchers started gaining momentum in the early 2010s as deep learning proved useful in real-world applications such as speech recognition. The real inflection point, however, did not come until November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nThe chatbot represented a huge leap in AI's capabilities. The ability to build intelligent systems out of computer chips, a goal that seemed decades away, now seems within reach. ChatGPT's advanced natural language processing abilities showcased the potential for AI to comprehend and generate human-like text, proving to be a versatile tool for a plethora of applications from customer service to content creation.\n\nThis technology has drastically changed the field of AI, driving activity in both the private sector and academia. Major technology companies and startups are investing heavily in AI development, creating a competitive landscape in the field. Universities are also ramping up their AI research programs to keep pace with industry advancements. According to the 2024 Stanford AI Index Report, this frenzy is reshaping industries through a surge in startup formation and accelerated research efforts.\n\nVerbit analyzed Stanford's AI Index Report to better understand how AI has changed in recent years and highlighted the exponential growth in AI-related publications and patents.\n\nThe Stanford report shows a nuanced picture of how the technology sector is changing in light of the AI boom. Overall global corporate investment in AI actually peaked in 2021 and has fallen the past two years, down to $235 billion in 2022 and $189 billion in 2023.\n\nIn part, this decline can be attributed to high interest rates. In 2022, central banks around the world started to combat inflation by raising interest rates. This in turn has made companies more hesitant to make as many large-scale investments as they otherwise would have.\n\nBut investors may have reason to be wary; many high-profile AI companies have struggled to stay afloat despite producing innovative technology. Take, for instance, Stability AI, the creators of a leading image-generation model. The company raised funds at a $1 billion valuation in 2022 but has struggled to turn a profit. According to reports by Reuters and The Information, the company recently installed a new CEO, raised $80 million, and settled about $400 million in debt.\n\nInflection AI, the startup behind the chatbot Pi, raised $1.3 billion in 2023 at a $4 billion valuation but has been unable to find a business model. In March 2024, Microsoft, which had previously invested in Inflection AI, all but acquired the company, according to Bloomberg. The Washington-based tech giant agreed to pay Inflection $650 million to license its technology and hire most of its employees.\n\nThough overall investments in AI declined, generative AI is an exception to this downturn. Investment in generative systems that create text and images soared to $25 billion in 2023, up from roughly $3 billion a year earlier. Business formation is also trending upward. About 1,800 new AI companies received funding in 2023, an increase of about 40% from 2022.\n\nThe U.S. has by far the hottest AI market, accounting for $67 billion of investment in 2023, compared with just $7.8 billion in China and $3.8 billion in the United Kingdom. U.S.-based institutions were behind 61 notable AI models in 2023, compared with China (15), France (8), and Germany (5), according to the Stanford report. America's dominance is not without precedent: The country has led in private AI investment since 2013 -- a gap that has only widened in recent years.\n\nThe generative AI boom has significantly impacted the academic research landscape. According to the latest data, academic journal articles in the field surged to over 240,000 in 2022, marking a dramatic 175% increase from 2010. Machine learning studies have seen particularly explosive growth, with publications soaring from around 6,000 in 2010 to over 70,000 in 2022, underscoring the rapid advancement and growing interest in the sector.\n\nThe surge of interest in AI has also changed where academic research is done. Up until the mid-2010s, most leading machine learning models came from academia. However, university researchers now lag behind their private-sector counterparts because they have only a fraction of the resources in comparison.\n\nTech companies can offer researchers much higher salaries -- and massive amounts of compute. GPT-4, the model behind ChatGPT, has been estimated to cost $78 million to train, while Google's Gemini Ultra has been estimated to cost $191 million. These numbers are high in the corporate world but would be considered astronomical in academia.\n\nAll of the commercial interest in AI has come with a cost. Historically, researchers have been keen to share their models and data with others. But industrial labs, which have invested billions in research and development, are much more cautious about collaboration. OpenAI, for instance, was founded as a nonprofit to share its work with the public out of fears that one leading tech company might monopolize the technology. It open-sourced GPT-2, an earlier chat model, but has since declined to share its models with the public, citing safety concerns.\n\nOther researchers have followed suit. In February of last year, Google's head of artificial intelligence announced his staff should hold off on publishing their work, marking a sharp reversal of their policy pre-ChatGPT. Google, whose researchers made many of the discoveries driving current generative AI models, has so far failed to capitalize on its work, despite a generous head start.\n\nFrancois Chollet, a computer scientist at Google, recently lamented on a podcast that \"frontier research was no longer being published,\" blaming OpenAI for creating the current competitive dynamics.\n\nThe AI sector is booming.

It spotlighted risks from misuse or loss of control of so-called frontier AI systems with dangerous capabilities. But the momentum generated by the summit faces a bump in the road: France, the host of the next summit in February 2025, has deprioritized those risks in order to elevate its own vision for the future of AI governance. This vision, rooted in the principles of openness and innovation, appears at least in part designed to oppose the U.S. and UK's securitization of the space. It's an appealing message, and France is well-placed to push it -- but it needs some polishing before it can be a compelling alternative for the global community.\n\nThe U.S. and UK's push for attention on frontier AI risks culminated in the Bletchley Declaration, a joint statement signed by twenty-eight countries at the UK summit, including France. But as the framing motivates domestic and international policy (the most substantial elements being voluntary commitments from leading AI companies and the establishment of national AI Safety Institutes), France has resisted. Despite being champions of EU digital regulation, France almost sank the EU's AI Act when it sought to weaken new restrictions on powerful AI systems. And although France has signed the international declarations positing the grave threats AI may pose to humanity, it has downplayed those risks at the same time.\n\nReasonable people can disagree about the severity and imminence of risks from frontier models' advanced capabilities. But the key geopolitical issue remains the resulting regulatory actions. An influential report by France's government-appointed AI commission offers a window into France's concerns. The report, led by the same person responsible for organizing the French summit, largely dismisses the risks as hype. Instead, it suggests directly and indirectly that the risks are being used to legitimize barriers to entry that would lead to the concentration of AI development in the already dominant players. In large part, these are U.S. big tech companies and AI startups.\n\nA recent U.S. executive order, for example, requires U.S. providers of computing infrastructure to report to the U.S. government when foreign actors train powerful AI models -- a regulation nominally motivated by the risks these models pose. The French AI commission report labels this an attempt to slow down foreign AI development, facilitate economic espionage, and reinforce American domination (apparently unimpressed by the reporting requirements the United States also imposed on its own AI companies).\n\nThis possibility is especially grating to Paris. President Emmanuel Macron, in Gaullist tradition, has repeatedly advocated for a more multipolar world and a European \"third way,\" separate from the United States or China. In response, France's rallying call is for an \"open\" innovation ecosystem that avoids the network effects and concentration that have kept away challengers to U.S. big tech. This is not a new look for France: Macron has been promoting openness in the AI space since at least 2018. And outside of AI, Paris has emphasized the development of open-source software and digital commons as key components of building European and French sovereignty for at least a decade.\n\nFrance is uniquely well-suited to champion this position and become a lasting force in global AI governance. On innovation, although far from leading, France is a credible player. The French AI startup Mistral, whose strategy prominently features open-source AI, was recently valued at $2 billion and is building globally competitive, state-of-the-art models. According to Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI 2024 AI Index report, France is third in the world in terms of producing notable models, behind the United States and China.\n\nGlobally, France has influence. It's a key member of the organizations driving research, global principles, debate, and even regulatory efforts on AI, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, the AI summits, and the G7 -- and, of course, the EU. Being less closely associated with big tech interests, and being in a position where, like many, it can't take the strength of its domestic AI industry for granted, France may better represent the global community than the United States. Global powers such as China and India have also found France to be a more reliable and less judgmental partner than Washington or Brussels. As a case in point, France and China published a joint declaration on global governance of AI in early May. France's streamlined executive power typically helps ensure internal politics do not derail partnerships.\n\nWhat's left for France is to leverage its position and create a compelling path forward for the global community. Given that many countries' biggest concern with AI is missing out on its opportunities, openness and innovation are more inspiring than a focus on future risks. South Korea's interim summit dropped \"safety\" from the name and added innovation and inclusion as core pillars. But to build a coalition, France will need to convince others that its concerns are genuine -- and not simply about protecting France's own would-be international AI champions.\n\nGoing further, France will need to convince others that there is value in resisting U.S.- and UK-led securitization of the space. Otherwise, security-focused regulatory approaches will be all too easy to accept as the price of access to the technology, even if they end up concentrating development in a few countries.\n\nOn risks, Paris needs to go further than simply denying the current framing. Although the French AI commission's report calls existential risks from powerful AI systems hypothetical, France has public and expert opinion to contend with, both of which point to caution. France is also subject to the EU's AI Act, which is set to regulate misuse and loss of control risks from powerful models, among many other risks. Trying to renege on previous areas of agreement is more likely to antagonize allies and sow confusion than lend credibility to its vision.\n\nInstead, France will need to offer an affirmative vision for addressing AI's risks. One approach would be to include risks that are more salient to the international community. The French AI commission's report has started this, arguing that existential risks from powerful AI systems should not drive policy and instead emphasizing broad risks such as concentration of power over AI systems, labor disruptions, and the erasure of languages and cultures. Work remains in highlighting that the solutions to those are tangential to, or even in tension with, the securitization of the space -- and that France's call for open and collaborative innovation ecosystems is a better solution.\n\nFrance's AI summit will be a unique chance to reshape the global AI conversation around principles of openness and innovation, as well as an opportunity to cement itself as a leader in the space. France's message has the potential to be compelling to many, and it has the influence and credibility required to promulgate it. But to do so, France will need to make the value proposition for others more concrete and navigate a shift in focus without antagonizing allies.", "source": {"uri": "carnegieendowment.org",

Every day, we're interacting with tools that would've looked like science fiction only a few years ago. Generative AI can do everything from providing your child with a personalised tutor to designing novel medicines.\n\nUnfortunately, all this is at risk thanks to a new bill in California known as SB-1047, which threatens to stifle AI development.\n\nIf it passes it will have a chilling effect not only on AI investment but the entrepreneurship that drives technological advancement around the world.\n\nMore than 600 AI bills have been proposed by state legislators in the US this year but SB-1047 goes further than most. It requires developers to certify that their AI models cannot be used to cause harm. This is an unobtainable requirement.\n\nAI models can be modified infinitely. Open-source models allow the public to access and build on their source code, meaning developers could bear responsibility for third parties. It is impossible to guarantee that no version of an AI model could ever cause harm. The bill is a fundamental misunderstanding of the technology.\n\nThe bill also claims to only target large tech companies. However, it uses a $100mn \"training cost\" threshold to determine a company's size. AI development costs run to billions, meaning this relatively low bar could affect start-ups. There is no clear definition of training costs, either. This is especially problematic as we are still in the early research phase of AI, when terms like pre-training and post-training lack universal definitions.\n\nThe California state senate has already approved a version of the bill. In August, this poorly considered, deeply disruptive proposal could move to the desk of Governor Gavin Newsom, who could sign it into law.\n\nThe AI community has tried to sound the alarm. More than 100 AI leaders have signed an open letter opposing the bill.\n\nYann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist, has warned that the bill's \"cascading liability clauses would make it very risky to open-source AI platforms\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Meta will be fine, but AI start-ups will just die.\"\n\nAs an AI investor, I've already witnessed the ill effects of the bill first hand. Promising open-source start-ups are considering relocating overseas. We risk a brain drain, with top talent fleeing to more accommodating jurisdictions.\n\nThe global implications are stark. While China's policymakers collaborate closely with AI researchers, US legislators, however well intentioned, are writing laws without serious collaboration from AI's expert developers, investors or researchers. It's akin to writing medical regulations without consulting doctors.\n\nThe consequences could be severe and widespread. As US AI development stalls, global competitors will seize the advantage and groundbreaking ideas will be stifled before they have a chance to develop.\n\nWe need rational AI regulation. We should focus on misuses of AI models by enforcing greater penalties for AI-enabled crimes, such as non-consensual deep fakes. We could establish industry-wide standards for transparency around how big AI models are trained too, and fund security and safety research at public universities.\n\nThese measures would promote responsible development while preserving the flexibility needed for breakthroughs.\n\nCalifornia's well-intentioned but misinformed anti-AI bill threatens to undermine the US tech industry just as the future of the technology is at a crossroads. We need our leaders to recognise that the time for informed, united action on AI regulation is now.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreessen_Horowitz", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andreessen Horowitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Source code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yann LeCun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human capital flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fa6fc6bd5-ed7b-4ae3-974a-4753486b2bae.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Investment managers aren't the only ones to engage in such tactics. Companies, including Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's, and H&M, have been widely criticized for boasting about their use of AI in their marketing to position their products as innovative and futuristic -- without providing transparency into the specific AI capabilities behind their efforts.\n\nAI does add a certain sheen -- at least to the words. Just read a press release for Coca\u2011Cola Y3000 Zero Sugar: The company invites \"fans to imagine what the future tastes and feels like with a limited-edition drink and new AI-powered experience.\" But the release didn't give any details about the AI or the role AI played in the product's creation.\n\nThe United States consumer protection agency, the Federal Trade Commission, has made AI washing a priority, warning companies across the economy that \"if you think you can get away with baseless claims that your product is AI-enabled, think again. ... Before labeling your product as AI-powered, note also that merely using an AI tool in the development process is not the same as a product having AI in it.\"\n\nThe commission fulfilled this promise by taking enforcement action against several companies, including Automators AI. In commenting on the lawsuit, Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said, \"The defendants preyed on consumers looking to provide for their families with promises of high returns and the use of AI to power such returns. Their lies caused consumers to lose tens of thousands of dollars, with many losing their life savings. The FTC is working to hold defendants accountable and to secure redress for their victims.\"\n\nFellow regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission have also been cracking down on investment managers' and advisers' false or misleading claims of AI use. In December 2023, the SEC's Division of Examinations initiated an AI sweep. In this formal process, the commission requested information from investment advisers on their use of AI-based tools. In March, the SEC announced \"settled charges against two investment advisers, Delphia (USA) Inc. and Global Predictions Inc., for making false and misleading statements about their purported use of artificial intelligence (AI). The firms agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay $400,000 in total civil penalties.\"\n\nDirector of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, Gurbir Grewal, underscored the SEC's commitment to safeguarding investors against AI washing in his announcement of the settlements, stating, \"As more and more investors consider using AI tools in making their investment decisions or deciding to invest in companies claiming to harness its transformational power, we are committed to protecting them against those engaged in 'AI washing.' As today's enforcement actions make clear to the investment industry - if you claim to use AI in your investment processes, you need to ensure that your representations are not false or misleading. And public issuers making claims about their AI adoption must also remain vigilant about similar misstatements that may be material to individuals' investing decisions.\"\n\nAs the co-founder of a genuine AI-based investment manager, I regularly review managers' white papers and presentations that mention their use of AI, canvass their hires for evidence of expertise in advanced data science, and participate on conference panels where our fellow panelists make broad, unspecified claims about their adoption of AI. With few exceptions, I find a paucity of evidence indicating the actual incorporation of AI into managers' investment processes.\n\nTheir claims generally come down to \"We've started using alternative data\" or \"We use AI to scrape the web for data we input into our models.\" Some simply point to their hiring of data scientists with no reference to their roles or contribution; others mention they are using Large Language Models usually to improve an operational function. (As one commentator cogently explains, \"Having your team type in 'import openai' does not mean that you are at the cutting-edge of artificial intelligence.\")\n\nThe most brazen managers simply appropriate the term \"machine learning,\" asserting that traditional quantitative processes such as cluster analysis or linear regression qualify as AI. A former colleague provided a humorous analogy for this practice: \"Anything that's even remotely quantitative can be called 'machine learning' -- the plain vanilla cluster analysis they teach in undergrad stats... But it's a bit like saying that a Ukrainian sustenance farmer is doing genetic engineering by planting the biggest potatoes from last year's harvest.\"\n\nAllocators have grown weary of managers professing their AI bona fides. As an unnamed allocator told Trusted Insights, \"I'm interested in AI and big data if they are right for a particular strategy. However, I want to hear more than buzz words from managers -- I'm looking for a lucid explanation of how it's going to help me and be additive to our strategies.\"\n\nThe SEC's explicit effort to identify and penalize managers who make misleading AI claims is topical and timely. A recent study found that 33 percent of asset managers are experimenting with AI, while 36 percent are actively using AI. However, because it took the SEC several years to finalize rules standardizing even climate-related disclosure for investment managers, it will likely be some time before the SEC codifies the standard of disclosure for AI use, leaving allocators to rely on their own due diligence to verify managers' AI claims.", "source": {"uri": "institutionalinvestor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Institutional Investor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pepsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H&M", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H&M"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "False advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurbir_Grewal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gurbir Grewal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linear regression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cluster analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.assetmg.info/dims4/default/5fd27c3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x506+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-in-investor-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F61%2Ff5b3e33849a1904d3c111d96a8fa%2Fbigstock-ai-washing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

This article delves into the innovative metrics and frameworks proposed by Vinay Puri to measure AI's impact on productivity comprehensively. Puri, a renowned expert from Florida International University, provides insights and practical strategies to quantify the multifaceted effects of AI initiatives within organizations.\n\nThe Potential and Challenges of AI Integration\n\nAI integration into organizational workflows promises significant productivity gains, ranging from automating routine tasks to providing advanced analytics. However, realizing these benefits requires careful measurement and evaluation. A recent study by Accenture indicates that AI could boost labor productivity by up to 40% by 2035, underscoring its vast potential. Yet, many organizations struggle to quantify the specific impacts of their AI investments. According to a NewVantage Partners survey, only 31% of firms consider themselves data-driven, highlighting a significant gap between AI adoption and measurable outcomes.\n\nThe complexities of measuring AI's impact on productivity are multifaceted. AI often affects multiple aspects of an organization simultaneously, making it difficult to isolate its specific contributions. For instance, an AI-powered customer service chatbot may reduce response times, improve customer satisfaction, and free up human agents for more complex tasks. Quantifying these interrelated effects requires a holistic approach.\n\nInnovative Metrics for Measuring AI Impact\n\nVinay Puri introduces innovative metrics to comprehensively assess AI's impact on organizational productivity across several dimensions. The Task Complexity Index (TCI) evaluates how AI enables employees to shift from low to high-complexity tasks, exemplified by a financial services company increasing its TCI from 4.2 to 7.1 with AI implementation. The Quality Consistency Score (QCS) measures reductions in product variability, as seen when an automotive parts manufacturer improved its QCS from 82% to 95% through AI-driven quality control.\n\nThe AI Value Creation Index (AVCI) combines cost savings, revenue growth, and intangible benefits; a retail company used it to prioritize a customer recommendation system with an AVCI of 85. The AI Innovation Diffusion Rate (AIDR) tracks the spread of AI innovations, illustrated by a multinational consumer goods company's market trend prediction tool adoption rate increasing from 30% to 75% in a year.\n\nBest Practices for AI Impact Measurement\n\nImplementing robust measurement methodologies and addressing common challenges are crucial for effectively assessing AI's impact on productivity. The Baseline Stability Index (BSI) assesses the reliability of pre-AI metrics to ensure consistent and representative baseline data for accurate comparisons. For instance, a telecommunications company extended its baseline measurement period for customer churn rate to achieve a stable comparison point.\n\nDynamic A/B Testing continuously optimizes the allocation of users to test groups based on real-time performance data, enabling more efficient and responsive testing of AI systems. An online education platform used this method to validate its AI-powered course recommendation system's effectiveness. AI Impact Network Analysis maps the ripple effects of AI implementations across departments and processes, offering a comprehensive view of AI's organizational impact.\n\nCombining multiple performance indicators into a single metric, AI System Health Scores allow for quick identification of AI systems needing attention. A financial institution used this approach for monitoring various AI applications, including fraud detection and chatbots. Additionally, AI Sentiment Analysis Framework processes and quantifies qualitative feedback from stakeholders, turning subjective insights into actionable metrics. A healthcare provider improved patient sentiment scores by implementing a patient education program about AI in healthcare.\n\nThe Long-Term and Ethical Considerations of AI\n\nThe dynamic nature of AI necessitates a flexible and adaptive approach to productivity measurement. As new AI capabilities emerge, organizations must continuously update their measurement frameworks to capture potential impacts. Additionally, ethical considerations and societal impact should be integral to AI impact measurement. Metrics should incentivize responsible AI use and consider potential negative externalities.\n\nIn conclusion, successfully measuring AI's productivity impact requires a multifaceted approach combining rigorous statistical methods, adaptive measurement frameworks, and ethical considerations. By implementing the proposed metrics and best practices, organizations can better understand the value of their AI investments, make informed decisions about future AI initiatives, and navigate the evolving landscape of AI-driven productivity enhancement.\n\nBy adopting this comprehensive and nuanced approach to defining productivity in the context of AI, organizations can more accurately assess the true impact of their AI initiatives and make informed decisions about future investments and strategies.\n\nRead More From Techbullion And Businesnewswire.com\n\nRelated Items:Ethical, Practices

But as the technology rapidly changes, it is not clear how this would work or what it will mean for teachers and learners.\n\nScience Minister Judith Collins' vision is for every student to have their own AI tutor. As Collins explained in a recent interview,\n\nSo instead of having to be wealthy enough to employ a tutor to help the children with the maths or science questions, or something else that the parent doesn't know much about maybe, is to enable that child to have their own [AI] tutor.\n\nBut like AI itself, the concept of an AI tutor is still evolving. The idea of creating a \"teaching machine\" has been around for 100 years or so, and \"intelligent tutoring systems\" have been around since the 1980s with limited results.\n\nThe more recent advances of AI have rekindled the elusive promises of these systems. But while the technology has evolved, the basic concept of a machine taking over some of the responsibilities of the teacher has remained the same.\n\nAI tutors for kids, medical analysis part of NZ's future - Judith Collins \"Collins told RNZ she already uses ChatGPT to write drafts of her speeches.\" https://t.co/8j0QIzeRVH -- Farah (@KiwiFarah)\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nAn AI tutor is a proxy for a human tutor -- supporting and \"scaffolding\" a student's learning. Scaffolding is the space between what a learner can do without assistance and what they can learn next with the support of someone who is more knowledgeable.\n\nIn theory, an AI Tutor can play this role. But there are inherent dangers. What if your more knowledgeable tutor is not, in fact, more knowledgeable, but just makes things up? Or shows bias? Or favours uncritical, shallow material over more reliable resources?\n\nThe features that give generative AI its capabilities to interact with users also create its flaws. AI relies on the data it is trained on. However, this data can be wrong, and AI neither validates what goes into it, nor what comes out.\n\nThis issue has raised concerns about fairness. As AI tools consume quantities of unfiltered data, the risk is they will reinforce existing biases in this data, perpetuating gender stereotypes and other negative outcomes.\n\nFor people from Indigenous cultures, including M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples, AI provides both opportunities and threats.\n\nIf AI systems are trained on biased data or without considering diverse perspectives, there is a high likelihood decisions being made based on these systems will favour one group over others, reinforce stereotypes, and ignore or undervalue different ways of living and thinking.\n\nThe concern isn't just about the influence AI can have on us but also how AI consumes and processes data. AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, often without properly acknowledging the sources or respecting creators' copyrights.\n\nFor Indigenous peoples, this can infringe upon their data sovereignty rights and exploit their cultural and knowledge heritage. This exploitation can perpetuate inequality and undermine the rights and contributions of Indigenous communities.\n\nA \"walled garden\" approach\n\nA commonly proposed answer to this problem is to train AI systems on carefully curated data.\n\nBook publisher Pearson, for example, has recently integrated AI in 50 of their textbooks. This allows students to use AI chatbots to engage with the texts.\n\nAccording to Pearson, these tools are developed using a \"walled garden\" approach. The AI is trained only on the contents of these books. This, Pearson claims, reduces the risks of inaccuracies.\n\nHowever, the walled garden approach also has major drawbacks, since it limits content to that selected and approved by the supplier. What does this mean for cultural knowledge and rights? Critical perspectives? Innovation in learning?\n\nPearson has, for example, been criticised for the content of some of its books. In 2017, the company apologised for a medical textbook considered \"racist\".\n\nIf a New Zealand AI tutor were to be created from local data, how could we ensure tikanga M\u0101ori protocols are safeguarded? As highlighted by M\u0101ori scholar Te Hurinui Clarke, there are significant challenges around the respectful and ethical handling of M\u0101ori knowledge.\n\nProtecting knowledge\n\nWhen it comes to AI tutors, policy makers need to ask who would be the custodians of this data, whose knowledge would be used and who has the rights to access?\n\nIf done well, a walled garden approach might provide a comprehensive, inclusive, culturally sustaining pathway to better learning. However, given the challenges of such an undertaking (never mind the expense), the chances of success in practice are extremely small.\n\nMeanwhile, we can't just wait for AI tutors. AI is a reality in schools, and we need to prepare students for what they face now and in the future. Specific tools are important, but our focus should be on developing AI literacy across the educational sector.\n\nThis is why we are researching what it means to be AI literate and how this can empower critical evaluation and ethical use, ensuring AI complements rather than replaces human teaching.\n\nWe see the development of AI literacy, supported by suitable frameworks, as a priority, something all students, no matter their age, need to have. It is only through this that we can harness AI's benefits while safeguarding the core values of education.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Judith Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_New_Zealand", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasifika_New_Zealanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pasifika New Zealanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101ori_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101ori people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikanga_M\u0101ori", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tikanga M\u0101ori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/metaDefault2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Business uptake of AI continues to increase at pace, with a nearly 40% increase in UK companies reporting using AI between 2022 and 2023 according to IBM research. But what impact is this all really having on in-house privacy teams and how can they best ensure they are facilitators rather than blockers of AI and innovation?\n\nChallenges posed by the current landscape\n\nWhile AI has been a focus for data privacy regulators for some time, with extensive guidance produced by the ICO for example, it often remains difficult to find straightforward solutions to the challenges posed. Many of the 'meatier' issues haven't been fully addressed in regulatory or court decisions yet and guidance (including from non-data regulators too) is evolving. For example the ICO's guidance on genAI is still at the consultation stage, as we discuss here. In any case, privacy teams must apply the guidance to the facts for each use case and they are often coming under increasing pressure to do so in short-time frames driven by business appetite for AI tools.\n\nEvolving roles in AI governance\n\nExperience and skills built up by privacy teams over the years mean that many of them are being called upon to lead on, or at least be heavily involved with, AI. Having said that, responsibilities and reporting lines vary extensively between businesses. Regardless of precise structuring, it is crucial privacy teams avoid working in silos as AI (and genAI in particular) requires cross-team working, including with technical and specialist project teams.\n\nRoutes forward? Leveraging existing GDPR compliance for AI (and vice-versa)\n\nPrivacy compliance programmes can be leveraged to cover AI, for example DPIAs and supplier onboarding processes can be expanded to avoid duplication of documentation. There are also opportunities to leverage the business interest in AI to create a more proactive environment where privacy teams become involved early on, helping assess risk and ensuring privacy by design. While there is yet no consensus that the EU AI Act will become the global gold-standard for AI, aspects of the Act are likely to filter through the market to inform compliance even by those not caught by its scope.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initial coin offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy by design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filter (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Several high-profile companies have recently announced plans to increase the use of automation and AI, resulting in workforce reductions.\n\nIBM is planning to lay off around 10,000 employees across Europe. Similarly, Amazon has announced that it will terminate hundreds of jobs in sectors requiring physical labor to maximize efficiency from AI-focused processes. Digital media company BuzzFeed revealed that it laid off 12% of its workforce last December and an additional 15% in April.\n\nThe company also plans to shut down its news unit, BuzzFeed News. Walt Disney, one of the largest companies in the US entertainment industry, has announced plans to lay off 7,000 employees and eliminate $5.5 billion in costs. In response to AI's negative impacts on employment, some governments are taking steps to mitigate these effects.\n\nThe EU recently launched the Digital Europe Program, aimed at investing in digital skills training and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in adapting to digital transformation.\n\n'AI will be transformative for many professions' Ugur Karaboga, managing Partner at T\u00fcrkiye's job search and career development platform Yenibiris, said generative AI applications \"will automate routine and repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency while still necessitating human labor.\"\n\n\"While efficiency in routine tasks will increase, we cannot ignore the need for human power to use this technology and the fact that there are human elements in some service areas that machines cannot perform,\" Karaboga told Anadolu, emphasizing the need for both employers and employees to be prepared for this transformative process.\n\nRegardless of the processes and development of AI, it will always be necessary to offer personalized services, understand customer needs, and manage complex situations, he said.\n\n\"The important thing is how we adapt to this process.\" AI has been affecting various sectors differently, Karaboga said, highlighting significant progress in automation of routine tasks in production and logistics services. However, he believes that both sides of the workforce must make significant efforts to keep up with changes and stay competitive.\n\n\"What does this effort entail? Of course, it involves diversifying education and development opportunities to attract and retain the right talents. Talent shortages are a major issue in the new world. With access to talent becoming more challenging, we must successfully incorporate highly skilled young people from different fields into the workforce. We need to engage with them frequently and understand their expectations from the business world,\" Karaboga said.\n\nHe added that AI will transform many professions, with data mining being one of the foremost fields. 'Generative AI will affect mental labor experts more' Fatih Uysal, CEO of Kariyer.net, another Turkish online job search and career development platform, shared the results of an analysis conducted by the company on the changes and transformations in the employment market.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the demand for AI-related positions by employers increased by 81%, while the supply for these roles rose by 11%. Uysal said that these results indicate a growing need for candidates with AI skills in the future, with some professions requiring new skills and others disappearing entirely.\n\nHe pointed out that the technology, media, and digital industries will be the most affected by automation and AI developments in the global labor market.\n\n\"Previously, AI was thought to develop automation mainly in blue-collar positions. However, today, it is said that generative AI will affect mental labor experts more,\" he said.\n\nReferring to a report by global management consulting firm McKinsey, he said that jobs requiring a high level of education have the highest potential for automation with generative AI.\n\nAccording to the report, while 54% of jobs requiring a high school diploma or less can be automated without generative AI, this rate jumps to 63% with generative AI. For master's and doctoral-level jobs, this rate rises from 28% to 57%.\n\n\"Therefore, highly educated candidates will need to develop their AI skills in the coming period,\" Uysal said. Uysal highlighted that as AI technologies advance, new career opportunities will arise.\n\n\"As generative AI integrates and develops within business processes, existing jobs are transforming, and new job fields are emerging. It is possible to see positions like Prompt Engineering, Data Labeling, Data Cleaning, AI Legal Compliance Specialist, AI Trainer, AI-Supported Solution Experts in Health and Customer Relations, and many bot/assistant services emerging,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue-collar worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_consulting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Management consulting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/thumbs_b_c_588d9be302865641adb59211e32986891721934071-0/thumbs_b_c_588d9be302865641adb59211e32986891721934071-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Her insights were drawn from her keynote address at Google's Accelerate in AI Action event held at the Century City Hotel, where she drew attention to the tangible benefits of AI for businesses and society. \"Our goal is to demystify AI and showcase its tangible benefits for businesses and society,\" she said.\n\nThis expanding access mission was the driving force behind the two-day event that drew attendees from across Africa, including Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, to learn from Google's AI experts and explore the latest advancements in AI technology.\n\n\"AI is not just a futuristic concept; it's here and now, making a difference in our daily lives,\" Baez explained as she introduced the \"WINS\" framework - words, images, numbers, and sounds - to illustrate how AI can be integrated into everyday activities, urging attendees to explore AI's capabilities both personally and professionally.\n\nBaez was also not short on examples of AI in action, showcasing how AI can enhance business strategies, improve customer engagement, and drive innovation.\n\n\"From predictive to generative AI, we are seeing incredible success stories from brands and marketers who are adopting these technologies,\" she noted.\n\nIn a personal anecdote she described using Google's AI tool, Gemini, to plan a seamless and personalised travel itinerary in Cape Town to explore the Stellenbosch winelands and the city's cultural history\n\nAddressing AI's impact on critical sectors like healthcare and disaster management, Baez highlighted significant advancements.\n\n\"AI is revolutionising healthcare by accelerating drug discovery and improving patient outcomes,\" she explained.\n\nShe cited Google's Climate AI project as an example of AI's predictive capabilities in disaster management, which helps governments and communities prepare for natural disasters like floods.\n\nAI is also core to Google's SME support strategy, with Baez responding to inquiries about the search giant's efforts to help these businesses integrate AI and improve their search engine optimisation (SEO).\n\n\"We're committed to empowering SMEs with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed,\" she assured.\n\nIn response to questions from Bizcommunity about Google's assistance to university researchers in adopting AI, Baez highlighted the organic uptake of AI in education.\n\n\"Educators are being forced to adopt AI whether they like it or not,\" she said.\n\nBaez recounted a university professor's innovative approach to grading, where the prompt used in AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini is valued more than the response, indicating a deep understanding of the subject matter.\n\nBaez's insights align with Google's broader vision for AI, which aims to leverage technology for positive change.\n\nGoogle's strategic focus includes advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through AI, as outlined by Dr James Manyika, Google Research's senior vice president, in a related presentation.\n\nThis vision encompasses AI's role in healthcare, education, environmental sustainability, and disaster management, emphasising AI's broad applicability and potential to address global challenges.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, Google's says it remains committed to democratising access to AI and ensuring its benefits reach everyone.\n\nAlthough these benefits seem limited to wider adoption of Gemini, there is a lot of work happening at the data centre level to reduce the cost of compute.\n\nThrough initiatives like its AI research centre in Ghana and collaborations with various organisations, Google is promoting using AI for social good.\n\nYvette Baez's visit to Cape Town is another step to promoting AI adoption as a tool for positive change, fostering innovation, and driving sustainable development.", "source": {"uri": "bizcommunity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bizcommunity.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Yet significant challenges and risks are attached to wide scale adoption, including the reliance on a handful of machine learning datasets in the case of generative AI.\n\nThe UK's non-statutory approach to AI regulations has meant that a lack of robust governance could pose significant risk to both adoption and deployment, as inadequate data governance can lead to biases and unethical practices, undermining the trust and reliability of AI applications in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, and public services.\n\nThe ODI also found that the UK public needs safeguarding against the risk of personal data being used illegally to train AI models, and steps must be taken to address the ongoing risks of AI models leaking personal data inadvertently via user prompts.\n\nThese risks are exacerbated by a lack of transparency that is hampering efforts to address biases, remove harmful content, and ensure compliance with legal standards.\n\nKey transparency information about data sources, copyright, and inclusion of personal information and more is rarely included by systems flagged within Partnership for AI's AI Incidents Database, which collects alerts and date designed to mitigate potential risks associated with AI.\n\nAlso key to this is an update to intellectual property law to protect creative industries.\n\nThe ODI also found that labour rights will need to be safeguarded as AI continues to be adopted and deployed, and the AI market will require scrutiny as the increasing price of high-quality AI training data excludes potential innovators and academia.\n\nBased on its research, the ODI is calling for the new government to take five actions that will allow the UK to benefit from the opportunities presented by AI while mitigating potential harms:\n\nTo provide a clearer picture of how data transparency varies across different types of system providers, the ODI is developing a new 'AI data transparency index.'\n\n\"If the UK is to benefit from the extraordinary opportunities presented by AI, the government must look beyond the hype and attend to the fundamentals of a robust data ecosystem built on sound governance and ethical foundations,\" Sir Nigel Shadbolt, executive chair and co-founder of the ODI, said.\n\n\"We must build a trustworthy data infrastructure for AI because the feedstock of high-quality AI is high-quality data.\n\n\"The UK has the opportunity to build better data governance systems for AI that ensure we are best placed to take advantage of technological innovations and create economic and social value whilst guarding against potential risks.\"\n\nBefore the General Election, Labour's Manifesto outlined plans for a National Data Library to bring together existing research programmes and help deliver data-enabled public services.\n\nHowever, the ODI says that, first, the UK government needs to ensure the data is AI-ready. As well as being accessible and trustworthy, data must meet agreed standards, which require a data assurance and quality assessment infrastructure.\n\nThe ODI's recent research has also found that currently - with a few exceptions - AI training datasets typically lack robust governance measures throughout the AI life cycle, posing safety, security, trust, and ethical challenges related to data protection and fair labour practices. These are all issues that need to be addressed if the government is to make good on its plans.", "source": {"uri": "digit.fyi", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digit"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Shadbolt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Shadbolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Institute", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open Data Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_industries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}], "image": "http://www.digit.fyi/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-2024-07-25T121136.863.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Of 298 bills with relevance for AI governance and usage introduced since the start of the 115th Congress, 183 of them were proposed after ChatGPT's launch (Figure 1). Despite a flurry of proposals and a series of nine expert AI Insight Forums convened in the Senate (and a subsequent roadmap), Congress has so far failed to pass comprehensive AI legislation. Instead, the White House has steered AI governance efforts, cutting across a wide range of executive authorities. AI policy is thus particularly vulnerable to change if there is a transition to a second Trump administration in 2025.\n\nIn July 2023, the Biden administration developed a set of Voluntary AI Commitments on safety, security, and trustworthiness with a number of leading developers. While these are not legally binding, most frontier model developers have signed on and joined an industry association to guide their implementation. The centerpiece of the Biden administration's AI policy is its October 2023 executive order, which invokes the Defense Production Act to mandate that developers of advanced AI systems share safety test results with the U.S. government, imposes know-your-customer requirements on cloud service providers, and sets standards for federal agencies on AI safety, security, and privacy. The administration also released a memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget which set forth binding guidelines on AI governance, innovation, and risk mitigation for federal agencies.\n\nBeyond domestic policy, the Biden administration has engaged in AI governance conversations in bilateral and multilateral fora, including cooperation around safe and transparent AI systems through the U.S. and European Union's Trade and Technology Council, implementation of the G7's Hiroshima Process to leverage the benefits of AI while guarding against potential harms, and cooperation on safety and evaluation standards between the U.S. AI Safety Institute and an international network of analogous organizations. The United States signed a Statement of Intent to collaborate on AI safety with other countries, committed to ongoing dialogue between the EU AI Office and U.S. AI Safety Institute, and signed a partnership agreement with the United Kingdom's AI Safety Institute, which recently announced it would open a branch in San Francisco. The United States has also worked with partners on a political declaration on AI in the military and has continued to engage at the U.N.'s Conference on Certain Conventional Weapons' Group of Governmental Experts.\n\nPerhaps most notably, the Biden administration restarted bilateral dialogues with China on key \"technical and policy\" issues, where the two sides discussed their approaches to AI safety and risk management. Despite this dialogue, the administration not only expanded Trump's tariffs in some sectors but also oversaw a \"seismic shift\" to more restrictive export controls on advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment. The administration also issued an executive order requiring outbound investment screening for critical emerging technology industries.\n\nThroughout the Biden administration, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's likely nominee for president, has taken a leading role in AI policy efforts. She led the U.S. delegation to the United Kingdom for the Global Summit on AI Safety and facilitated a dialogue with the CEOs of leading AI developers, among other roles. Absent movement in Congress, a Harris administration will continue to be limited to existing executive authorities. It will also likely maintain many of the policies of the previous administration, with the Biden executive order (EO) as a guiding document and a continued focus on risk mitigation and responsible development and investment.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has vowed to rescind the Biden EO \"on day one\" and the Republican Party platform would repeal the EO and replace it with something that supports \"AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\" This aligns with a backlash among conservative researchers, commentators, and policymakers, who have railed against the EO as an abuse of the Defense Production Act that will stifle innovation through unnecessary regulation. The most significant effect of rescinding the EO would be the end of the reporting regime for frontier model developers and cloud service providers. These requirements are one of the only legally binding transparency mechanisms for companies that develop or provide resources for the most powerful, and potentially dangerous, AI systems, and their removal would be a huge blow to the movement for guardrails on frontier AI.\n\nDespite open confrontation with China on emerging technologies and export controls, the Biden administration has engaged in dialogue on key areas of mutual concern, as evidenced by its bilateral exchanges on the climate and AI, its push to discuss nuclear risk reduction, and its participation with China in the U.K.'s AI Safety Summit and the resulting Bletchley Declaration. Under a potential Harris presidency, it is likely these efforts will continue.\n\nThe Trump administration oversaw a dramatic shift in diplomatic engagements with Beijing, Trump has made clear he remains firm in his opposition to China, and commentators at the Heritage Foundation have argued that working with China on AI empowers an adversary to the detriment of U.S. technological leadership. Given this criticism and U.S. conservatives' broader rhetorical tenor against China, it is hard to imagine track one diplomatic engagement continuing uninterrupted. It is even harder to imagine agreement between the United States and China on shared rules and principles governing advanced AI systems beyond areas where there is a clear mutual interest in avoiding inadvertent escalation.\n\nThe dual objectives of stifling China's tech industry and ensuring American leadership in the development of powerful AI systems reveal clear contradictions in Trump's broader tech agenda: antagonism toward China, an opportunistic policy shift on TikTok, and a disdain for Big Tech censorship accompanied by a cozy relationship with some parts of Silicon Valley. Many of the leading developers of frontier AI models today are the same companies that Trump believes have wronged him and that conservative lawmakers criticize for exerting too much power in digital markets and silencing conservative speech. Undercutting those companies may harm America's ability to guide the development of frontier models. How the Trump administration reconciles these competing priorities is anyone's guess, though several tech leaders are betting it will net out in their favor.\n\nThere are, however, several areas where we might instead expect continuity. Export controls on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment began under the Trump administration and accelerated under the Biden administration. There is some indication that Harris could continue this targeted approach in a new administration; however, she has been critical of Trump's tariffs in the past. Trump has said that he would impose a tariff of greater than 60% on Chinese goods, and a second Trump administration would likely take an even more aggressive posture on trade with China. As a result, this type of restriction is likely to continue or be tightened. Importantly, the implementation of the export control regime for semiconductors depends, in part, on compliance from allies -- in particular the Netherlands and Japan. Under a more transactional \"America First\" foreign policy, the Trump administration may struggle to maintain support from key partners who control vital chokepoints in the semiconductor supply chain. This could make it even more difficult to thwart China's AI and military progress.\n\nShould Trump win a second term in office, we are also likely to see a continued focus on extreme harms of AI safety (e.g., biotech), but less of a focus on AI's impact on civil rights. A key focus of the Biden administration's AI policy has been the impact of the technology on workers, marginalized communities, and other groups that are particularly vulnerable to disruption from transformative technologies. In her address ahead of the Bletchley Summit, Harris rejected a narrow focus on existential risk, remarking that harms to individual rights and well-being \"also feel existential\" to those they affect. Given the strong deregulatory bent of the first Trump administration and the Republican Party more broadly, coupled with Trump's hostility toward ideas like diversity, equity, and inclusion and \"wokeness,\" these challenges may be deprioritized as part of a second Trump administration's AI policy.\n\nThere does seem to be general convergence around AI safety and the potential catastrophic risks from frontier AI systems as important policy issues. Trump himself has called AI a \"superpower\" that is \"very disconcerting\" and even opponents of Biden's EO have recognized the need for guardrails. Though there is widespread opposition among Republican leaders to perceived executive overreach by the Biden administration, the earlier voluntary commitments could be the type of nonbinding, self-governance measures that a deregulatory second Trump administration might favor.", "source": {"uri": "brookings.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brookings"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Information security leaders can leverage specialized AI capabilities to defend against AI-driven attacks, secure employee usage of AI, and protect their AI applications.\n\nThe already heavy burden born by enterprise security leaders is being dramatically worsened by AI, machine learning, and generative AI (genAI). Malware, phishing, and ransomware are fast-growing threats given new potency and effectiveness with AI - for example, improving phishing attacks, creating convincing fake identities or impersonating real ones.\n\nEasy access to online genAI platforms, such as ChatGPT, lets employees carelessly or inadvertently upload sensitive or confidential data. In the hands of adversaries, AI exploits two attack vectors:\n\nOrganizations are reacting to the rise of AI in one of two ways:\n\nInformation security leaders need an approach that is comprehensive, flexible and realistic.\n\nLeveraging AI to counter AI\n\nSecurity leaders are already grappling with how to use AI to defend against such attacks, to monitor employee usage of it, and protect the organization's applications, including AI apps and models. Adopting still more, individual security tools, now with AI incorporated, is already happening.\n\nBut such an ad hoc approach carries trade-offs: integration is minimal or absent entirely; centralized management is nearly impossible; data sharing is difficult; and the workload on security staff is rising.\n\nAn alternative approach: AI-based security platforms\n\nA better option is connected cybersecurity platforms, each with AI capabilities designed and trained to address a broad security function, such as code protection, employee usage, and security operations (SecOps). Where needed, these platforms can be augmented by specialized security tools targeting specific vulnerabilities.\n\nIdeally, these AI-powered security platforms are designed to work in harmony with each other, enabling central management and shared data, and - through open APIs - with at least some existing security tools. This consolidation approach can be thought of as the \"platformization\" of enterprise cybersecurity in the AI era. It transcends the stale \"best-of-breed versus one-size-fits-all\" debate.\n\nEnterprise security leaders can start by focusing on a few key priorities.\n\nDefend against AI-driven attacks: Block sophisticated web-based threats, zero-day threats, evasive command-and-control attacks, and DNS hijacking attacks.\n\nSecure employee AI usage: Classify and prioritize genAI apps to assess risk and detect anomalies; create and enforce very specific usage policies; and alert and coach employees on using AI safely.\n\nSecure AI development: Monitor real-time AI traffic flows covering applications, models, user access and infrastructure threats; and enable anomaly detection to protect AI models from manipulation.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAI gives your adversaries unprecedented power. Leveraging AI in connected cybersecurity platforms gives you the same power to defend against AI-driven attacks, secure employee usage of AI, and protect your AI software supply chain.\n\nLeverage a platform approach to fight AI-based cyber threats with AI-based capabilities.

Similarly, Amazon has announced that it will terminate hundreds of jobs in sectors requiring physical labor to maximize efficiency from AI-focused processes.\n\nDigital media company BuzzFeed revealed that it laid off 12% of its workforce last December and an additional 15% in April. The company also plans to shut down its news unit, BuzzFeed News.\n\nWalt Disney, one of the largest companies in the US entertainment industry, has announced plans to lay off 7,000 employees and eliminate $5.5 billion in costs.\n\nIn response to AI's negative impacts on employment, some governments are taking steps to mitigate these effects. The EU recently launched the Digital Europe Program, aimed at investing in digital skills training and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in adapting to digital transformation.\n\n'AI will be transformative for many professions'\n\nUgur Karaboga, managing Partner at T\u00fcrkiye's job search and career development platform Yenibiris, said generative AI applications \"will automate routine and repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency while still necessitating human labor.\"\n\n\"While efficiency in routine tasks will increase, we cannot ignore the need for human power to use this technology and the fact that there are human elements in some service areas that machines cannot perform,\" Karaboga told Anadolu, emphasizing the need for both employers and employees to be prepared for this transformative process.\n\nRegardless of the processes and development of AI, it will always be necessary to offer personalized services, understand customer needs, and manage complex situations, he said.\n\n\"The important thing is how we adapt to this process.\"\n\nAI has been affecting various sectors differently, Karaboga said, highlighting significant progress in automation of routine tasks in production and logistics services.\n\nHowever, he believes that both sides of the workforce must make significant efforts to keep up with changes and stay competitive.\n\n\"What does this effort entail? Of course, it involves diversifying education and development opportunities to attract and retain the right talents. Talent shortages are a major issue in the new world. With access to talent becoming more challenging, we must successfully incorporate highly skilled young people from different fields into the workforce. We need to engage with them frequently and understand their expectations from the business world,\" Karaboga said.\n\nHe added that AI will transform many professions, with data mining being one of the foremost fields.\n\n'Generative AI will affect mental labor experts more'\n\nFatih Uysal, CEO of Kariyer.net, another Turkish online job search and career development platform, shared the results of an analysis conducted by the company on the changes and transformations in the employment market.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the demand for AI-related positions by employers increased by 81%, while the supply for these roles rose by 11%.\n\nUysal said that these results indicate a growing need for candidates with AI skills in the future, with some professions requiring new skills and others disappearing entirely.\n\nHe pointed out that the technology, media, and digital industries will be the most affected by automation and AI developments in the global labor market.\n\n\"Previously, AI was thought to develop automation mainly in blue-collar positions. However, today, it is said that generative AI will affect mental labor experts more,\" he said.\n\nReferring to a report by global management consulting firm McKinsey, he said that jobs requiring a high level of education have the highest potential for automation with generative AI.\n\nAccording to the report, while 54% of jobs requiring a high school diploma or less can be automated without generative AI, this rate jumps to 63% with generative AI.\n\nFor master's and doctoral-level jobs, this rate rises from 28% to 57%.\n\n\"Therefore, highly educated candidates will need to develop their AI skills in the coming period,\" Uysal said.\n\nUysal highlighted that as AI technologies advance, new career opportunities will arise.\n\n\"As generative AI integrates and develops within business processes, existing jobs are transforming, and new job fields are emerging. It is possible to see positions like Prompt Engineering, Data Labeling, Data Cleaning, AI Legal Compliance Specialist, AI Trainer, AI-Supported Solution Experts in Health and Customer Relations, and many bot/assistant services emerging,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-collar_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blue-collar worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_consulting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Management consulting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/07/25/thumbs_b_c_588d9be302865641adb59211e3298689.jpg?v=183308", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The study, conducted by policy consultancy Public First, found that 61% of all UK jobs could be significantly improved by AI, while 31% are likely to remain largely unaffected by the technology's advancements.\n\nEvery work sector will be impacted in some way by AI, with office and administrative roles most likely to see changes, while jobs in social care, transportation, accommodation and food services are expected to be the least affected. Previous research by Google and Public First suggested that AI could generate more than \u00a3400billion for the UK economy by 2030.\n\nTo help workers adapt, Google is launching its AI Works schemes to explore ways to improve AI skills, address trust issues, and identify the best methods for teaching AI-based skills. The firm has collaborated with the Community Union trade group, Enterprise Nation's small business community including Grind Coffee, and educational bodies such as Academies Enterprise Trust and Leo Academy Trust.\n\nDebbie Weinstein, managing director for Google UK and Ireland, spoke about the potential to utilise AI skills to boost careers and grow businesses in Britain: \"The country faces a once-in-a-generation opportunity to empower British workers, by equipping them with future-focused AI skills to help develop their careers and grow UK businesses.\"\n\nShe stressed the importance of partnership in tackling the challenge: \"We know one company alone can't meet these challenges, that's why we're excited to be working with these partners to uncover insights we can all learn from.\"\n\nHighlighting the transformative possibility of AI, she remarked: \"If we get this right, AI has the potential to transform working life as we know it, while helping boost UK productivity.\"\n\nShe responded to concerns about AI replacing human jobs, suggesting the new study could be reassuring: \"I certainly hope so. I think what's interesting about this is it suggests that the bulk of jobs, 99%, are going to use AI as a compliment or augmentation to the things that humans are doing every single day.\"\n\nShe expressed optimism in integrating AI into work life for increased productivity and satisfaction: \"I think the sooner that we can get people on board with 'how can this augment my job to help me be more productive and help me have a more fulfilling work life?

This also enables more sophisticated career forecasting and pathway planning, helping individuals make informed decisions about their professional trajectories by matching them with best-fit mentors. In conjunction, AI systems use predictive analytics to forecast industry trends, job market demands, and potential career trajectories. For instance, IBM's Watson Career Coach uses AI to help employees identify potential career paths and the skills needed to achieve them. This then facilitates optimized networking opportunities and recommended people for career connections.\n\nAI tools can analyze current job roles and identify emerging skills gaps. Platforms like Gloat and Eightfold.ai provide insights into evolving industry requirements, guiding professionals to acquire skills that keep them competitive and relevant. Recognizing these skills gaps allows people to select appropriate training to bridge the gap and accelerate their career progress. In conjunction, companies are identifying skill needs within their companies and offering training to improve their job candidate pool. For instance, Google offers AI-designed career certificates that help learners gain job-ready skills in high-demand fields like data analytics, project management, and UX design. These programs use AI to update content regularly, ensuring that learners acquire the most current and market-relevant skills. Likewise, IBM's Watson Career Coach is an AI platform that assists employees in navigating their career paths within an organization. It provides personalized advice and insights, helping users understand where their skills are most needed and how they can grow within the company.\n\nWhile AI offers numerous benefits in career development, it also presents ethical considerations and challenges that need addressing. First and foremost is data privacy and security. The use of AI in career development often involves processing large amounts of personal data. Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is crucial, requiring robust data protection measures and clear user consent protocols. Second is bias and fairness. AI algorithms can perpetuate biases if not carefully designed and monitored. Already, companies like Amazon have inadvertently perpetuated stereotypes in their hiring process. Ensuring AI systems in career development are fair and unbiased is essential to prevent discrimination and ensure equal opportunities for all users. Third, enterprises need to determine the best balance between AI and human judgment. While AI can provide valuable insights and recommendations, it's important to balance these with human judgment and personal intuition. Career decisions should be informed by AI but ultimately driven by individual aspirations and values.\n\nLooking ahead, the role of AI in career development is set to expand, offering even more personalized and sophisticated assistance. Already, there is explosive growth in tools for continuous learning and upskilling. As job roles evolve, continuous learning and upskilling become crucial. AI will play a key role in identifying emerging skills and providing tailored learning opportunities, ensuring professionals remain adaptable and competitive. In addition, enterprises will continue their rapid integration of AI with human resources. This will optimize and increase human resource management systems to supercharge talent development, succession planning, and workforce optimization. Moreover, this integration will help align individual career goals with organizational needs. Finally, AI is expanding access to job opportunities. AI has the potential to democratize access to career opportunities, breaking down geographical and socioeconomic barriers. By providing personalized learning and job recommendations, AI can help individuals from diverse backgrounds access the resources and opportunities they need to succeed.\n\nUltimately, AI is a powerful ally in navigating the complexities of modern career development. It offers personalized learning, efficient job searching, insightful career forecasting, and much more. However, harnessing AI's potential in career development requires a careful balance of technological innovation, ethical considerations, and personal judgment. As we embrace AI in our professional journeys, it's important to remain cognizant of its limitations and biases, ensuring that our career decisions are not only data-driven but also align with our personal aspirations and values. In the ever-changing landscape of work, AI stands as a dynamic tool, guiding us towards fulfilling and successful careers.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_profile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "User profile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coursera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personalized learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udemy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Udemy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equal opportunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career_and_Job_Advancement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Career and Job Advancement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6676327de6f14acdb8a6a02d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

From Google's cloud boom and ServiceNow's leadership shakeup to Pearl's dental AI breakthrough, the industry is witnessing unprecedented growth and transformation, but the cost of innovation and the need for careful navigation are becoming increasingly apparent.\n\nGoogle's parent Alphabet is riding high on the AI wave, with its cloud business crossing the $10 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time. But as the tech giant pours resources into the AI arms race, investors are keeping a wary eye on mounting costs.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Alphabet showcased the fruits of its AI push. Google Cloud revenue jumped 29% year over year to $10.3 billion, propelled by demand for AI and data analytics tools. The division also turned a $1.1 billion profit, a stark turnaround from its money-losing past.\n\n\"We are innovating at every layer of the AI stack,\" CEO Sundar Pichai told investors, touting the company's \"longstanding infrastructure leadership and in-house research teams.\"\n\nBut AI doesn't come cheap. Alphabet's research and development costs swelled to $11.9 billion, up 12% from a year earlier. The company also shuffled its AI teams, consolidating model development under Google DeepMind to \"accelerate progress.\"\n\nWhile overall revenue climbed 14% to $84.7 billion, beating analyst estimates, the cost of that growth is under scrutiny. Alphabet's CFO and newly minted president Ruth Porat emphasized efforts to \"durably re-engineer our cost base\" even as the company invests in AI.\n\nThe balancing act reflects a broader trend in Big Tech, as companies funnel billions into AI infrastructure and talent while facing pressure to maintain profit margins.\n\nFor now, Google's core search business continues to foot the AI bill, with ad revenue up 11% to $64.6 billion. However, as the AI landscape evolves rapidly, the tech giant must prove it can translate its massive investments into sustainable growth and market leadership.\n\nServiceNow is surfing the AI tsunami, but choppy waters lie ahead for the software giant's leadership team.\n\nThe company's second-quarter earnings report, released Wednesday (July 24), painted a rosy picture of AI-fueled growth. Subscription revenues soared 23% year-over-year to $2.54 billion, while the company inked 88 deals worth over $1 million each -- a 26% jump from last year.\n\nAt the heart of this surge is ServiceNow's AI offering, Now Assist. The generative AI tool saw its new annual contract value double from the previous quarter, including 11 deals exceeding $1 million. CEO Bill McDermott noted the company's intention to \"reinvent every workflow, in every company, in every industry with GenAI at the core.\"\n\nBut the AI celebration was overshadowed by a leadership earthquake. CJ Desai, president and chief operating officer, abruptly departed following an internal investigation. The probe, which also involved government entities, centered on the hiring of a former U.S. Army chief information officer for a public sector role.\n\n\"We believe this was an isolated incident,\" the company said, but the fallout has prompted a reshuffle. Chris Bedi, a ServiceNow veteran, steps in as interim chief product officer.\n\nDespite the executive turbulence, ServiceNow is doubling down on its AI bet. The company launched its RaptorDB Lighthouse program to help customers harness massive datasets for AI applications. It also acquired Raytion, a German firm specializing in information retrieval, to boost its AI-powered search capabilities.\n\nAt your next dental checkup, the tool detecting cavities might not be the sharp explorer in your dentist's hand but a silent algorithm analyzing your X-rays.\n\nPearl, a dental AI company, has just secured a $58 million Series B funding to expand its suite of AI tools. The firm, which cut its teeth on AI-assisted X-ray analysis, plans to use this capital infusion to drill down on advanced computer vision and new AI applications in treatment planning, insurance claims and dental education.\n\nThe funding comes as Pearl's AI software gains traction globally with regulatory approvals in 120 countries. The technology aims to address inconsistencies in diagnostic accuracy, a challenge in dentistry affecting patient care quality.\n\n\"Dentistry has become an AI standard-bearer in healthcare,\" Ophir Tanz, Pearl's founder and CEO, said in a news release. \"This historic funding round underscores the impact of Pearl's capabilities.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence arms race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Porat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Porat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ServiceNow", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ServiceNow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_product_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief product officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McDermott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill McDermott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Google-Cloud-AI-investments.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 2266, "textEnd": 2273}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Otherwise, AI could bring more harm than good to our lives.\"\n\n\"This commonsense bill will allow for a voluntary set of guidelines for AI, which will only help the development of systems that choose to adopt them. I look forward to getting this bill and our AI Research Innovation and Accountability Act passed out of the Commerce Committee soon,\" said Capito.\n\nCurrently, AI companies make claims about how they train, conduct safety red-team exercises, and carry out risk management on their AI models without any external verification. The VET AI Act would create a pathway for independent evaluators, with a function similar to those in the financial industry and other sectors, to work with companies as a neutral third-party to verify their development, testing, and use of AI is in compliance with established guardrails. As Congress moves to establish AI regulations, evidence-based benchmarks to independently validate AI companies' claims on safety testing will only become more essential.\n\nEarlier this month, Hickenlooper announced his intent to introduce the VET AI Act. For full bill text, click HERE.\n\nIn a February speech at Silicon Flatirons, Hickenlooper proposed his \"Trust, but Verify Framework\", which included a call to establish auditing standards for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in order to increase transparency and adoption of AI while protecting consumers. In the same speech, Hickenlooper also called for federal data privacy legislation to create a national standard for protecting Americans' personal and sensitive data.\n\nSpecifically, the VET AI Act would:\n\nDirect NIST, in coordination with the Department of Energy and National Science Foundation, to develop voluntary specifications and guidelines for developers and deployers of AI systems to conduct internal assurance and work with third parties on external assurance regarding the verification and red-teaming of AI systems.\n\nSuch specifications require considerations for data privacy protections, mitigations against potential harms to individuals from an AI system, dataset quality, and governance and communications processes of a developer or deployer throughout the AI systems' development lifecycles.\n\nEstablish a collaborative Advisory Committee to review and recommend criteria for individuals or organizations seeking to obtain certification of their ability to conduct internal or external assurance for AI systems.\n\nRequire NIST to conduct a study examining various aspects of the ecosystem of AI assurance, including the current capabilities and methodologies used, facilities or resources needed, and overall market demand for internal and external AI assurance.\n\n\"Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) Action applauds Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) for their leadership on the VET Artificial Intelligence Act to both spur AI development and deployment, while also protecting Americans from privacy harms. Its commonsense public-private sector approach will help grow consumer trust in AI, expanding the number of Americans and businesses adopting this important set of technologies. At a time when AI is being used by vast numbers of Americans in nearly every sector of our economy, we're excited to see Sens. Hickenlooper and Moore Capito work together to craft this thoughtful bill,\" said Michele Stockwell, President, BPC Action\n\n\"The Validation and Evaluation for Trustworthy (VET) AI Act would bring much-needed certainty to AI developers, deployers, and third parties on external assurances on what processes such as verification, red teaming, and compliance should look like while we, as a country, figure out how we will engage with AI governance and regulation,\" says Dan Correa, Chief Executive Officer of the Federation of American Scientists. \"We commend Senator Hickenlooper and Senator Capito for working together on this global policy issue that will showcase America's leadership in setting standards for AI Safety and Governance. This bill also highlights the importance of NIST in paving the way for innovative and equitable uses of AI, underscoring that this critical agency should have enough resources to lead the way in AI standards-setting.\"\n\n\"The Center for AI Policy (CAIP) strongly endorses the Validation and Evaluation for Trustworthy (VET) AI Act, spearheaded by Senator Hickenlooper and Senator Capito. This bipartisan legislation represents a crucial step towards ensuring AI safety through collaborative efforts across industry, academia, and government. Although many AI companies now make at least some effort to evaluate their models, there is no way for outsiders to tell whether the evaluation is complete, accurate, and performed with integrity. The VET AI Act would solve this problem by developing reliable third-party standards for evaluating whether an AI model can be trusted to behave as intended. CAIP is encouraged to see legislators making important progress toward this worthy goal,\" said Jason Green-Lowe, Executive Director for the Center for AI Policy\n\n\"Developing voluntary best practices for rigorously assessing the safety and reliability of AI systems will help ensure their responsible deployment. The VET AI Act would accelerate efforts to create a standardized methodology for evaluating AI systems and equip U.S. companies with new tools to ensure their AI systems are among the most trusted in the global market,\" said Daniel Castro, Vice President of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation\n\n\"The public is increasingly at a loss as to who or what to trust when it comes to AI systems and the Validation and Evaluation for Trustworthy (VET) AI Act is a necessary and significant step towards addressing that gap between public apprehension and trust. IEEE-USA is thankful that Senator Hickenlooper has introduced legislation to ensure that AI systems are demonstrably trustworthy, fair, and equitable,\" said David Mindham, Vice President of IEEE-USA.\n\n\"OTI welcomes the introduction of the VET AI Act. This piece of legislation is a necessary step in building out a meaningful regulatory environment, as it sets a rigorous bar for both internal and third-party specifications and auditing. It's important to center concerns around data privacy and protection, mitigating harms that can stem from AI use, and the existence of processes for governance and communication within the development and deployment of AI. The bill does just that. The VET AI Act's focus on aligning US practices with international standards on assurance is an important component that ensures the United States harmonizes its approach to AI governance, which will make it easier for AI companies to be globally compliant and competitive,\" said Prem Trivedi, Policy Director at OTI\n\n\"Booz Allen is proud to support the 'Validation and Evaluation for Trustworthy (VET) Artificial Intelligence Act'. We believe that the Act's emphasis on testing, evaluation, validation, and verification of AI systems aligns with our goals for building public trust and accountability in AI applications. The bill's emphasis on 'consensus-driven and evidence-based guidelines' resonates with our belief that a one-size-fits-all approach is impractical for AI systems. The focus on 'use case' and 'relative risk' is commendable, as it aligns with our support for context-driven, risk-based AI governance, and it mirrors our principles for delivering trusted AI, promising a future of responsible AI technology growth and governance,\"said John Larson, Executive Vice President, Head of Booz Allen's AI Business\n\n\"The VET AI Act represents an important step in promoting effective and consistent assurance safeguards over AI technologies. As the association representing professionals responsible for providing independent internal assurance - especially as it relates to AI - The IIA supports the legislation's emphasis on establishing essential governance and risk management processes. The IIA was grateful for the opportunity to work with Senator Hickenlooper's staff and provide legislative language that was included in the VET AI Act. We believe these changes will enhance the already strong foundation of the VET AI Act. We look forward to a continued dialogue with Senator Hickenlooper and other congressional leaders as this critical legislation advances,\" said Anthony J. Pugliese CIA, CPA, CGMA, CITP President and Chief Executive Officer of The Institute of Internal Auditors\n\n\"The Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) is pleased to express support for the Validation and Evaluation for Trustworthy (VET) AI Act co-sponsored by U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper (D-CO) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). Introduction of this legislation is an important step towards advancing the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies and supporting U.S. innovation and leadership in AI. As the pace of AI advancement continues to accelerate, pragmatic guardrails are important to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing potential risks. The VET AI Act contributes to this through its directive for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to collaborate with federal agencies, industry stakeholders, academia, and civil society to develop detailed specifications, guidelines, and recommendations for third-party evaluators. These standards would factor in privacy protections, harm mitigation, dataset quality, and governance throughout the AI development lifecycle which is essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. By establishing a collaborative Advisory Committee and mandating a comprehensive study on the AI assurance ecosystem, the VET AI Act ensures a well-rounded and informed approach to AI regulation and certification. SIIA looks forward to working with Congress towards passage of this critical bill.\" said Paul Lekas, Head of Global Public Policy & Government Affairs and Senior Vice President of SIIA\n\n\"The introduction of the VET AI Act represents a major step forward in establishing a framework for responsible AI development and deployment and we applaud Senators Hickenlooper and Capito for their leadership on this critical issue. The proposed legislation addresses one of the most pressing challenges in AI governance: the need for independent verification of AI companies' claims about their systems' safety, reliability, and compliance with ethical standards. The VET AI Act's focus on developing specifications and guidelines for third-party evaluators is a thoughtful approach to increasing transparency and accountability in the AI industry. By involving NIST, federal agencies, and stakeholders from industry, academia, and civil society, the bill ensures a comprehensive and collaborative process in creating these standards. At Americans for Responsible Innovation, we believe that as AI capabilities continue to advance, it is essential that we develop robust mechanisms to verify companies' claims about their AI models' safety and risk management practices. Public trust and verifiable safety are essential to the widespread adoption of beneficial AI. We are particularly encouraged by the bill's emphasis on data privacy protections, mitigations against potential harms, dataset quality, and governance processes throughout AI systems' development lifecycles. These considerations are fundamental to ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in a responsible manner,\"said Eric Gastfriend, Executive Director of Americans for Responsible Innovation.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher",

Even the most affected sector, financial and insurance, is forecast to lose just 4% of jobs, with 83% \"enhanced\" instead.\n\nPublic First's findings are similar to recent research from the Tony Blair Institute. The thinktank drew up its estimates by using an AI model \"to classify over 17,000 types of work tasks by the potential for generative AI to either significantly reduce the time taken to do them, or automate them entirely\".\n\nGiven the research, Google is partnering with the Community union, the small-business network Enterprise Nation, and a pair of multi-academy trusts to try to crack how best to introduce AI technology into typical workplaces in a way that boosts workers' abilities rather than replaces them.\n\nWeinstein said: \"Part of what's tricky about us talking about it now is that we actually don't know exactly what's going to transpire. What we do know is the first step is going to be sitting down [with the partners] and really understanding the use cases. If it's school administrators versus people in the classroom, what are the particular tasks we actually want to get after for these folks?\n\n\"If you are a school teacher some of it might be a simple email with ideas about how to use Gemini in lesson planning, some of it might be formal classroom training, some of it one on one coaching. Across 1,200 people there will be a lot of different pilots, each group with around 100 people.\"\n\nThe government backs the trial, with Minister for AI, Feryal Clark MP, saying: \"Speeding up the diffusion of AI throughout our economy will be key to kickstarting growth, transforming our public services, and delivering new opportunities for working people across the country. Just as important, is making sure we bring people along with us and build a workforce which is fit for the future by delivering the AI skills training which will help careers to flourish and businesses to grow - this will help us do just that.\"\n\nPublic First estimates potential gains of more than \u00a3400bn for the UK economy if AI were adopted to its fullest over the next six years, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 2.6% from the technology alone.\n\nIt says that 100 hours a year could be saved by the average British worker using generative AI, a gain which, Google claims, is the biggest improvement to worker productivity \"since the arrival of Google Search\".\n\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, on Tuesday reported surging profits and revenues, as well as a $70bn stock buyback. Its AI exploits this year came under scrutiny when it botched the rollout of its Gemini AI image-generator tool, which led to investor fears about its investments in artificial intelligence products.\n\nHowever, it doubled down on showcasing its investments in AI during its annual developers' conference in May. Among the AI-related features and tools it debuted was an attempt to overhaul Google Search through the widespread release of AI Overviews, short pieces of text that summarise articles and search results.

Some chatbots were hopelessly behind in the news, even claiming that the attempted assassination was \"misinformation\" and refusing to answer questions about who was running for president, according to the Washington Post.\n\nSome bots fared better than others, namely Microsoft's Copilot, which includes plentiful links to news sources. But it reveals the dangers in trusting AI as a search engine, especially for breaking news.\n\nWhile this particular use case is lagging behind, others are zooming ahead with tons of new features and technological advancements. Adobe is more deeply integrating AI tools into its classic suite of Photoshop and Illustrator, allowing users to create images, textures and other assets using text prompts, TechCrunch reports. While this could help experienced designers save time, it also raises the fear of those same experienced designers being replaced by fast, low-cost AI solutions. Designers also have concerns over how their intellectual property could be used to feed AI models.\n\nSamsung also released a new sketch-to-image tool that allows you to draw a doodle that can then be illustrated using generative AI. This can be fun when it's just a sketch, but it can warp reality in some worrying ways when you can add an AI-generated element to an existing photo.\n\nYou'll only hear more about these weighty issues in the coming weeks and months.\n\nLLM laggard Apple is finally working on its own tool, the rolls-off-the-tongue DCLM-Baseline-7B. That 7B stands for \"7 billion,\" or how many parameters it was trained on. ZDNet reports that it performs competitively against other models and is truly open source, allowing other organizations to build on Apple's work.\n\nWe'll have to see exactly how Apple integrates this model into other projects.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta has its sights set on the AI throne currently occupied by OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company recently released Llama version 3.1, the newest version of its open-source tool. The company claims that the new version outperforms major competitors like ChatGPT and Claude by several metrics. Meta, which has heavily incorporated the tool into its social platform like Facebook and Instagram, predicts that it will become the most-used AI platform in the world. Given Meta's reach, that would make sense. But the question is, what is the demand for generative AI and search as part of a social platform?\n\nRisks\n\nIn news, that's equal parts depressing and unsurprising, deepfakes of Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris began to re-circulate quickly after she stepped into her new role.\n\nThe video combines real footage of Harris giving a speech at Howard University with manipulated audio intended to make her sound as if she is slurring her words and speaking in nonsensical circles, Mashable reported.\n\nTikTok pulled the video down, but not before it racked up more than 4 million views. X, which has no prohibition against misinformation and deepfakes, allowed the video to remain up, albeit with a Community Note that identifies it for what it is. It's a reminder of the power of lies to spread around the world before the truth gets its pants on, as well as the brand dangers inherent on X.\n\nBut the AI industry is exposing others to risks as well through unvetted use of data. Figma's \"Make Designs\" tool had to be pulled from the market after users asked it create a weather app and discovered it spit out an example eerily similar to Apple's iconic Weather app.\n\nIf a user were to take that app to market, they could wind up in serious legal trouble.\n\nFigma acknowledges that some designs the tool was trained on weren't vetted carefully enough. That's cold comfort to companies who might rely on generative AI to provide designs and data they can trust.\n\nRelatedly, AI chatbot Perplexity is being accused of plagiarism by Cond\u00e9 Nast, claiming that the tool is using the magazine company's reporting without permission or credit. While there's just a cease-and-desist letter at this stage, it's safe to guess that a lawsuit may soon follow.\n\nIn response to that deluge of lawsuits, many generative AI companies are working carefully to provide the vetted, trustworthy, approved content that businesses demand. Some, like Getty, are paying real human photographers to take pictures that can feed their AI models and ensure that every bit of information in the model is on the up-and-up.\n\nThat, in turn, puts AI companies without those same resources in a bind when it comes time to train their models. According to researchers from the Data Provenance Initiative, 5% of all data and 25% of high-quality data has been restricted from use in AI models. As LLMs require a steady stream of data to stay up-to-date, this will pose new challenges for AI companies, forcing them to pay, adapt or die.\n\nBut even paying can cause controversy. A group of academics were outraged to discover their content had been sold by their publisher without their permission to Microsoft for use in AI. They were neither asked nor informed about the deal, according to reports. The importance of communicating how data will be used to all parties involved will only become more vital.\n\nInvestors are beginning to suspect we're in an AI bubble as big tech companies pour more and more cash into AI investments that have yet to pay off and startups proliferate and earn tons of funding.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean AI will disappear or cease to be a hot technology any more than the internet disappeared during the dot-com bubble. But it does mean that the easy days of slapping \"AI\" onto a product or company name and raking in the dough may be coming to an end, even as many of us still strive to figure out how to incorporate these tools in our day-to-day workflow.\n\nRegulation\n\nCoverage of Kamala Harris' campaign launch is awash with information on of she stands on the issues that matter to American voters. Of course, that includes AI regulation.\n\nTechCrunch highlights Harris' roots as San Francisco's district attorney and California's attorney general before becoming a senator in 2016.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch:\n\nSome of the industry's critics have complained that she didn't do enough as attorney general to curb the power of tech giants as they grew.\n\nAt the same time, she has been willing to criticize tech CEOs and call for more regulation. As a senator, she pressed the big social networks over misinformation. During the 2020 presidential campaign, when rival Elizabeth Warren was calling for the breakup of big tech, Harris was asked whether companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook should be broken up. She instead said they should be \"regulated in a way that we can ensure the American consumer can be certain that their privacy is not being compromised.\"\n\nAs vice president, Harris has also spoken about the potential for regulating AI, saying that she and President Biden \"reject the false choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.\"\n\nFive senators sent a letter to OpenAI on Monday asking for context around its safety and employment practices following a group whistleblower complaint that alleged the company prevented staff from warning regulators about the risks its AI advancements posed.\n\nThe Hill reports:\n\nLed by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), the group of mostly Democratic senators asked OpenAI CEO Sam Altman about the AI startup's public commitments to safety, as well as its treatment of current and former employees who voice concerns.\n\n\"Given OpenAI's position as a leading AI company, it is important that the public can trust in the safety and security of its systems,\" Schatz, alongside Sens. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Angus King (I-Maine), wrote in Monday's letter.\n\n\"This includes the integrity of the company's governance structure and safety testing, its employment practices, its fidelity to its public promises and mission, and its cybersecurity policies,\" they continued.\n\nLast week, OpenAIjoined several tech companies including Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and others to form the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI), which will aim to \"address a 'fragmented landscape of AI security' by providing access to open-source methodologies, frameworks, and tools,\" according to Verge.\n\nFunctioning within the nonprofit Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), CoSAI will focus on three goals: Developing AI security best practices, addressing the challenges of AI and securing AI applications. The details still seem a little vague.\n\nIt's worth noting that CoSAI's aims fail to address calls for federal regulation in lieu of a formalized working group, and lawmakers will be watching to see what specific best practices the group comes up with.\n\nThis shouldn't suggest that some CoSAI members aren't advocating for regulation, too. Earlier this week, Amazon SVP of Global Public Policy and General Counsel David Zapolsky posted an article on the company's website advocating for global regulation - framing the need as a matter of economic prosperity and security.\n\n\"It's now very clear we can have rules that protect against risks, while also ensuring we don't hinder innovation,\" Zapolsky wrote. \"But we still need to secure global alignment on responsible AI measures to protect U.S. economic prosperity and security.\"\n\nZapolsky's suggestions include:\n\nWhile aspects of Zapolosky's letter read as a promotional recap of Amazon's progress in the space, showing the company's work and using that work as a catalyst for a larger conversation about regulation may be what bridges the current disconnect between big tech companies who think they can solve it themselves and a federal government that seems unable to move at the rapid pace of AI acceleration.\n\nMIT Technology Review Senior Reporter Melissa Heikkil\u00e4 reported that one year ago, on July 21, 2023, seven leading AI companies including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI committed to developing eight voluntary commitments for developing safe and responsible AI.\n\nOn the anniversary of that commitment, Heikkil\u00e4 asked the companies for details on their progress and asked experts to weigh in:\n\nTheir replies show that the tech sector has made some welcome progress, with big caveats.\n\n\"One year on, we see some good practices towards their own products, but [they're] nowhere near where we need them to be in terms of good governance or protection of rights at large,\" says Merve Hickok, the president and research director of the Center for AI and Digital Policy, who reviewed the companies' replies as requested by MIT Technology Review. Many of these companies continue to push unsubstantiated claims about their products, such as saying that they can supersede human intelligence and capabilities, adds Hickok.\n\nBut it's not clear what the commitments have changed and whether the companies would have implemented these measures anyway, says Rishi Bommasani, the society lead at the Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models, who also reviewed the responses for MIT Technology Review.\n\nIt's no surprise that formal regulations continue to stall. As previously reported, AI lobbying has surged drastically YOY and leading tech companies have demonstrated their vested interest in proposing their own safeguards for responsible AI over helping Uncle Sam standardize something that will hold them accountable.\n\nAmazon's letter is a notable exception that stands out as an example of how an organization's thought leaders can highlight the work and advancements as a conversation starter..\n\nThe regulation conversation continues to prove fascinating, even as it moves slowly. With headlines continuing to focus on the November elections, it will be worth watching to see what progress makes on the way out and what tangible policy Harris is willing to shape.\n\nAI at work\n\nAs federal AI regulation continues to move at a sluggish pace, most businesses are also still in the early stages of adoptingAI.\n\nAxios shared the results of AI platform ServiceNow's inaugural AI Maturity Index, which surveyed nearly 4,500 respondents across 21 countries, and found that \"many companies have struggled to go from experiments into full-scale use of the technology.\"\n\n\"The study assigned maturity scores between 1 and 100,\" reported Axios. \" The average score was 44 and the highest score was just 71. Only about 1 in 6 companies scored higher than 50.\"\n\nServiceNow Chief Customer Office Chris Bedi told Axios that the adoption of AI use cases is ultimately a leadership competency.\n\n\"You have to be able to get up in front of your team and say, 'Here's how your roles are going to evolve in an AI-first world,'\" he said.\n\nBedi also broke the maturity curve for adoption into two modes, defining the first mode around incremental improvements and the second mode as taking the leap to design new models and augment ways of working.\n\n\"Mode two is harder,\" continued Bedi. \"It's saying, 'If we were to assume the models are good enough, and AI was pervasive, how would we redesign these departments, these jobs, the organization, the enterprise, from scratch?' It's a much harder intellectual exercise.\"\n\nThough much of the piece reads as promotional, it highlights the wisdom and innovation of those at the frontline of AI advancements to drive forward the maturity Bedi advocates for. This will require a partnership between those doing the work and the leaders who ultimately sign off on the budget to be advocates.\n\nWhile many organizations are slow to move to this second mode, former Amazon AI engineer Ashish Nagar recently explained how he created the customer service intelligence platform Level AI to address productivity challenges in the automated customer service industry:\n\n\"Frontline workers, like customer service workers, are the biggest human capital in the world,\" Nagar told TechCrunch. \"So, my idea was to use ambient computing -- AI that you can just talk to and it listens in the background -- to augment human work.\"\n\nWhile the TechCrunch piece and the Axios report both hinge on the expertise of a service provider, Forbes contributor Bernard Marr asks what promised innovations will really prove transformative across industries and which are exercises in marketing:\n\nWhile the picture being painted points to an imminent revolution across all industries, in reality, the impact is likely to be more iterative and nuanced.\n\nPredictions of astronomic leaps in value that AI will add to industries may be achievable in theory. But challenges around regulation and data privacy, as well as technical challenges such as overcoming AI hallucination and bias, may not be simple to solve.\n\nOverall, this means that while I believe AI will have truly profound implications for business, jobs and industry, the pace of this transformation may well be slower than some of the hype and hyperbole suggests - in the short term, at least.\n\nMarr's piece, which homes in on the gap between aspirational promises and execution of AI solutions across the retail and financial services industries, offers a sobering reminder to communicators: Being an advocate and early adopter of new tech requires cutting through the advertorial language, asking for metrics and examples from solutions providers, and setting aside time to experiment on the frontend.\n\nThis remains one of the best ways to ensure that your skills as a communicator are central to the strategic growth and scale of your operations-ensuring that any tools you advocate for have been tested to ensure they prioritize safety, accuracy and tangible results.\n\nWhat trends and news are you tracking in the AI space?

Advanced AI algorithms are employed to analyse massive datasets, enabling predictive maintenance of energy infrastructure, optimising power grid operations, dispatch of production, consumption and storage assets, in addition to identifying opportunities for energy savings.\n\nThere are many AI use cases across the entire energy value chain from time series forecasting, market analysis, optimised bid selection, anomaly detection, failure prevention and consumption pattern recognitions. AI technology plays a crucial role in minimising greenhouse gas emissions and addressing climate change. Systems powered by AI can pinpoint the most effective approaches for utilising captured carbon, model and predict climate change and weather patterns, and help design greener smarter cities and more energy-efficient buildings.\n\nWhilst the transformative force of AI in the energy and utilities sector is clear, as with any disruptive technology, there are a wide range of regulatory and legal implications to consider. For example, the use of AI involves the collection and processing of large amounts of data, raising concerns regarding data privacy and security, and so a robust data strategy will be key. This is particularly important where data involves end consumers of energy in the form of personal data.\n\nAnother important legal consideration is the protection of critical systems from cyber-attacks. This is the subject of the EU Network Code on Cybersecurity, due to enter into force later this year. Possible exploitation routes include the AI that operates the network. Companies in the Energy and Utilities sector using open and public generative AI systems also need to consider the confidentiality issues.\n\nOther impacts to the sector include the evolution of the regulatory framework for the use of AI, including specific guidance from energy regulators. The implementation of AI also gives rise to environmental, social and governance risks, including those resulting from the potential increase in energy consumption due to AI system processing power. Finally, the impact of AI on the sector workforce, considering possible influences/biases or errors in data, or miscorrelations due to insufficient training, data or coding mistakes also require consideration.\n\nOne specific legal issue being considered at the European level (through sandbox projects and consideration of the proposed AI Liability Directive) is the issue of liability where AI systems are used in energy-related activities, for example, the trading of energy. The revised Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (REMIT), the relevant parts of which took effect in May 2024, imposes additional reporting and governance obligations on those engaging in energy trading using algorithms.\n\nAlgorithms can also be vulnerable to being exploited, or can unintentionally lead to incorrect orders being placed, so ensuring supplier liability for regulatory enforcement in such cases is important. The complexities of these issues demand careful monitoring and comprehension of the evolving legislation and regulator guidance, which may shape the framework of AI governance.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Predictive maintenance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy conservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synthetic media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disruptive innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

This phenomenon is evident in Hong Kong too.\n\nAbout 41 per cent of Hong Kong companies are applying or planning to apply AI technologies, according to a study released in March by the Hong Kong Productivity Council and the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Business School. It found that the average investment in AI is HK$830,000 (US$106,300).\n\nOrganisations are increasingly using AI to help in tasks from identifying new compounds for medical treatment and making investment choices to analysing consumer behaviour and delivering tailored content to customers. Employees are also embracing the convenience offered by AI-powered personal assistants, such as the automation of routine tasks.\n\nI don\u2019t need to look into a crystal ball to believe that many aspects of our lives will, to some extent, become AI-assisted, if not entirely AI-driven. It is beyond dispute that the era of AI has arrived, and that AI will fundamentally reshape our future.\n\nBut for AI to be a positive game-changer, safety is an essential consideration. As Premier Li Qiang put it at the recent World Economic Forum annual meeting: \u201cLike other technologies, AI is a double-edged sword. If it is applied well, it can do good and bring opportunities to the progress of human civilisation and provide great impetus to the industrial and scientific revolution.\u201d\n\nThe rise of AI presents some of the thorniest challenges. When this technology falls into the wrong hands, it can be a nightmare. In Hong Kong, digital impersonations of senior officers at multinational companies have tricked employees into transferring funds into fraudsters\u2019 accounts. AI\u2019s creative ability to generate photos and videos in seconds have also been used by scammers to orchestrate deepfake scams.\n\nAI also often attracts criticism for the privacy and ethical issues associated with its application. For example, the lack of transparency in AI models, from training to deployment, raises concerns that personal data may be harvested and used without consent. Data inputs to generative AI chatbots may also be stored on external servers over which organisations may not have direct control. And a recruitment process solely driven by AI may reinforce gender or racial biases, especially when the AI models have been trained on unrepresentative data sets.\n\nGiven the profound implications stemming from AI applications, last October China announced its Global AI Governance Initiative, which advocates that the development and safety of AI be treated as being of equal importance. A month later, the Bletchley Declaration, endorsed by the European Union and 28 countries including China, delivered a powerful statement recognising \u201ca unique moment to act and affirm the need for the safe development of AI\u201d.\n\nManaging the risks of AI is no easy task. Organisations may find it challenging to grapple with the regulatory landscape, given the complexity and novelty of AI technology.\n\nOrganisations in Hong Kong that develop, customise or use AI systems that involve personal data are duty-bound to comply with the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. The application of the ordinance, as a piece of technology-neutral legislation, is not affected by the technology employed. In other words, there is no lacuna. The ordinance applies equally to the handling of personal data by AI.\n\nWith this in mind, my office recently published the \u201cArtificial Intelligence: Model Personal Data Protection Framework\u201d to provide internationally well-established and practicable recommendations as well as best practices to help organisations in the procurement, implementation and use of AI, including generative AI, in compliance with the ordinance.\n\nThis model framework covers recommended measures for four general business processes: establishing AI strategy and governance, conducting risk assessment and human oversight, customising AI models and implementing and managing AI systems, as well as communicating and engaging with stakeholders.\n\nCompanies may be concerned about whether the adoption of the model framework would increase compliance costs. On the contrary, we believe that adoption of the framework would help to reduce compliance costs.\n\nIndeed, the framework provides a step-by-step guide on the considerations and measures to be taken throughout the life cycle of AI procurement, implementation and use, which would materially reduce the need for organisations to seek external advice from system developers, contractors or even professional service providers.\n\nMoreover, in line with international practice, the framework recommends that organisations adopt a risk-based approach, implementing risk management measures that are commensurate with the risks posed, including an appropriate level of human oversight. This effectively enables organisations to save costs by focusing their resources on the oversight of higher-risk AI applications.\n\nThus, the model framework has been introduced to facilitate the implementation and use of AI in a safe and cost-effective manner rather than inhibiting its use.\n\nAs Hong Kong is poised to become an international innovation and technology hub, I believe that the model framework will help to nurture the healthy and safe development of AI in Hong Kong and propel the expansion of the digital economy throughout the Greater Bay Area.\n\nAI is set to transform almost every facet of our lives. Whether AI becomes a game-changer for better or for worse hinges on our actions today. By fostering the safe and responsible use of AI, together we can build a trustworthy AI-driven world.\n\nAda Chung Lai-ling is Hong Kong\u2019s Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Qiang", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Li Qiang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hong_Kong", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Hong Kong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_behaviour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer behaviour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientific Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_opinion/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/22/2bc8660f-6535-4bde-b125-c60be00cd542_35d6c06e.jpg?itok=i45_t-sx&v=1721659338", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

This conflation of a pithy quote by physicist Richard Feynman is untrue, even though it has been relayed as fact by many industry leaders.\n\nThis perspective is forgivable because AI is a new and empirically advancing field, unlike quantum physics, a science established well over a century ago. LLM hallucinations are a pick-your-euphemism for wrong, incompetent, lying, incoherent or dumb.\n\nIt's a good reminder of how far we are from artificial general intelligence (AGI), regardless of definition and how LLMs' statistical sequencing of words is uncorrelated with intelligence.\n\nEven amid this confusion, cybersecurity marketing is plagued by attaching the latest buzzword to every product, with little substantive innovation or differentiation, rendering it meaningless. Anomaly detection, zero trust and XYZ detection response have all been rebranded as AI.\n\nRegardless of what constitutes AI, some version of near-fully automated systems is essential today. Humans are inefficient and incapable of keeping up with today's cyberattacks.\n\nThis is why the issue of AI cybersecurity is difficult to address, much less fix. Would the best AI-powered anomaly detection tools have flagged the errors generated by AI tools? No, because they are based on the vast training data scraped from the internet, much of it wrong. AI is incapable of intelligent decision-making in novel cyberattacks because, by definition, it has not learned anything that was not already in its training data.\n\nEven with countless machine learning and AI models, datasets and apps in the open-source communities, AI can only grow incrementally without a bigger quantum computer. The next leaps forward will require a hybrid quantum solution. Until then, there are difficult-to-quantify questions about AI.\n\nThe ability to advance AI fast enough will create cybersecurity problems because new attacks are truly insidious. The goals are transitioning from stealing data and doing reconnaissance to modifying the AI control systems and training data. One example is the Hugging Face security breach, where access keys and tokens to authenticated services were compromised. No information about the attackers and methods has been disclosed.\n\nThere are similarities here to the Storm-0558 compromise of Microsoft's master signing key, which allowed hackers to \"gain full access to essentially any Exchange Online account anywhere in the world,\" according to the Cyber Safety Review Board. Setting aside the fact that a god-like key should not exist, a year has passed, and we still don't know how it happened.\n\nIt is false to claim that AI LLMs are not well understood. The premise is absurd: It would mean that AI-powered cybersecurity companies want you to use their tools even though they don't know how or why they work.\n\nThat said, safety and security measures are not built into AI systems, nor is it rational to expect an AI expert to have the skills to understand how to do so. Cybersecurity company products fail regularly, so it would be unrealistic to expect an AI developer to anticipate the sophisticated intrusion methods used by nation-states.\n\nThat doesn't mean the industry can't work to bridge the gap. There was outrage recently about OpenAI appointing former NSA director Paul Nakasone to its board. Despite concerns, this should be considered a rational step in the right direction. Few people can claim Nakasone's knowledge of the adversary's capabilities and nefarious AI objectives.\n\nAs we further automate and add AI decision-making to our critical infrastructure, we need extraordinary security guarantees, not amazing AI functionality with dubious safety measures. These must include third-party evaluation and validation of AI tools used for cybersecurity, which must have some government regulation attached.\n\nVirtually every important industry has compliance requirements with consequences ranging from financial to industry sanctions and decertification. AI cannot be an exception when entrusted with so much responsibility. The demand must be driven by corporate adopters of any technology, not the technology producers and advocates.\n\nWhile the fears over deep fakes grab headlines, quiet versions of this methodology by external adversaries are the real threat.\n\nThink Stuxnet, where fake sensor data tricked an automated nuclear technology control system into self-destruction. The zero-day Log4j also scored 10 out of 10 in CVSS severity because it allowed remote control and code execution of vulnerable systems.\n\nThere is no equivalent rating system when compromised AI already has control by design. Triggering a desired response may only require certain conditions to be met from data or sensor feeds informing the AI control plane.\n\nThese are the invisible machine-readable equivalents of the celebrity deep fakes grabbing headlines, but they are far more impactful. The core methodology is the same -- create a corrupted imitation of what a human or AI \"sees\" to precipitate the attacker's desired toxic response and objectives.\n\nWhen larger quantum computers become available, these channels can be compromised with hacker-engineered data by brute force, even if they are strongly encrypted. This has the newly coined name Quantumbleed and should have a whimsical but apocalyptic CVSS severity score of 11 because it affects virtually all digital systems deployed today. There should be an AI name alluding to digital mind control \u00e0 la MKUltra but paying homage to its grandfather Stuxnet -- Stultra, Muxnet?\n\nThe problem is difficult, and the solutions are complex, but they are manageable if we understand that no new buzzword will fix them. The race to deploy AI with built-in quantum security must be table stakes when discussing critical systems.\n\nThese technologies are too important to our economy to ignore, but safety first. Architecting security into the core is far cheaper than remediation later. This must begin with hiring a team or assigning existing staff to develop expertise in both domains before deploying these technologies.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

While this presents an opportunity, it also creates two problems. First, customers often lack clarity on what they want or need from AI, leading to unused budgets. Second, these budgets are not incremental; they divert funds from other IT spending. What advice do you have for helping partners tap into these AI budgets?\n\nANSWER: Artificial intelligence is the next significant technology wave expected to drive revenue and profitability growth. Boards of directors at enterprise companies have mandated their management teams to devise and implement AI strategies to avoid being left behind in this market trend and falling into a competitive disadvantage. Companies of all sizes are looking to AI to optimize their operational processes, offset talent shortages, and improve customer experiences.\n\nThis surge in customer interest in AI is driving up estimates of AI spending. Depending on the market or financial analyst firm you follow, the amount of money poured into artificial intelligence is staggering. The most conservative estimates project that businesses will spend about $40 billion on AI applications and resources in 2024, with spending increasing at a 55% CAGR through 2027, reaching $150 billion. Other analysts estimate AI spending will exceed $500 billion by 2027, with a total economic impact of more than $1 trillion on the U.S. economy alone by 2030.\n\nUnfortunately, this spending isn't necessarily incremental. Businesses are shifting IT spending away from other investments in favor of AI. The problem is that businesses lack clear use cases for their artificial intelligence budgets. Most vendors aren't selling IT products but rather applications infused with AI features that augment and enhance existing functionality or add new features that enrich their applications. This is good, but it is also what customers expect.\n\nAt the enterprise and midmarket levels, vendors are betting that artificial intelligence is an on-premises system, meaning that most buyers won't opt to place their AI systems and data in public clouds due to the high cost of data transfers. AI consumes a lot of bandwidth and processing power, which increases costs. Even cloud-based AI applications place limits on the number of queries or processes because of the processing costs. The high-processing consumption drives up costs.\n\nFrom the Channelnomics perspective, artificial intelligence budgets will likely follow what the market and channel have seen in previous technology innovation waves: a mix of investments across new applications and substantial spending on upgrading legacy infrastructure and technologies to accommodate AI use cases. According to IDC, about one-third of artificial intelligence budgets this year will go toward hardware upgrades, accounting for the projected 10% increase in data center equipment spending and a 3% increase in PC refreshes. (Note: the PC refresh is also a result of many machines bought during the pandemic aging out and Microsoft's end of life of Windows 10.)\n\nThe best short-term strategy for tapping into artificial intelligence budgets is addressing the underlying foundational technology needs. Businesses will want to take full advantage of AI applications, but they need the foundational elements to do that. The foundation goes beyond hardware refreshes. Channelnomics has identified seven challenges to AI adoption - insufficient infrastructure, poor data management, lack of AI talent, security and data integrity, undefined use cases and outcomes, power constraints, and limited AI ecosystems. Vendors and partners will likely find short-term success in helping customers address these challenges, setting up their organizations for future success with AI adoption and implementations.", "source": {"uri": "channelnomics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Channelnomics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-premises software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compound annual growth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Data Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bandwidth (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategic Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://channelnomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/DALL\u00b7E-2024-07-25-07.40.31-A-futuristic-scene-showcasing-the-integration-of-artificial-intelligence-and-finance.-In-the-foreground-there-is-a-humanoid-robot-interacting-with-di.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

This lack of effective knowledge sharing hurts collaboration, creates massive inefficiency and harms the bottom line.\n\nMedia, marketing and technology professionals must recognize that this challenge isn't just a minor inconvenience -- it's a threat to innovation, competitiveness and long-term sustainability.\n\nInstead of efficiently managing information, everyone feels overwhelmed. Critical insights get lost in the noise and the ability to distill meaningful information is being eroded.\n\nInformation comes in various formats -- text, audio, video and images -- each requiring different processing approaches. Getting quality information can involve opening tickets and waiting for hours or even days. This constant exposure to vast amounts of information leads to decision fatigue and reduced productivity, creating a significant cognitive burden.\n\nTime, once an ally, has become an adversary. The relentless pressure for rapid turnarounds has created a culture of high-speed production where depth and nuance are unaffordable luxuries. There's little room for thoughtful analysis or creative breakthroughs. This constant time pressure not only affects the quality of work but can also lead to burnout and reduced job satisfaction.\n\nIn an industry dedicated to storytelling, media and marketing professionals are often unable to leverage their rich history and institutional knowledge. Many organizations possess vast archives that are difficult to search and use effectively, yet accessing this historical information is vital for providing context to current events.\n\nAI isn't just a tool; it's the key to transforming the media landscape.\n\nAI can turn information overload into intelligence overflow, sifting through the noise and uncovering insights that would take human analysts weeks to find. With AI, data isn't simply managed -- its potential is unleashed, providing access to accurate, up-to-date information that leads to smarter decisions. Sales teams get quick insights to drive strategy, content producers can access demographic data to tailor stories, and leaders can view real-time metrics on content and business performance.\n\nAI speeds up workflows while cutting down the tedium and grind of data processing. In the chaotic world of media, AI brings order and efficiency by creating a unified knowledge ecosystem. It enhances collaboration and innovation, allowing teams to build on each other's ideas and solve problems faster. By breaking down the silos that have long plagued the industry, AI enables seamless collaboration across teams and departments.\n\nA centralized knowledge system reduces the time employees spend searching for information and allows new hires to quickly familiarize themselves with company resources. Strategically, it enhances organizational agility, enabling swift adaptation to new challenges and opportunities. With AI, everything becomes faster and less burdensome, letting media and marketing professionals focus on creativity and storytelling instead of data management.\n\nConsider the transition from paper to email. Before email, the limitations of physical communications were an accepted part of business life. Delays, lost correspondence and the sheer physical bulk of document storage were just \"how things were done.\" Email was initially met with skepticism and resistance, but it quickly became clear that this technology wasn't just an improvement, it was a paradigm shift.\n\nAI is at a similar inflection point with skeptics and resistors. Concerns about AI hallucinations -- where AI generates false or misleading information -- are valid. Questions about controllability and the potential for AI to spiral out of control keep many executives up at night. But a reality check: Just as spam filters, encryption and communication policies were created for email, AI is rapidly evolving to address these concerns.\n\nAdvanced AI systems, particularly those like Qatalog that are designed to work with contained datasets from existing systems, have made significant strides in reliability and controllability. For example, when AI is working with verified, internal data rather than the wild west of the open internet, the risk of hallucinations drops dramatically. This is not about unleashing a free-for-all AI; it's about harnessing AI within your own data ecosystems to supercharge your capabilities.\n\nMoreover, the development of explainable AI and robust auditing tools provides unprecedented control over AI outputs. We're moving towards a future where AI isn't a black box, but a transparent, controllable tool that augments human intelligence rather than replacing it.\n\nIn an industry where knowledge is currency, AI-powered knowledge work transformation is becoming necessary for staying competitive and relevant. Media companies and agencies are already deploying AI for knowledge management successfully.\n\nFor instance, Cond\u00e9 Nast uses AI-driven knowledge management to personalize content for its readers, improving user engagement and driving revenue growth. Wieden+Kennedy leverages AI-powered knowledge management to connect its teams worldwide, enhancing collaboration and innovation. Similarly, Ogilvy's AI-driven knowledge management system helps professionals find relevant information quickly, reducing research time and improving client satisfaction.\n\nThe question isn't whether AI will transform media. It's how quickly media will adapt to ride this wave of change. With every technology change, early adopters have gained a significant competitive advantage. And the same will be true for AI. The time to act is now.\n\n--", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information overload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational burnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_sharing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge sharing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogilvy's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ogilvy's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond\u00e9_Nast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

In May 2023, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), outlined the federal government's strategic priorities in a National AI R&D Strategic Roadmap.\n\nThe government has made significant progress in this area with recent landmark initiatives such as the R&D funding in the CHIPS and Science Act, the U.S. AI Safety Institute, and the National AI Research Resource Pilot. This spending, however, still falls well short of the National Security Commission on AI's recommendation for non-defense AI R&D spending of more than $32 billion per year and science agencies across the federal government now face budget cuts in their appropriations for FY24.\n\nOn July 30, join the Brookings Institution for a conversation with the Director of OSTP, Dr. Arati Prabhakar, on the role of federal R&D investment in the US innovation ecosystem, especially in AI.

That kind of investment would be enough to power 12,000 products of a similar size to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Barclays analysts wrote in a recent report.\n\nOpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, kicking off a race in Silicon Valley to build new AI products and get people to use them. Big Tech companies are spending tens of billions of dollars on the technology. Retail investors have bid up the price of those companies and their suppliers, especially Nvidia, which makes the computer chips used to train AI models. Year to date, shares of Google parent Alphabet are up 25%, Microsoft is up 15%, and Nvidia shares are up 140%.\n\nVenture capitalists have also poured billions more into thousands of AI start-ups. The AI boom has helped contribute to the US$55.6b that venture investors put into US start-ups in the second quarter of 2024, the highest amount in a single quarter in two years, according to venture capital data firm PitchBook.\n\nTech executives insist that AI will change whole swaths of modern life, in the same way the internet or mobile phones did. AI technology has indeed improved drastically and is already being used to translate documents, write emails and help programmers code. But concern over whether the tech industry will be able to recoup the billions of dollars it's investing in AI anytime soon, or ever, has risen among some firms that only last year were heralding the boom.\n\n\"We do expect lots of new services ... but probably not 12,000 of them,\" Barclays analysts wrote. \"We sense that Wall Street is growing increasingly sceptical.\"\n\nIn April, Meta, Google and Nvidia all signalled their commitment to going all in on AI by telling investors during quarterly earnings calls that they would ramp up the amount of money they're spending on building data centres to train and run AI algorithms. Google reiterated on Tuesday it would spend more than US$12b a quarter on its AI build-out. Microsoft and Meta are due to report their own earnings next week and may give further indication about their AI road maps.\n\nPichai said on Tuesday that it would take time for AI products to mature and become more useful. He acknowledged the high cost of AI but said even if the AI boom slows down, the data centres and computer chips the company was buying could be put to other uses.\n\n\"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,\" Pichai said. \"Not investing to be at the front here has much more significant downsides.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment. A spokesperson for Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVinod Khosla, who co-founded computer network systems company Sun Microsystems and is one of Silicon Valley's most influential venture capital investors, compared AI to personal computers, the internet and mobile phones in terms of how much it would affect society.\n\n\"These are all fundamentally new platforms. In each of these, every new platform causes a massive explosion in applications,\" Khosla said. The rush into AI might cause a financial bubble where investors lose money, but that doesn't mean the underlying technology won't continue to grow and become more important, he said.\n\n\"There was a dot-com bubble, according to Goldman Sachs, because prices went up and prices went down. According to me, internet traffic didn't go down at all.\"\n\nAs AI changes the way people work, do business and interact with one another, many start-ups will fail, he said. But overall the industry will make money on AI. He predicts there will eventually be multiple trillion-dollar businesses in AI, such as humanoid robots, AI assistants and programs that can completely replicate the work of highly paid software engineers.\n\nBut so far, AI is not contributing to an increase in venture capital getting a return on those investments. The amount of money made in venture capital exits, which represent initial public offerings or acquisitions of tech start-ups, fell to US$23.6b in the second quarter, down slightly from US$25.4b the previous quarter, according to PitchBook.\n\nThe tech industry would need to generate around US$600b in revenue a year to make up for all the money being invested in AI right now, yet it is far from close to that number, David Cahn, a partner at venture firm Sequoia Capital, wrote in a blog post last month.\n\n\"Speculative frenzies are part of technology, and so they are not something to be afraid of,\" Cahn said. \"But we need to make sure not to believe in the delusion that has now spread from Silicon Valley to the rest of the country, and indeed the world. That delusion says that we're all going to get rich quick.\"\n\nMicrosoft's and Google's revenue are growing, especially in their cloud businesses where they sell access to AI algorithms and the storage space to use them. Executives from the companies say AI is driving new interest in their products and will become a major moneymaker in the future. However, some analysts are pointing out that there have been very few hugely successful stand-alone products, besides OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's coding assistant GitHub Copilot.\n\n\"Wall Street is growing increasingly sceptical given that ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are the two breakout successes in consumer and enterprise thus far 20 months in,\" the Barclays analysts wrote in their report.\n\nThe cost of developing and running AI programs will come down as other companies compete with Nvidia and the technology becomes more efficient, said Vineet Jain, chief executive of Egnyte, an AI and data management company. For now, the cost of providing AI products is too expensive, and he doesn't expect to make any AI-specific revenue this year. But as costs go down and demand continues to rise, that will change, Jain said.\n\n\"The value proposition is absolutely there, but the expectation right now is still unrealistic,\" he said, referring to the frenzy to sell AI products to consumers and businesses.\n\nSome start-ups have already come down from the heights of the early part of the AI boom. Inflection AI, a start-up founded by veterans of Google's famous DeepMind AI lab, raised US$1.3b last year to build out their chatbot business. But in March, the company's founders left for jobs at Microsoft, taking some of their top employees with them to the tech giant. Other AI companies, like Stability AI, which was one of the first companies to build a widely popular AI image generator, have had to lay off workers. The industry is also facing lawsuits and regulatory challenges.\n\nBigger companies like Google and Microsoft will be able to keep spending money until demand for AI products increases, but smaller start-ups that have taken on a lot of venture capital might not survive the transition, Jain said.\n\n\"It's like a souffl\u00e9 that keeps popping up and popping up, it has to come down a bit.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI boom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vinod Khosla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Programmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun Microsystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanoid robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/3TDAF6MFI5DALE3RZ53LBGK2NI.jpg?auth=943fde41b7b97618b7939deeef66a9ea21dda7b2cf14d05c7508e4e7379484d9&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer followed up the executive order with a series of AI Insight Forums to discuss the intersection of AI and innovation, workforce and intellectual property issues. As the governance of AI continues to take shape in the U.S. and around the globe, it is essential that policymakers take into account its benefits to women business owners.\n\nAI is emerging as a powerful tool to level the playing field for women entrepreneurs. From enabling informed decisions to streamlining business operations, AI is proving to be a game-changer for women entrepreneurs in terms of running and growing their businesses. Indeed, a survey by Constant Contact found 91 percent of respondents said AI has made their companies more successful, and more than a quarter (28%) of those respondents expected it to save them at least $5,000 over the next year.\n\nWomen business owners have historically faced a unique set of challenges, including limited access to capital, markets and opportunity. For example, a survey commissioned by NAWBO in partnership with Intuit QuickBooks found almost half of respondents said extra funding would have the greatest impact on their business today, if they could get it.\n\nBut AI has the potential to disrupt these barriers and open up new pathways to success. Women business owners can use AI-powered tools to save time and money, an invaluable commodity when juggling a business and family life. AI can streamline and automate basic tasks such as inventory management, invoicing, social media, financial management, and marketing, leaving women business owners with more resources to focus on growing their businesses. Tools like Notion allow women business owners to centralize all their work in one place, manage projects and optimize processes. Others like Planful help women business owners run certain financial aspects of their business, from finance and accounting to sales and marketing.\n\nOne of NAWBO's top priorities is ensuring that women business owners both have access to and are knowledgeable about tools to grow successful businesses, including AI. During our 2024 NAWBO Days event in Washington, DC in June, we asked NAWBO members to raise their hands if they were using AI, and nearly every hand in the room went up. This tells us it's no longer a matter of will they use AI, but how will they use it, and how can we ensure that they can continue to leverage it for their businesses as AI continues to evolve?\n\nWomen are already using AI to streamline and enhance productivity in their daily operations. While AI presents an opportunity to reduce the hiring squeeze, there is also the risk of worker displacement. AI must be implemented alongside workforce training/reskilling to ensure that workers can remain competitive in the labor market. NAWBO members have consistently ranked recruiting and hiring skilled workers as a top challenge they face.\n\nAI platforms are also helping women business owners make informed business decisions with data-driven insights. AI is capable of quickly analyzing large sets of data and identifying patterns that a human might miss. Women business owners can use this capability to optimize inventory, price products, or identify customer preferences -- all without the need for deep technical expertise.\n\nAdditionally, women business owners are utilizing AI platforms to navigate global markets. Language translation, cultural insights and market analysis provided by AI are helping women business owners tap into international opportunities that were once difficult to access. For example, research has shown eBay's machine translation service to have increased exports on the platform by 10.9 percent. Importantly, the International Trade Commission has found small businesses that export have higher total revenue growth and outperform those that do not.\n\nThe dismantling of traditional barriers, alongside the adoption of entrepreneur-supportive practices such as open-source programming, has carved out fresh opportunities for female entrepreneurs. Open-source programming is provided at no cost by a range of organizations including corporations, nonprofit entities and governmental bodies. This approach empowers women entrepreneurs to develop innovative products, add value and address contemporary challenges through their distinct viewpoints. For instance, the female-led startup Evidently AI, hailing from San Francisco, is at the forefront of this movement, creating an open-source tool designed to assess, identify and rectify problems within machine learning models.\n\nIn conclusion, AI is playing a pivotal role in empowering women business owners by enhancing decision-making, offering resourceful solutions and unlocking new possibilities. It is incumbent upon policymakers to nurture this trajectory by extending training, resources and bolstering the support ecosystem for women embarking on the path of AI integration in business.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Women_Business_Owners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Women Business Owners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBooks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QuickBooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine translation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a2c2861d9f71d5a3fad213/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

This underscores the fact that AI technology still needs time to mature and evolve before AI-driven solutions become more widespread and practical.\"", "source": {"uri": "betanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BetaNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_barker@betanews.com", "name": "Ian Barker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Log analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "System administrator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial and error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shrugging-businessman.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, the current involvement of various tech companies in the development of AI means that some future AI stocks have yet to reach their potential.\n\nCompanies that currently focus on applying the machine learning software capabilities of AI are more likely to have a broader impact on the tech industry, thereby generously growing their valuations. These companies are currently exploring new avenues for AI applications through research and development, as well as the launch of novel products.\n\nInvestors may want to keep a close eye on these currently broad tech companies that could become highly critical future AI stocks. As always, these companies have been selected on both the merits of their financial performance and their ability to provide long-term stability.\n\nUnderstanding the several future-proof technologies that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is currently developing is critical to capturing its potential among future AI stocks. Unlike other big tech names in the industry, IBM has always focused on advancing the technological edge for its customers' benefit. As a result, investing in IBM is more like investing in a state-of-the-art laboratory always focused on the next revolutionary technology.\n\nFor investors looking to maximize their AI potential, IBM represents a synergistic combination of both computing technology and AI research. This stems from its advanced progress in the field of quantum computing alongside its expertise in large language models through its Watson platform.\n\nWhile neither of these two components is a current major revenue source for IBM, should it continue to integrate them, it might be able to achieve a human-computer interface that enables its customers to directly interact with the Watson LLM to operate its highly complex supercomputers.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become arguably the most important company when it comes to AI data centers thanks to its cloud computing business unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). For the company, its growth will come from the endless need for its servers and processing power that a future AI-driven tech industry will need.\n\nAs more and more companies and consumers adopt the technology, Amazon Web Services will likely see even more revenue growth. This will continue to propel the company's share value over the years so long as demand for AI products increases.\n\nAs such, AMZN stock could be a safer play among AI stocks as it aims to dominate the computing infrastructure space necessary for AI services. Pair this ambition with a potential easy-on-AI approach from the next administration and AMZN stock seems like an even better investment for the next four years.\n\nRecently, consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a two-pronged approach to its entry into the artificial intelligence race. The company, which has largely focused on selling its products as high-quality and accessible renditions of technological trends, has now begun the process of integrating ChatGPT directly into its phones alongside its own interpretation of artificial intelligence which it calls \"Apple Intelligence.\"\n\nUp until now, Apple was not part of the AI industrial revolution. It might not yet be a contributor on the level of Microsoft, but what it will achieve is bringing AI to the masses over time. Right now, the most common device all consumers around the world use is the smartphone, of which many are made by Apple.\n\nAs Apple devices improve and integrate with AI, AAPL stock will become one of the future AI stocks to keep a close eye on.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

An RMIT expert comments on how we mitigate the risk to workers as AI is integrated into workforces.\n\nDr Emmanuelle Walkowiak, Vice Chancellor's Senior Research Fellowship\n\n\"GenAI represents a profound transformation in human-machine interaction and collaboration, as machines and workers can 'communicate' through a common language.\n\n\"This technology can drive significant productivity gains in the workforce.\n\n\"However, optimising these productivity gains sustainably depends on protecting workers' fundamental rights like fair wages, working conditions and job security as AI becomes more widely deployed.\n\n\"Our research at RMIT shows that with GenAI, productivity and risks are inseparable. These risks include privacy breaches, cybersecurity, breach of professional standards, bias, misinformation, accountability, and intellectual property risks.\n\n\"Our findings are clear: workers are highly exposed to AI risks.\n\n\"Importantly, AI will never be a 'workforce' and we will not have 'AI workers'. The idea of reporting 'digital workers' (i.e. technology) as we report human employees is non-sensical.\n\n\"If you naively consider AI as an autonomous agent at work, you should audit your AI risks.\n\n\"Language like this promotes the well-known narrative of job displacements by technology and gives incentives to embody it into workplace organisational processes.\n\n\"It dangerously dehumanises work and the potential brought by digital transformation to complement workers.\n\n\"It is true that we need to design new AI-resource management practices to mitigate AI risks and ensure a safe and ethical deployment of AI.\n\n\"The role of HR management should be to upskill workers to use AI, improve job quality with AI, ensure that the distributional effects of AI are shared, and support collective bargaining for the deployment of AI.\n\n\"We must upskill computer scientists to underpin this technology with ethical parameters and new procedures to protect data privacy, as well as avoid worker surveillance through AI monitoring, control wage theft, and identify accountability rules for AI decisions impacting workers.\n\n\"This is how we optimise the return on investments in AI at work.\"\n\nEmmanuelle Walkowiak is Vice-Chancellor's Senior Research Fellow at RMIT in the School of Economics, Finance and Marketing.

As technology seems to be a way of life, a drastic change in knowledge acquisition and transmission can be observed. Be it personalised digital tutors, virtual interactive classrooms or adaptive learning platforms, AI is transforming the ways we learn, communicate, and grow. Going forward, the integration of AI in education is going to alter how we teach and learn. AI has the potential to develop a workforce with the required skills and capabilities to deal with future challenges smartly.\n\nArtificial intelligence is already reshaping the educational landscape for students and teachers alike by revolutionizing learning experiences and enhancing instruction methodologies. It helps shape a new breed of professionals possessing the skills to innovate and excel in the digital age. The smooth integration of AI into educational designs comes with several benefits. Through personalised learning pathways, real-time feedback loops, and global accessibility, AI-powered educational tools are transforming the way knowledge is acquired and applied. This shift not only empowers students with essential skills to succeed in the digital era but also breaks down the barriers for an equitable and globally accessible learning ecosystem.\n\nEducational institutions that have incorporated AI-embedded models are at the forefront of preparing the next generation of professionals. These models not only provide a solid foundation in data mining and computational thinking but also foster creativity and adaptability. By incorporating AI into the educational framework, institutions are building a workforce who are capable of integrating AI solutions across various industrial sectors. This workforce possesses the knowledge and skills to drive efficiency, productivity and competitive advantage for the industry. The industry's rapid adoption of AI and modern technology has raised the bar for fresh talent. Employers now look for professionals who can understand the AI application and leverage these tools to drive business growth from day one.\n\nAs the penetration of AI expands into different fields of industries and sectors, so will the demand for a workforce that is skilled at utilising these advanced technologies. The relation between human intelligence and artificial intelligence (AI) will be at the forefront of driving digital transformation within organisations. By using AI to simplify procedures, identify new ways for maximising the returns and improve efficiency, companies can gain a competitive edge in their respective industries.\n\nTo gain more from AI-enhanced education and prepare students for their careers, both universities and students themselves have to play a crucial role. Universities can integrate AI-focused curricula, AI-driven projects, case studies, and hands-on learning experiences across various disciplines. On the other hand, students should proactively explore AI-related courses, workshops, and extracurricular activities to supplement their academic learning. Participating in hackathons, coding challenges, and AI-focused competition can enhance their technical skills, problem-solving skills, teamwork, and creativity. Besides, students can leverage online resources, such as massive open online courses and AI-focused communities to stay updated with the latest developments in the field.\n\nAI, in education, no doubt has helped in automating repetitive processes and offering tailor made learning modules. Nevertheless, human intelligence cannot be substituted. A person should continuously upskill and learn how to use AI as a tool to achieve more than AI alone. While AI shines in data processing and pattern recognition, it is unable to fully replicate human touch - empathy, critical thinking and contextual understanding. With the rise of digital footprint, young professionals should be moulded not just with technical skills but also the ability to use AI as an extension of their own capabilities. The need of the hour is to have a growth mindset, be a lifelong learner, and develop adaptability to thrive in the dynamic technological environment. By combining human intellect with AI, these next-generation professionals will be the drivers of innovation who will be contributing to digital transformation across industries.", "source": {"uri": "techcircle.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techcircle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Case study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massive open online course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamwork", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teamwork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hackathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Experiential learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mindset"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://assets.techcircle.in/uploads/article-image/2024/07/images/35112-gopalan-640.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

This, despite earlier press speculation that there was likely to be such a bill. Instead, the government simply said that it will \"harness the power of artificial intelligence\" and that it will \"seek to establish the appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models\".\n\nHowever, the briefing notes for the Product Safety and Metrology Bill did specifically note a need to protect consumers from risks presented by AI. (See our Insights: What's on the horizon for AI regulation in the UK? and our overview of the King's Speech for more.)\n\nRegulatory Innovation Office\n\nThere was no mention in the King's Speech of the new Regulatory Innovation Office that Labour said in its manifesto it would establish if it became the next government. However, the director of AI policy in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has said that this new \"regulator of the tech regulators\" will, when it is set up, have a key focus on \"supporting innovators in the economy to bring new AI products to market more quickly\". He also stated that government ministers are keen to put the AI Safety Institute on a statutory footing.\n\nThe EU AI Act was published in the Official Journal of the EU on 12 July 2024, which means that it will become law on 1 August 2024.\n\nThe staggered compliance timetable is therefore now set and the first deadline, bringing the ban on prohibited AI practices into effect, is only six months away. Businesses therefore need to be aware of the EU AI Act's requirements and start preparing now. Please see our Insight for information on when the other parts of the Act will become applicable.\n\nSetting up of AI factories now possible following EuroHPC Regulation amendment\n\nEU regulation (2024/1732/EU) amending the EuroHPC Regulation (2021/1173/EU) was published in the Official Journal on 19 June 2024 and entered into force on 9 July 2024.\n\nThe amendment allows the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) to acquire, upgrade and operate AI factories to make it easier for AI startups and SMEs to access European supercomputers. It also enhances access for users from the science community. The EuroHPC JU is a joint initiative involving the EU, European countries and private partners that was created in 2018 to develop European supercomputing.\n\nThe amendment to the EuroHPC Regulation is part of the wider package of measures the Commission announced at the beginning of this year to support AI startups and SMEs. According to the Commission, AI factories will offer a \"one-stop-shop\" for startups and innovators, allowing users to develop general-purpose AI models to support new AI systems.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_from_the_throne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speech from the throne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Science,_Innovation_and_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department for Science, Innovation and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_High-Performance_Computing_Joint_Undertaking", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

To teach computers to see and understand the world in three dimensions, a leap beyond current AI capabilities that could revolutionize industries from healthcare to manufacturing. The specifics of World Labs' operations remain somewhat elusive, but here's what we do know:\n\nFei-Fei Li, often referred to as the \"godmother of AI,\" is no newcomer to pushing the boundaries of AI. Significant contributions to the field mark her journey from Beijing to Silicon Valley, most notably the development of ImageNet, a large-scale visual database that has been pivotal in advancing computer vision.\n\nBorn in 1976 and raised in Chengdu, China, Li moved to the United States at 15. She studied physics at Princeton University before earning her Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Caltech. This diverse background laid the foundation for her groundbreaking work in AI.\n\nHer role in creating ImageNet distinguishes Li's academic career. This work has enabled the development of more accurate and capable AI models and fundamentally altered how machines interpret visual information. It set the stage for many of today's AI technologies and solidified her reputation as a leader in the field.\n\nWhile her colleagues debate the finer points of neural networks, Li is taking a two-year sabbatical. Li's Stanford profile reveals she's on partial leave from the beginning of 2024 to the end of 2025. Her research interests read like a sci-fi movie synopsis: \"cognitively inspired AI,\" computer vision, and robotic learning. Li's current job title on LinkedIn is simply \"newbie\" and \"something new,\" starting January 2024. It's the professional equivalent of a mysterious Facebook relationship status.\n\nNow, with World Labs, Li is taking on a new challenge. The company is focused on developing AI models that can understand and reason about the three-dimensional physical world, aligning with Li's extensive research background and her vision of AI that can process visual data with human-like reasoning.\n\nWorld Labs has quickly attracted significant investor interest, completing two funding rounds, with the latest raising approximately $100 million. Principal backers include Andreessen Horowitz and Radical Ventures, an AI-focused fund Li joined as a partner in 2022. This influx of capital reflects the growing investor enthusiasm for cutting-edge AI projects spurred by the success of generative AI technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThe rapid pace of investment highlights the competition among venture capitalists to support the next big AI breakthrough. Andreessen Horowitz, known for its strategic investments in tech startups, has expressed confidence in Li's vision and leadership. Radical Ventures, with its focus on AI, sees World Labs as a transformative player in the field.\n\nWorld Labs aims to bridge the gap between AI's current capabilities and the complex understanding of the physical world. The company's mission may be to create AI that can see, comprehend and interact.\n\nIn healthcare, AI with advanced spatial intelligence could assist surgeons by providing real-time, 3D visualizations of the human body during procedures, enhancing precision and outcomes. In manufacturing, AI could optimize production lines by understanding the spatial relationships between various components, possibly leading to more efficient and error-free operations.

videos\n\nThere have already been countless cases of both celebrities and everyday women having their image used without their consent to create deepfake pornography.\n\nDeepfakes are AI-generated media that mimic human voices, images, and videos that can be mistaken as real.\n\nIn February, more than 400 AI experts, celebrities, politicians, and activists signed an open letter demanding lawmakers to take action against deepfake technology.\n\nThe letter argued that the growing number of AI-generated videos are a threat to society due to the involvement of sexual images, child pornography, fraud, and political disinformation.\n\nThe letter states that deepfake technology is misleading the public, making it harder to discern what is real on the internet, and therefore, is

However, instead of using AI to keep customers at arm's length, businesses should leverage it to forge closer connections.\n\nCustomer service and communication are already leading applications for generative AI. According to The SA Generative AI Roadmap, 96.7% of businesses are either using, planning to use, or considering AI chatbots. Among those already employing AI, 55.6% report positive or very positive outcomes.\n\nThe allure of AI is evident: it provides faster, more cost-effective responses to simple inquiries, operates 24/7, and offers multilingual support. Yet, integrating AI thoughtfully is crucial.\n\nSuccessful businesses understand that innovation should enhance the customer journey, not limit it.\n\nSurprisingly, the Zendesk CX Trends Report reveals that 41% of customer experience leaders plan to increase their phone support budgets this year. This underscores a key point: AI, even in a digital-first strategy, shouldn't do everything. Innovations like AI should balance quick solutions with opportunities for customers to connect with the brand.\n\nAI excels in managing high volumes of simple queries efficiently. However, efficiency does not trump empathy, especially in complex cases. When a customer feels wronged, a chatbot exchange is unlikely to restore trust. It's in these moments that customers seek human connection, wanting their concerns heard and addressed.\n\nFor instance, a busy executive might prefer interacting with a chatbot for quick information rather than calling a call centre, whereas someone with more time might enjoy the personal interaction a phone call provides. Tailoring customer service strategies to meet diverse customer needs is vital, rather than creating internal processes merely for convenience.\n\nIf a customer resorts to a phone call after failing to get help through digital channels, the stakes are high. Businesses must ensure their teams are equipped to handle these critical interactions effectively.\n\nAs AI handles simpler tasks, human agents will tackle more complex and emotional calls, necessitating advanced training in product knowledge and communication skills.\n\nCustomers calling for help should not face poor call quality, long wait times, or multiple transfers. Data and analytics play a crucial role here, offering insights into service experiences from wait times to transfer counts before resolving requests.\n\nRather than replacing customer service, AI can significantly enhance it. Deloitte research shows that companies with robust personalisation strategies are 48% more likely to exceed revenue goals and 71% more likely to report improved customer loyalty. AI's ability to swiftly analyse data to identify preferences and past interactions provides a personalisation edge that can delight customers.\n\nWhile the future may be AI-driven, customers remain human, with unique preferences and quirks that AI can never fully understand.

The report delves into specific areas where AI adds value and its limitations and risks.\n\nThe report explores sysadmins' perspectives on integrating AI into their job roles and evaluates organizations' practical approaches to AI technologies, assessing their impact on company success over the past year. It also provides insights into sysadmins' experiences with AI implementation. Action1 researchers found that while sysadmins are aware of AI's potential, the readiness for its adoption is tempered by the need for further education and training and AI failures.\n\n\"This survey marks the second consecutive year we have conducted an in-depth examination of the impact generative AI can have on sysadmins' roles,\" said Mike Walters, President and co-founder of Action1. \"Our findings indicate that, despite some trial and error in AI implementation among sysadmins, organizations generally approach AI cautiously. Implementation projects are predominantly focused on a few IT areas, and even among those that have been implemented, results are mixed. This underscores the fact that AI technology still needs time to mature and evolve before AI-driven solutions become more widespread and practical.\"\n\nThe report's key findings include:\n\nStability in AI Perceptions: Sysadmins' views remained steady over the past year, identifying the following top three areas for AI automation in the next two years: (i) log analysis, (ii) server CPU and memory monitoring, and (iii) patch management. As with last year, areas requiring human judgment, such as user rights administration, are perceived as less likely to be automated by AI.Knowledge Gap and Training Needs: Down from 73% last year, 60% of sysadmins acknowledge a lack of understanding of leveraging AI practically, indicating a persistent gap in AI literacy. Additionally, 72% of respondents expressed a need for training, and 45% were concerned about becoming obsolete in the job market due to their current level of AI literacy.Mixed Outcomes in Current AI Implementations: While AI is most commonly implemented in log analysis (26%) and troubleshooting (25%), the highest failure rates occurred in these areas. Over half of the organizations encountered errors in troubleshooting, followed by 25% of respondents reporting failures in implementing AI for log analysis.Risk of Disruptions: Action1 researchers found that AI led to critical disruptions in 16% of organizations. These disruptions can lead to incorrect remediation steps and devastating operational consequences, such as prolonged downtime and reduced productivity.Limited Organizational Commitment To AI Implementation: Eighty percent of organizations do not require sysadmins to implement AI in their job roles, slightly down from 82 percent reported last year. While there is interest in AI, a significant gap remains between recognition of its potential and its mandated application.\n\nThe report's findings reveal that most organizations do not require AI implementation, emphasizing a tentative approach to widespread adoption. Organizations must invest in literacy and training programs to overcome the challenges, maintain a balanced approach between AI and human expertise, introduce AI in low-risk areas, and continuously track its performance.\n\nTo download the full report, visit www.action1.com/2024-ai-impact-on-sysadmins-survey-report/.\n\nMethodology\n\nAction1 collected and analyzed feedback from the company's customer base in June 2024 from 450 sysadmins worldwide.

However, according to Lyndy van den Barselaar, Managing Director at ManpowerGroup South Africa, AI is not a threat but a tremendous opportunity to enhance human potential and become truly indispensable in the workforce.\n\n\"AI might be able to crunch numbers and analyse data faster than you can say 'algorithm,' but it lacks the depth, creativity, and human touch people offer,\" says van den Barselaar. \"AI isn't about replacing humans with machines; it's about unlocking the full potential of people by leveraging the power of technology. Imagine a world where AI takes care of the mundane, the repetitive, and the predictable, freeing you up to tackle the most complex, challenging problems of our time. It's about creating a future where your unique expertise is more valuable than ever, where the specialist reigns supreme.\"\n\nThe Generalist's Dilemma\n\nIn the past, generalists were highly valued in the workplace for their ability to juggle multiple tasks and adapt to various situations. However, with AI becoming increasingly sophisticated, the role of the generalist is changing.\n\n\"AI can process data, identify patterns, and complete tasks with remarkable speed and efficiency,\" explains van den Barselaar. \"For generalists, this rapid advancement in technology may seem daunting. However, it is important to remember that humans excel at adaptation. Just as we successfully navigated the transitions brought about by the rise of emails and the internet, we can also adapt to the integration of AI. It is essential for generalists to learn new skills, embrace technological advancements, and find ways to collaborate with AI rather than compete against it. By doing so, we can expand our roles to include 'AI collaborator,' further enhancing our versatility in the workforce.\"\n\nThe Specialist's Superpower\n\nDespite AI's impressive capabilities, human expertise in specialised knowledge remains irreplaceable.\n\n\"AI is impressive and can perform many tasks, but it can't match the depth of human knowledge in specific fields. It's like comparing a microwave dinner to a gourmet meal,\" says van den Barselaar. \"Would you trust AI to perform a complex procedure like brain surgery? The answer is most likely no. Certain tasks, especially those requiring a high degree of precision, expertise, judgment, and creativity, remain the exclusive domain of humans. This is the specialist's superpower.\"\n\nBecoming a \"Human in the Loop\"\n\nTo ensure relevance in the age of AI, van den Barselaar suggests becoming a 'human in the loop' - someone who uses AI tools to their advantage while bringing their unique skills to the table.\n\n\"For instance, a seasoned financial analyst can use AI algorithms to analyse market data and identify trends. However, it's their deep understanding of financial markets and economic principles that enables them to interpret results and provide valuable insights,\" she explains. \"Similarly, a skilled data analyst in healthcare can utilise AI to process patient data, but it's their knowledge of the healthcare system that allows them to make meaningful recommendations.\"\n\nEmbracing the AI Revolution\n\nIn a rapidly advancing technological world, it's natural to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about one's place in the workforce. However, AI signifies the beginning of a new era where specialists can shape the future of work.\n\n\"Leverage your unique skills, stay adaptable, be curious, proactive, and never stop learning. The world needs your specialised expertise now more than ever. You can achieve incredible things with the right mindset and tools,\" says van den Barselaar. \"It's not about beating the machines - it's about leveraging their power to become the best version of yourself. You possess the creativity, empathy, and strategic thinking that machines can't replicate - which will set you apart.\"", "source": {"uri": "iafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generalist and specialist species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microwave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurosurgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://iafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image0011.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

It is not a lie that AI is marginally enjoyed in Southern African urban areas with a greater majority in the high density, farming and rural communities not enjoying this important communication tool.\n\nA Southern African country that is somehow prepared in terms of adopting AI is South Africa that has at least among other things achieved the electrification of all its communities including the rural areas. Electricity is one of the key aspects that is part of the Digital Infrastructure that is critical to powering computers.\n\nPenetration of AI in Southern Africa will be expected to be employed in all forms of productive processes like manufacturing, education, hospitality, agriculture, communication and so on.\n\nTo prove this case, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) consulting firm estimates the global economic impact of AI to be around US $15,7 trillion by 2030, the report indicates that of this figure US$6,6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity and US$9,1 trillion is likely to come from consumption side effects.\n\nIn light of this, Africa and Southern Africa in particular should be a beneficiary of the AI windfall expected by 2030 so as to improve its GDP as the World Bank recorded that in 2023 sub Saharan African merely recorded a GDP of 2,03 trillion.\n\nIf the Southern African countries are to benefit in Agricultural production, aspects such as monitoring soil, crop health, conduct predictive analysis for pest and disease management and automating machinery enhances farming operations, efficiency and sustainability.\n\nBe that as it may, the challenge remains that AI penetration in Southern Africa is very slow, especially in high density, rural and marginalised communities. As these communities lack the necessary investments in issues like digital infrastructure, automated machinery to carry out the Agricultural activities as well as knowledge to grasp AI issues.\n\nKnowledge on AI is truly one aspect that acts against quicker penetration of this all important ecosystem in both rural and marginalised communities in Southern Africa.\n\nAccording to the Unesco-data only around three out of every 100 graduates across Sub-Saharan Africa earn a degree in the STEM field, severely constraining the AI pipeline.\n\nConsidering this, Southern African countries are encouraged to innovate by way of creating public-private partnerships for strengthening AI circular and reskilling workforce, akin to Egypt's Knowledge City AI programme and Google's AI Research Center in Ghana.\n\nWhat is clear is that in Southern Africa urban schools particularly those for the haves can afford to teach STEM with easy as some subjects under STEM requires well equipped laboratories. This impacts negatively on equal proliferation of AI knowledge in communities, due to uneven STEM knowledge access.\n\nThe greatest challenge is that even though innovation is a powerful force that shapes economies and societies, yet it often tends to favour already developed communities, perpetuating divisions between the privileged and the marginalised.\n\nThis is despite the claims of addressing societal challenges, many innovators inadvertently neglect the needs of the most vulnerable population, focusing on those communities that can afford services.\n\nThere is really need to uplift the lives of the underprivileged as their lives matter even on issues of AI adoption. The other vital cog not to forget is the evident rural-urban divide prevalent in most Southern African countries. A lot of rural community dwellers do not own AI compatible gadgets like smartphones, computers connected to the internet and mostly rural areas in Southern African nations do not have electricity.\n\nComputer literacy is another big challenge even to rural students.\n\nTherefore, Southern African countries need to play a pivotal role in addressing the disparities attendant to access to AI in various communities of their countries, if AI discussions are meant to be treated seriously or be considered as something that benefit all Southern African communities.\n\nThis takes us to the issue of policy formulation. At the legislative front Southern African parliaments need to promote popular participation when drafting rules, regulations, standards, policies and legislation that govern AI.\n\nIn other words, there is need for a bottom up approach in the making of laws that govern the use of AI, as the laws have serious implications on their day-to-day survival of the Southern African people. This also takes cognisance of the fact that AI is going to drive most issues around production and education, including service delivery.\n\nHence the policies of this nature need to be holistic in nature to make sure that all persons understand the legislation enacted to support AI activities in each nation.\n\nIn other words, duty bearers like parliamentarians need a lot of orientation to ensure that they understand the essence and importance of AI laws in every country's development.\n\nThis also goes with members of the executive like cabinet ministers, who more often than not originate Bills that are debated in parliament.\n\nThey should receive adequate knowledge about AI through their technical teams like permanent secretaries or directors-general.\n\nAI has become so important as all life is now heading towards it, be it in farming, education, hospitality industry, health and many other aspects of life.\n\nIn view of this, Southern African countries need to be prepared for this happening with informed preparedness. The regional trade like the Southern Africa and connectivity project must also be equipped with AI tools to improve business efficiency, automating manual tasks, enhance data analytics, and so on.\n\nAI is an important game-changer in ensuring business efficacy, automating manual tasks and improving health delivery systems across the world and Southern Africa in particular.\n\nHowever, Southern Africa needs to put in place legislative and economic strategies that can see AI dividends realised even by marginalised communities by way of penetration in all communities, of their countries.", "source": {"uri": "theindependent.co.zw", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Zimbabwe Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PwC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PwC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulting_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consulting firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/theindependent/uploads/2024/07/1y8Zh8OFS1gJiQH6ofm9EEzf7UPPO3jHPzpGAhQd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

By recognising these patterns, construction managers can implement proactive measures to avoid similar issues in future projects.\n\nThe lessons learnt and this foresight fosters predictability and proactiveness in project management, leading to more successful project outcomes.\n\nAI can help predict future market trends and needs, helping construction companies stay ahead of the competition. By analysing micro and macro-economic indicators, demographic shifts, and technological advancements, AI can provide insights into emerging opportunities and potential challenges.\n\nThis strategic advantage allows construction companies to adapt their business models and strategies to capitalise on future trends.\n\nAdapting to a future driven by intelligence\n\nThe future of construction is undeniably intertwined with the advancements in AI technology.\n\nSuch a future will be driven by intelligence. Intelligence, both real and artificial, has and will make significant transformation to multiple aspects of the construction processes.\n\nTo effectively integrate AI into their operations, construction companies need to foster a technology strategy that aligns with and harmonises their business goals.\n\nInsightful companies shall embrace and invest in AI-driven solutions.\n\nThis transition necessitates a cultural shift in embracing the new normal of machines ability to think and augment human decision making and a harmonious interplay of humans and machines.\n\nEmbracing this technological revolution requires a strategic approach, a commitment to innovation, and a willingness to adapt to new paradigms.\n\nAs we move towards a future where AI plays a central role in construction, the industry stands to benefit from increased efficiency, accuracy, and sustainability, ultimately building a better world for generations to come.", "source": {"uri": "constructionweekonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Construction Week Online Middle East"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subjectivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pragmatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Project management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule_(project_management)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schedule (project management)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Introspection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Construction management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predictability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Consulting", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.constructionweekonline.com/cloud/2024/07/25/unnamed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Adam Schiff recently noted that \"Every day, my office hears from constituents facing terrible delays with their passport applications. It's clear that the State Department, despite their best efforts, is not meeting the increased demand post-pandemic. Slow processing timelines have caused significant stress, imposed financial costs and forced constituents to miss out on important events such as weddings, funerals and long-awaited vacations.\"\n\nBut with passport applications up by almost 10% YOY in 2023 and travel set to boom beyond pre-Covid levels, HelloGov AI -- a hot new startup that launched in April 2024 -- is using AI not just to simplify and streamline the way U.S. citizens apply for passports, but has set its sights on becoming the AI layer for all government applications.\n\nWhile big travel brands like Kayak and Expedia have added surface-level AI to their offerings to improve marketing and customer experience, HelloGov has created a complete end-to-end, fully integrated AI layer that completely revolutionizes the way U.S. citizens apply for government documents.\n\nThe easy-to-use platform has AI assistants trained on the complexities of government applications to help customers at every stage of the customer journey and make sure their applications are approved first-time.\n\nThis proprietary AI can handle everything from working out which forms applicants need to fill out their application to checking for the easy-to-miss mistakes that trip up huge numbers of applicants every year. Then the platform pairs the applicants with registered couriers to reduce the time it takes to get a passport from six to eight weeks to as little as two days.\n\nBut HelloGov isn't just for passports. Their platform can also simplify the process of getting a whole range of government documents, from travel visas to vehicle registration documents to green cards.\n\nBuilding on two decades of experience in gov tech\n\nBetween them, HelloGov co-founders Adam Boalt and Steven Fox have over two decades of experience in the space and have brought that together to create a government AI layer that has its sights set on solving global issues.\n\n\"Whether you need a passport or vehicle documents or a travel visa, the process of applying for government documents is slow, confusing and frustrating. Not only are the online processes hard to follow, but information is difficult to find and -- almost without fail -- it requires a long wait either on-hold or at a government office. We saw the potential to use the power of AI to revolutionize the entire end-to-end process to make it simple for the applicant and minimize these headaches, starting in the U.S. and then rolling out around the world,\" Steven Fox told us.\n\nTo do this, HelloGov's AI can answer questions, complete tasks and act autonomously on the applicant's behalf.\n\n\"We've trained our AI on the intricacies and nuances of government documents so it can answer complex questions, complete customers' applications, work out what documents they need to provide and check their applications to make sure they'll get approved first-time,\" said Adam Boalt. \"But beyond that, it can also communicate with the government on your behalf, chase up if there are delays, track your application for you and even find you the nearest appointment at an acceptance agent. Just that task alone has saved our customers an average of 90 minutes they would normally have to spend trying to find an appointment. Our assistant can find you the closest appointments in 90 seconds.\"\n\nJust a few months into launch, HelloGov has already helped thousands of applicants -- from travelers needing to make last-minute business trips or vacations to Hollywood directors, touring musicians and TV personalities -- get their government documents approved and expedited and is on a mission to become the go-to platform for all government applications in the U.S. and beyond.\n\nModernizing industries, vertically-integrated AI and soaring valuations\n\nHelloGov is the latest in a new wave of vertically-integrated solutions that use AI to tackle the headaches, roadblocks and complexities of an industry.\n\nWith soaring valuations, these practical, vertical-specific AI products are gaining a lot of traction not just from investors, but from customers and B2B partners in industries that have typically been left behind in terms of technology and innovation.\n\nThe red thread that ties all of these AI companies together is taking tasks that are typically complex, confusing or time-consuming and simplifying them with intelligent AI.\n\nThese companies aren't creating the LLMs, they're using best-of-breed solutions combined with proprietary AI training, prompts and data plus a wealth of industry-specific knowledge and experience to create platforms that tackle pain points that have plagued traditional industries for decades.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_stojan@venturebeat.com", "name": "Jon Stojan", "type": "author",

It identifies significant weaknesses in the UK's tech infrastructure that threaten the predicted potential gains - for people, society, and the economy - from the AI boom. It also outlines the ODI's recommendations for creating diverse, fair data-centric AI.\n\nBased on its research, the ODI is calling for the new government to take five actions that will allow the UK to benefit from the opportunities presented by AI while mitigating potential harms:\n\nThe ODI's white paper argues that the potential for emerging AI technologies to transform industries such as diagnostics and personalised education shows great promise. Yet significant challenges and risks are attached to widescale adoption, including - in the case of generative AI - reliance on a handful of machine learning datasets that ODI research has shown lack robust governance frameworks. This poses significant risks to both adoption and deployment, as inadequate data governance can lead to biases and unethical practices, undermining the trust and reliability of AI applications in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, and public services. These risks are exacerbated by a lack of transparency that is hampering efforts to address biases, remove harmful content, and ensure compliance with legal standards. To provide a clearer picture of how data transparency varies across different types of system providers, the ODI is developing a new 'AI data transparency index.'\n\nSir Nigel Shadbolt, Executive Chair & Co-founder of the ODI, said, \"If the UK is to benefit from the extraordinary opportunities presented by AI, the government must look beyond the hype and attend to the fundamentals of a robust data ecosystem built on sound governance and ethical foundations. We must build a trustworthy data infrastructure for AI because the feedstock of high-quality AI is high-quality data. The UK has the opportunity to build better data governance systems for AI that ensure we are best placed to take advantage of technological innovations and create economic and social value whilst guarding against potential risks.\"\n\nBefore the General Election, Labour's Manifesto outlined plans for a National Data Library to bring together existing research programmes and help deliver data-enabled public services. However, the ODI says that first, we need to ensure the data is AI-ready. As well as being accessible and trustworthy, data must meet agreed standards, which require a data assurance and quality assessment infrastructure. The ODI's recent research has found that currently - with a few exceptions - AI training datasets typically lack robust governance measures throughout the AI life cycle, posing safety, security, trust, and ethical challenges related to data protection and fair labour practices.

Moreover, the current involvement of various tech companies in the development of AI means that some future AI stocks have yet to reach their potential.\n\nCompanies that currently focus on applying the machine learning software capabilities of AI are more likely to have a broader impact on the tech industry, thereby generously growing their valuations. These companies are currently exploring new avenues for AI applications through research and development, as well as the launch of novel products.\n\nInvestors may want to keep a close eye on these currently broad tech companies that could become highly critical future AI stocks. As always, these companies have been selected on both the merits of their financial performance and their ability to provide long-term stability.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM)\n\nUnderstanding the several future-proof technologies that International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is currently developing is critical to capturing its potential among future AI stocks. Unlike other big tech names in the industry, IBM has always focused on advancing the technological edge for its customers' benefit. As a result, investing in IBM is more like investing in a state-of-the-art laboratory always focused on the next revolutionary technology.\n\nFor investors looking to maximize their AI potential, IBM represents a synergistic combination of both computing technology and AI research. This stems from its advanced progress in the field of quantum computing alongside its expertise in large language models through its Watson platform.\n\nWhile neither of these two components is a current major revenue source for IBM, should it continue to integrate them, it might be able to achieve a human-computer interface that enables its customers to directly interact with the Watson LLM to operate its highly complex supercomputers.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become arguably the most important company when it comes to AI data centers thanks to its cloud computing business unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). For the company, its growth will come from the endless need for its servers and processing power that a future AI-driven tech industry will need.\n\nAs more and more companies and consumers adopt the technology, Amazon Web Services will likely see even more revenue growth. This will continue to propel the company's share value over the years so long as demand for AI products increases.\n\nAs such, AMZN stock could be a safer play among AI stocks as it aims to dominate the computing infrastructure space necessary for AI services. Pair this ambition with a potential easy-on-AI approach from the next administration and AMZN stock seems like an even better investment for the next four years.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nRecently, consumer tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a two-pronged approach to its entry into the artificial intelligence race. The company, which has largely focused on selling its products as high-quality and accessible renditions of technological trends, has now begun the process of integrating ChatGPT directly into its phones alongside its own interpretation of artificial intelligence which it calls \"Apple Intelligence.\"\n\nUp until now, Apple was not part of the AI industrial revolution.

Customer data is hoarded away on a database or other distant location, in the hopes that eventually it will come in useful, but all too often that single cohesive view of a customer is exactly that - a hope, rather than a reality.\n\nAt the same time, every brand is working to find ways to deliver personalized, meaningful interactions with each customer. Here there is somewhat of a mismatched perception - with 81% of brands saying they understand customers deeply, but just 46% of consumers agreeing, according to Twilio's 2024 State of Customer Engagement report. Linking the two is at the core of an effective data strategy - and it's where the combination of artificial intelligence into that strategy becomes additionally effective. AI can help automate data collection, integration and analysis processes, establishing the workflows that can pave the way to more meaningful customer experiences.\n\nThe first use case for using AI to assist with data strategies is in collecting customer data more efficiently. In conjunction with a customer data platform (CDP), which offers a unified view of the customer with clean, consented and consistent data, leveraging every data source your company has, AI can serve as a professional organizer of customer data. It can categorize data points, identify correlations and store it in a way that's easily retrievable and actionable. AI can also make suggestions on how this data could be put to work - which kinds of personalization might be most effective for a given customer base, for example.\n\nOnce that data is collected and organized, it's time to put it to work - and again AI can help. Let loose to analyze vast datasets, data teams can leverage AI to tailor their strategies and carry out informed testing and comparison. Segmenting audiences, triggering tailored campaigns, and optimising messaging and delivery times - AI can help do all of this at scale, allowing teams to focus on the bigger-picture strategy instead of dedicating time to the process.\n\nA third use case for AI in this world of customer engagement is in creating golden profiles - an ideal state where a business has a comprehensive, accurate, and dynamic representation of a customer, which is continually updated as new data and insights they contain are captured. 64% of companies surveyed for Twilio's 2024 State of Customer Engagement said they are already using AI to build a unified view of every customer, which is promising but also shows how much work there is still to be done. This status can be a real game changer for businesses looking to make their marketing communications work harder. AI can help integrate data from traditionally siloed locations into one cohesive profile, cleansing and correcting inconsistencies in the process.\n\nAs organizations become more comfortable using AI in their data strategies, it's also likely to play in a role in maintaining data privacy and compliance. We're already seeing many cybersecurity tools using AI to analyze and triage evolving threats to data security, for instance. AI could also make obtaining customer consent more straightforward, by analyzing user interactions and offering choices based on those preferences.\n\nThe rise to prominence of wholly digital customer experiences has led to the creation of journey orchestration as a discipline - with entire specialist teams in larger organizations dedicated to building and fine-tuning the customer journey so the brand remains as engaging and easy to interact with as possible.\n\nAI again has an invaluable role to play here in offering predictive analytics, providing forecasts of behaviours and preferences to allow data teams to customise the journeys customers take in real-time. Thanks to the processing power of AI, marketing campaigns can be analyzed and adjusted on an ongoing basis, to ensure customer experiences are as relevant and engaging as possible.\n\nFinally, those engaging experiences are no longer based on traditional demographics thanks to AI. Static audience lists and broad segment categories are a thing of the past in a world where AI allows companies to dynamically segment audiences according to their evolving behaviors. AI can help companies build more responsive, targeted, and effective campaigns as new interaction and purchase data come in.\n\nWe've featured the best CRM for small business.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customer data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_data_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer data platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2fTNETW2pThAt9VGi9zXW8-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

This technological leap is not confined to the realm of autonomous vehicles; it permeates every facet of the automotive world. From the assembly lines where vehicles are born to the roads they traverse, AI is redefining the very essence of mobility.\n\nAt the forefront of this revolution are autonomous vehicles (AVs), which are no longer figments of science fiction but tangible realities of today's roads. AI algorithms enable them to interpret complex sensory data, make split-second decisions, and navigate through the unpredictable dynamics of real-world traffic. The continuous learning capabilities of machine learning algorithms ensure that with every mile driven, AVs become safer and more adept at handling the nuances of driving.\n\nAI's role in the automotive sector extends well beyond the driver's seat. It is the invisible hand guiding advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), optimising supply chain management, and personalizing the in-car experience with smart assistants. AI's analytical prowess is also transforming decision-making processes, enhancing real-time vehicle diagnostics, and revolutionising maintenance and safety protocols.\n\nIn the realm of manufacturing, AI is the catalyst for smarter, more efficient production lines. It enables the analysis of vehicular data and sales figures, allowing for the modeling and regulation of production processes with unparalleled accuracy and real-time insights. This optimization not only reduces costs but also elevates the quality of the final product.\n\nNavigating the Regulatory Landscape\n\nAs the automotive industry embraces AI, it must also navigate a complex legal landscape. At EU level, the AI Act classifies AI systems according to their risk levels, with different levels of obligations depending on the risk posed by AI systems. Systems deemed high-risk can substantially impact human health, safety, or basic rights, and AI systems used in autonomous vehicles (AVs) epitomise this. Should an AI system in an AV malfunction, it could result in tangible outcomes such as road accidents or privacy violations.\n\nVehicle manufacturers and providers of AI systems for Avs will therefore have to carefully examine the Act's risk-based classification and the possibility of related obligations, especially regarding the high-risk category. The possible new obligations stemming from the EU AI Act would also have to be considered within the broader landscape of the current regulatory framework for vehicles, in particular the Type approval framework and the General safety regulation.\n\nTowards an AI-Integrated Future\n\nAI is not merely a technological upgrade for the automotive industry; it is a transformative force that is reshaping the sector from the ground up. As the industry accelerates towards an AI-integrated future, the synergy between technological advancements and regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act will be pivotal. The automotive industry must adapt, innovate, and collaborate to harness the full potential of AI while ensuring compliance and public trust.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advanced driver-assistance system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seismology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Production line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Synergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location_and_Tracking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location and Tracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The means and methods traditionally employed by government face a significant challenge posed by the advent of disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence, the changing nature of physical and cyber threats, and the impact of social media and miscommunication on society. This partnership will share insights on how our homeland community can build resilience in thinking and action, innovate while running, and stay ahead of the enemy. Through an on-going column and paired webinars, we will explore how best practices, questions about the unknown, and insights from several IBM Center initiatives can be applied to YOUR leadership thinking.\n\nGovernment is being asked to handle \"everything everywhere all at once.\" Homeland Security Today seeks to elevate our understanding of, and planning for, how numerous disparate factors interact and translate these insights into actionable goals for the homeland community.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) literacy is rapidly becoming a critical competency in government operations, particularly in homeland security. In Chapter 7 of the IBM Center for The Business of Government book, Transforming the Business of Government: Insights on Resilience, Innovation, and Performance, contributor Ignacio Cruz emphasizes the necessity of AI literacy for effectively harnessing AI and automation technologies within government agencies. This column summarizes the chapter's key elements, focusing on their implications and applications for homeland security, including enhancing operational efficiency, ethical deployment, and interagency collaboration.\n\nGiven the extensive role of homeland security agencies -- DHS and partners at all levels of government -- in border protection, disaster response, and cybersecurity, enhancing AI literacy among this homeland security workforce can significantly improve the effectiveness and ethical deployment of AI and automation technologies. For example, AI can help to analyze real-time data during natural disasters, to provide actionable insights for resource allocation and emergency response. AI literacy equips DHS and other officials with the skills to interpret AI-generated data and deploy resources more effectively. For example, AI models can help to predict the impact of natural disasters and guide preemptive measures; understanding these models allows agencies to enhance their preparedness and minimize the impact of such events. AI literacy goals regarding protection of the nation should promote a workforce that understands these technologies' capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations, and who can effectively use and understand AI-driven cybersecurity tools.\n\nAI literacy extends beyond basic familiarity with data analytics tools. It encompasses a comprehensive approach that includes workflow implementation, future use case anticipation, and strategic investment decisions. For homeland security agencies, this literacy is vital for interpreting AI-generated data and deploying resources effectively. AI literacy empowers officials to understand the mechanics of AI systems, ask pertinent questions, and ensure these systems are used responsibly and ethically.\n\nAI literacy can significantly improve the effectiveness of homeland security operations. Agencies like the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its partners can leverage AI to analyze real-time data during natural disasters, providing actionable insights for resource allocation and emergency response. AI models can predict the impact of natural disasters, guiding preemptive measures to enhance preparedness and minimize damage. This requires a workforce that understands AI's capabilities and limitations and can use AI-driven tools effectively.\n\nResponsible AI deployment in homeland security involves fairness, transparency, privacy, and explainability. Ensuring the ethical use of AI is crucial in maintaining public trust and upholding ethical standards. Trustworthy AI systems must be reliable and versatile, consistently delivering accurate outputs. AI literacy equips officials with the skills to understand and mitigate the ethical implications of AI, ensuring these technologies are used to enhance security without compromising ethical standards.\n\nThe chapter outlines a three-phased approach to boosting AI literacy: Assessment, Implementation, and Continuous Learning.\n\nAdvancing AI literacy within homeland security agencies is crucial for effectively and ethically integrating AI and automation technologies.

Hao is known for her tremendous writing on AI, most notably, Artificial Intelligence is Creating a New Colonial World Order. My interest, along with other journalists who participated in the call, was to gather a crucial understanding of AI, not as just a technological advancement but as a force, as per Hao, \"reshaping the power dynamics and societal structures.\"\n\nWe've all been witness to the journey of AI, and unlike its predecessors that have shaped innovation from the steam engine, to the printing press, to the motor vehicle, society and law are unable to keep pace with AI's rapid advancements to bring safety and accountability to this technology. This has benefited Big Tech, which makes billions of dollars, and for many years experimented under the radar, with little to no consequence, while wreaking havoc in its wake.\n\nAs a writer, I have covered stories about intersectionality and systems of oppression that have shaped technology; I have called out the increasing centralization of authority as Big Tech concentration strengthens at the expense of emerging innovation; I have written about Sam Altman, and the privilege he's been afforded by Microsoft after he was effectively fired from OpenAI; I have written on the counter-narrative to the dystopian view of AI; I have written about organizations like Proton who continue to combat Big Tech Goliath, and who admonish legislation that increases surveillance across society; I have written about women in AI and the war to quiet the DEI movement in tech and in venture capital; I have written about wealthy investors like Elon Musk who have reshaped social media platforms like X/Twitter to use their power to enable freedom of speech \"without fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanction.\" I've also written extensively on data privacy, the disrupted alternatives in verifiable credentials, and organizations that are innovating towards compliance.\n\nThese are just a sample of the breadcrumbs that have come to shape what society has become today. The emergence of generative AI, how it has inherited and amplified systemic bias, how it's used to further widen political disparities, and manipulate and spread misinformation seems to be par for the course.\n\nThe AI Spotlight Series promises to bring perspective to the journalist to effectively unpack the complexities of artificial intelligence, to scrutinize the underlying technology, the data sources, the unintended consequences, the real impacts and implications to society and business. Never before has it been necessary for journalists to avoid drinking the Kool-Aid when it comes to artificial intelligence, to ensure the public receives, as Hao put it, \"accurate, nuanced, and impactful reporting\" on this transformative technology.\n\nArtificial intelligence has become one of the most talked-about and hyped technologies in the world. From chatbots that can engage in human-like conversations to image generators that can create art from text prompts, AI seems to be everywhere. However, this rapid advancement and widespread adoption of AI technologies has created a significant challenge for journalists tasked with reporting on these developments.\n\nHao, a former senior editor at MIT Technology Review, identifies the problem as two-fold. First, there's the complexity of the technology itself. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches, from simple machine learning algorithms to complex deep neural networks. Understanding these technologies well enough to report on them accurately requires a level of technical knowledge that many journalists may not possess.\n\nSecond, there's the issue of separating fact from fiction, hype from reality. As Hao points out, \"AI is sort of this big tent term that refers to all of these many different technologies. And Marvin Minsky, another founding father of AI... calls AI a suitcase word. So, you can shove whatever meaning you want into the suitcase and suddenly it becomes AI.\"\n\nIn 2018, Hao wrote, \"Some experts believe that machine learning and deep learning will eventually get us to AGI with enough data, but most would agree there are big missing pieces and it's still a long way off. AI may have mastered Go, but in other ways it is still much dumber than a toddler.\"\n\nToday, the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), popularized as the new term for achieving human-level AI capabilities, remains deeply rooted in the original goal of recreating human intelligence.\n\nThis ambiguity on the definition of AI, combined with the often-exaggerated claims made by companies and researchers in the field, makes it challenging for journalists to provide accurate, balanced, and critical coverage of AI developments. As per Hao, when large language models (LLMs) emerged, there was less transparency from AI companies about the details of their systems, including the amount of compute used as well as the contents of their training data. Over time, we've witnessed the fallout from the pervasive data scraping of these large language models including responses to poison the LLMs because of artist copyright infringements, as well as the exacerbation of online sexual exploitation.\n\nRecognizing these challenges, Hao led this initiative to equip reporters with the knowledge and tools they need to cover AI effectively and responsibly.\n\nThe first track I attended was an introductory to AI reporting. The second track, in the series is a six-hour interactive program that delves into the questions journalists should be asking, and addressing things like misinformation, differing techniques employed to mitigate data risks, and insider sourcing methods within companies or government.\n\nThis 360-degree view is aimed to help journalists understand the technology's capabilities and limitations and enable them to engage in stories with more critical thought to cut through the hype and ask the right questions.\n\nHao identified several common pitfalls that reporters often encounter when covering artificial intelligence. These missteps can lead to inaccurate or misleading reporting, potentially shaping public perception of AI in ways that don't align with reality. One of the primary issues she highlights is the tendency to accept AI at face value without questioning its underlying premises. This can lead to reporting that reinforces problematic narratives or fails to critically examine the motivations behind AI development.\n\nAdditionally, Hao raises the reliance on potentially biased sources. She cautions against quoting business leaders or others with financial ties to the AI industry as impartial experts without acknowledging these connections. This practice can skew the narrative and present a one-sided view of AI's impact and potential.\n\nWhat is clear is the pervasive anthropomorphizing of AI, describing these systems in human-like terms. This can create unrealistic expectations and when people attribute human-like characteristics to AI, they may assume that these systems possess human thought processes, emotions, and decision-making abilities. In reality, AI operates based on algorithms and data sets, lacking any form of consciousness or emotional capacity.\n\nFinally, Hao emphasizes the importance of remembering the human element in AI stories, stating, \"It would be a shame to forget that the story is about people.\" Behind every AI development or application, there are people affected, so focus on how AI systems impact individuals, communities, and society at large, rather than just discussing the technology in abstract terms. Also, consider the human developers, designers, and decision-makers. Reporting should also shed light on the people responsible for creating and implementing these technologies, including their motivations, biases, and ethical considerations.\n\nAvoiding these pitfalls will help minimize the hype in the system's AI capabilities and provide relatable narratives that readers will more likely trust.\n\nSome key considerations to keep in mind, however, as Hao outlined the AI development pipeline and presented a framework that breaks down the AI development into stages: data, compute, models and applications. Journalists should be aware of the set of issues that each stage brings. As well, recognizing the limitations of generative AI is important, as Hao states:\n\n\"These systems are massive data systems. They're trained on vast swathes of the internet, and because they're so big... no one actually knows what's in the datasets that they're trained on. This can lead to biases, errors, and hallucinations in AI outputs.\"\n\nAt this juncture of AI advancement, the development of AI systems means we also need to question the motives. As Hao points out, \"The dominant vision of AI has really shifted from rule-based systems to increasingly big data and big compute-based systems... it really comes down to who is developing and who is funding AI.\"\n\nTo dig deeper into AI stories journalists should ask probing questions at each stage of the AI development pipeline. Here are some examples based on Hao's framework:\n\nHao underscores the importance of these questions: \"If you were to cover the $100 billion supercomputer story and state as fact that future AI systems could need this amount of compute, that would be entrenching this vision and making people feel like this is just inevitable. I think a more accurate statement would be 'OpenAI's vision of AI demands this amount of compute.'\"\n\nHao provides several examples of compelling stories that go beyond the surface-level AI hype.\n\nHao's own reporting uncovered the hidden labor behind AI and the story of Kenyan workers contracted by OpenAI to label violent and sexual content, leading to severe PTSD that persisted two years after the project ended. These workers were exposed to high volumes of violent and sexual content without adequate mental health support. One worker, Mofat, a 28-year-old, experienced significant personality changes, causing anxiety and withdrawal.\n\nHao emphasizes, \"When we're thinking about AI accountability, we really need to be thinking about the entire pipeline of how AI is created.\"\n\nA Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by the NYTimes used computer vision AI to detect bomb craters in Gaza, demonstrating how AI can be a powerful tool for journalism when used responsibly. The investigation used AI to analyze satellite imagery and identify hundreds of 2000-pound bomb craters in civilian areas. Every crater identified by the AI was manually verified before publication. This approach allowed for a comprehensive analysis that would have been impossible through manual methods alone.\n\nThis case demonstrates how AI can be used as a tool to augment journalistic investigations, while also highlighting the importance of human verification and oversight. As Hao points out, \"There are ways to use AI in journalism that are not generative AI... Computer vision is a really powerful tool for doing investigative work.\"\n\nHao mentions the story where \"The Oregonian, which had been covering issues about Big Tech and data centers, and ended up suing the water department of Oregon State for not disclosing Google's water use. After a year-long legal battle, Google finally conceded and the released data showed the tech giant had consumed 25% of the city's water, \"tripling its usage in just a few years\". This reporting led to increased transparency about water usage and prompted government action to limit consumption.\n\nAs Hao contends, the environmental impact extends beyond water use. Data centers often rely on fossil fuels, contributing to climate change. She notes, Microsoft recently released its sustainability report, revealing a nearly 30% increase in carbon emissions for fiscal year 2023, largely due to rapid data center expansion. This increase occurred despite the company's previous commitments to reduce emissions.\n\nThis story highlights the tension between technological advancement and environmental sustainability, offering various angles for in-depth reporting.\n\nHao also alluded to a Bloomberg's investigation that found Stable Diffusion amplifies stereotypes about race and gender.\" As these systems become more powerful, the movement to increase representation across socio-economic policy, tech, and culture to remediate the biases inherited from these systems becomes an increasingly relevant topic.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve and permeate various aspects of society, the role of journalists in providing accurate, critical, and insightful coverage becomes increasingly crucial.\n\nHao emphasizes the ongoing nature of this learning process: \"It does take time and exposure, just simple exposure to actually start getting used to this. And if you already know this, then just use it to clarify your understanding.\"\n\nShe also encourages journalists to think creatively about finding AI stories: \"Sometimes it's about casting a wide net and pushing on all of the different yarns, and then going with the easiest path because there are so many different ways to identify harms of these systems.\"\n\nJournalists must adapt and steer clear of the AI Kool-Aid. This technology is infiltrating all aspects of society, our work, our personal identities, our homes, where we go, what we buy and how we live. As AI technologies continue to advance and their impact on society grows, the need for informed, critical journalism in this area has never been greater. By understanding the fundamentals of AI, recognizing common pitfalls in AI reporting, and asking probing questions, journalists can play a crucial role in demystifying AI for the public.\n\nThe Spotlight on AI is just the beginning. However, as Hao asserts, this is an ongoing process of learning and adaptation. As AI evolves, so must the approaches to reporting on it.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to move beyond surface-level reporting on AI breakthroughs and to dig deeper into the real-world impacts, ethical considerations, and societal implications of these technologies. It is Hao's hope that that the public discourse around AI is grounded in reality, rather than hype, and that it considers the full range of stakeholders affected by these powerful technologies. Informed and critical journalism is not just valuable - it's essential.

Anyone on social media has likely noticed the uptick in AI-related posts, leading to claims it will overturn all modern aspects of life. More broadly, as global powers continue to funnel investments into AI technologies, the implications for defense strategies and decision-making processes are becoming increasingly evident. AI in C3 is no longer just an innovative tool, but is fast becoming an indispensable element for military leadership, given its potential applications and recent advancements.\n\nThe integration of AI in military operations is not a novel concept. The roots of AI in defense can be traced back to the Cold War era, when rudimentary AI systems were developed to enhance strategic decision-making and improve weapons systems. In more recent conflicts, such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, AI technologies were employed for surveillance, target acquisition, and predictive analysis. These early implementations laid the groundwork for the sophisticated AI systems seen today in the Ukrainian conflict, where advanced algorithms and machine learning models are being utilized to gain a strategic edge.\n\nAI possesses the extraordinary capability to process vast amounts of data in real-time, granting military commanders an unprecedented level of situational awareness on the battlefield. This is especially crucial at both tactical and operational levels, where split-second decisions can alter the course of engagements. During the conflict in Ukraine, commanders have harnessed AI-driven real-time information systems to monitor enemy movements, anticipate threats, and deploy resources with remarkable precision.\n\nAI algorithms can analyze satellite imagery, drone feeds, and ground sensor data to detect patterns and anomalies, providing commanders with actionable intelligence. More recently, AI has been employed to enhance target acquisition, including the use of first-person-view (FPV) drones, which have become ubiquitous as both offensive and defensive weapons. These drones, as well as others, have become essential to any commander's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) toolkit.\n\nThe ability of AI to sift through complex data streams allows commanders to rapidly identify critical information, such as enemy positions, troop movements, and logistical vulnerabilities. This capability not only bolsters the safety and effectiveness of military operations but also facilitates proactive decision-making that can preempt enemy actions. Additionally, the data pool can incorporate lessons learned from friendly and allied forces, thereby reducing the likelihood of repeat errors.\n\nAI-powered decision support systems (DSS) are increasingly becoming integral to military command structures. These systems can analyze historical data, simulate scenarios, and recommend optimal courses of action based on predefined parameters and real-time inputs.\n\nIn the Ukrainian conflict, AI-driven DSS have been tested and used to predict potential avenues of attack and suggest countermeasures. By integrating AI with command centers at the brigade and below levels, military leaders can receive automated recommendations that consider multiple variables, including terrain conditions, weather patterns, and enemy capabilities, both past and present.\n\nSuch systems not only streamline decision-making processes, but also reduce the cognitive load on commanders, allowing them to focus on strategic planning and mission execution. By leveraging AI, military organizations can achieve greater agility and responsiveness in highly dynamic operational environments.\n\nAI facilitates network-centric warfare by connecting disparate systems and enabling seamless communication between units and command centers. This new interconnectedness enhances command agility by ensuring that decision-makers have access to real-time data and intelligence from across the battlefield.\n\nIn Ukraine, commanders have employed AI-driven C3 systems to coordinate multi-domain operations, such as combined arms maneuvers and joint airstrikes. AI facilitates communication interoperability between air, land, and sea forces, enabling synchronized actions that exploit enemy vulnerabilities.\n\nBy integrating AI into C3 frameworks, military leaders can orchestrate complex operations with vastly enhanced precision and effectiveness. This interconnectedness fosters a cohesive operational environment where information flows freely, enabling rapid adaptation to changing circumstances and mission requirements.\n\nHowever, the advantages of AI-integrated battlefield management and C3 do not come without obstacles. The deployment of AI in military operations is fraught with ethical and practical challenges. Increased network signatures on the battlefield, cybersecurity concerns, and physical equipment requirements must all be considered. These vulnerabilities must be weighed against the benefits, particularly in command, control, and communications.\n\nWhile AI promises to revolutionize military operations by enhancing situational awareness and automating decision-making processes, there are significant concerns. One major issue critics highlight is the potential for AI systems to make autonomous decisions without human oversight, raising questions about accountability and the risk of unintended consequences. Additionally, algorithmic biases in AI systems can lead to flawed decision-making, potentially causing harm to civilians and friendly forces.\n\nThese concerns have incentivized international collaboration. The global community has closely observed Ukraine's use of AI in its military strategy, with many allied nations providing support and collaboration. NATO, for instance, has shared AI research and resources to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities. Conversely, Russia, with its resources limited by sanctions and embargoes, has sought assistance from countries like China and Iran to develop similar systems.\n\nAs evidenced by the conflict in Ukraine, AI-powered C3 systems are already shaping how commanders gather intelligence, plan operations, and execute missions in real-time. The ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data quickly gives military leaders a decisive advantage on the battlefield, enabling them to anticipate threats, exploit opportunities, and achieve mission objectives with greater efficiency and precision, while reducing the threat to civilians and non-military infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, continued advancements in AI technology will likely see further integration into defense systems, including the development of autonomous systems capable of independent decision-making. However, the ethical and strategic implications of AI in warfare remain subjects of ongoing debate, necessitating careful consideration of its impact on international security and military ethics.\n\nAI in C3 represents not just a technological advancement, but a paradigm shift in military strategy and operations. By harnessing the power of AI, military forces can enhance their capabilities, mitigate risks, and maintain strategic superiority in an increasingly complex and contested global environment.\n\nDefense Sector Review is an analysis of the regional and relevant security and defense issues by the team at Mercury Strategic Services, a defense consulting, training, and advisory

One of the pressing issues in AI governance is the management of risks associated with increasingly powerful AI systems. These risks include potential misuse, ethical concerns, and unintended consequences that could arise from AI's growing capabilities. Policymakers are exploring various strategies to mitigate these risks, but the challenge lies in accurately predicting and controlling the potential harms AI systems might cause as they scale.\n\nCurrent governance strategies often rely on defining thresholds for the computational power (measured in FLOP - floating-point operations) used to train AI models. These thresholds are intended to identify and regulate AI systems that exceed certain levels of computational intensity under the assumption that higher compute correlates with greater risk. Frameworks like the White House Executive Orders on AI Safety and the EU AI Act have incorporated these thresholds into their policies.\n\nCohere for AI researcher has introduced a critical examination of these compute thresholds as a governance tool. They argue that current implementations are shortsighted and fail to effectively mitigate risks. They emphasize that the relationship between compute and risk is highly uncertain and rapidly evolving. Instead of relying solely on compute thresholds, they suggest a more nuanced approach to AI governance that considers multiple factors influencing AI's risk profile.\n\nThe proposed approach advocates for a dynamic and comprehensive evaluation of AI systems rather than fixed compute thresholds. This includes better specifying FLOP as a metric, considering additional dimensions of AI performance and risk, and implementing adaptive thresholds that adjust to the evolving landscape of AI capabilities. The researchers recommend enhancing transparency and standardization in reporting AI risks and aligning governance practices with the actual performance and potential harms of AI systems. This comprehensive method involves examining factors such as the quality of training data, optimization techniques, and the specific applications of AI models to ensure a more accurate assessment of potential risks.\n\nThe research highlights that fixed compute thresholds often miss significant risks associated with smaller, highly optimized AI models. Empirical evidence suggests that many current policies need to account for the rapid advancements and optimization techniques that can make smaller models as capable and risky as larger ones. For instance, models with less than 13 billion parameters have been shown to outperform larger models with over 176 billion parameters in certain tasks. This oversight indicates that compute thresholds, as currently applied, are unreliable predictors of AI risks and need substantial revision to be effective.\n\nOne noteworthy result from the research is that smaller models, when optimized, can achieve performance levels comparable to much larger models. For example, the study found that smaller models could reach up to 77.15% performance scores on benchmark tests, a significant improvement from the 38.59% average just two years prior. Furthermore, the researchers pointed out that the current thresholds, such as those set by the EU AI Act and the White House Executive Order, do not capture the nuances of model performance and risk, as they primarily focus on the sheer amount of compute without considering the specific capabilities and optimizations of the models.\n\nIn conclusion, the research underscores the inadequacy of compute thresholds as a standalone governance tool for AI. The problem lies in the unpredictable relationship between compute and risk, necessitating a more flexible and informed approach to regulation. The proposed solution involves shifting towards dynamic thresholds and multi-faceted risk assessments that can better anticipate and mitigate the risks posed by advanced AI systems. Researchers emphasize the need for policies that evolve with the technology and accurately reflect the complexities of modern AI development.", "source": {"uri": "marktechpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarkTechPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FLOPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floating-point arithmetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empirical evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk assessment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Computer_Science/Research_Institutes", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Computer Science/Research Institutes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 25}], "image": "https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-24-at-8.42.29-PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But it's not without risks.\n\nThe tiniest pin-prick tumors might escape even the most trained human eye, but they might not evade the keen observation of an AI system. AI-based healthcare tools use machine learning models trained on large volumes of data, allowing them to recognize tumor patterns and detect them in new cases.\n\nAI use cases in healthcare are exploding - from detecting cancers and optimizing hospital bed counts to precision medicine applications. However, as the adoption of AI applications grows, so do the associated security vulnerabilities.\n\nHealthcare institutions are already stretched thin by new methods of dispensing care, like remote monitoring (from sensor-based devices) and telehealth. Outdated technology infrastructure and inadequate security policies are exacerbating the strain, said Erik Barnett, North America advisory healthcare and life sciences lead at Avanade, a professional services company.\n\n\"Additionally, the large number of smart medical devices connected to online systems has created new points of entry for attackers,\" Barnett explained.\n\nAll that data sloshing around increases the risk of breaches. Patient health information (PHI) records are extremely sensitive, and the integration of AI introduces vulnerabilities and attack methods, such as injection attacks on chatbots, Barnett said.\n\nWhen security breaches happen in healthcare, \"healthcare systems suffer a disruption in patient care continuity, through interruptions in healthcare services, billing processes, and access to electronic health records, leading to potential financial and operational setbacks for organizations,\" Barnett said. Compromised PHI can violate compliance with privacy laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\nGiven the vulnerabilities AI might introduce, how should healthcare systems use the technology? Bjorn Andersson, senior director of global digital innovation marketing and strategy at Hitachi Vantara, suggested deploying AI in the stages - crawl, walk, run - to reflect increasing difficulty and risks. \"Remember the credo, 'First do no harm,'\" he advised.\n\nThe initial patient interaction is the \"crawl\" stage, Andersson explained. \"The 'walk' part is when you operationalize the use of AI in your healthcare operations. One key challenge at this stage is [to] make sure you use the right data and have some level of oversight based on domain knowledge and an escape mechanism when human expertise is required.\"\n\nRelated:5 Key IT Certifications to Stand Out in the Healthcare Industry\n\nMeanwhile, the \"run\" stage \"involves increasing the level of automation, which also potentially increases the risks if you have [not] built the trusted foundation in the previous stages,\" he said.\n\nSecuring AI starts with basic cybersecurity practices like investing in strong authentication and access controls, said Rachel Jiang, senior vice president of product and technology at healthcare company TailorCare. She recommended encrypting and segregating patient data and ensuring secure transmission.\n\n\"Healthcare companies should partner with their customers and outside experts to establish security and privacy standards and follow emerging regulatory guidance,\" Jiang said. Furthermore, healthcare companies should regularly perform audits and educate their employees.\n\nEstablishing a secure foundation is essential as AI in healthcare continues to grow at an impressive clip. According to research firm Grand View Research, the market for AI in the healthcare will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 40.2%, reaching USD 173.55 billion by 2029.\n\nAI will significantly impact the field in various ways. For instance, it will accelerate patient-clinical trial matching processes, enabling quicker access to innovative treatments, Barnett said. Additionally, AI will proactively identify disease patterns, preventing widespread shortages and improving healthcare resource management.\n\nRelated:How to Ensure Data Protection, IT Security, and Compliance in Life Sciences\n\nIncreased AI integration will come with heightened scrutiny and compliance requirements, however. Richard Watson-Bruhn, U.S. head of digital trust and cybersecurity at PA Consulting, predicts that AI will face more regulation. Europe's AI Act is already in effect, and in the U.S., Colorado passed the \"Consumer Protections for Artificial Intelligence\" bill in May 2024. Starting February 2026, the bill will mandate assessments and disclosures for AI developers and deployers in high-risk use cases, including healthcare services.\n\nHealthcare facilities need advanced security strategies to protect data in a more AI-integrated environment. Confidential computing, which protects data during storage, transit, and computation, will gradually become more important. Confidential computing relies on encrypting data and conducting operations in a trusted execution environment, or TEE, within the computer's hardware.\n\nApart from strict data-handling protocols, the development of AI solutions will demand diverse patient representation to ensure fairness and avoid bias, Barnett noted. In addition, \"developing patient control mechanisms in mobile solutions allows them to set health goals and choose their level of AI support, fostering trust and enhancing personalization in their

Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and author of SB 1047, the \"Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act.\"\n\nLegislative analysts noted that while artificial intelligence, or AI, has potential for many benefits -- from advances in medicine and climate science to improved wildfire forecasting and clean power development -- it also poses significant risks.\n\nThere are widespread concerns it could be used to develop autonomous weapons that can select and engage targets without human intervention, with AI-enhanced drones used in terrorist attacks or to transport illegal narcotics.\n\nAI-driven algorithms have also been used in phishing attacks and malware, including the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack that exploited a Microsoft Windows vulnerability and caused billions of dollars in damage. Automated trading algorithms could lead to market manipulation, like the 2010 Flash Crash that caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to lose 1,000 points in minutes before recovering.\n\nWiener's bill would regulate the \"development and deployment of advanced AI models\" by creating a new regulatory body, the Frontier Model Division. It also would establish a publicly funded computing cluster program called CalCompute that would focus on the development of large-scale artificial intelligence models, providing operational expertise and user support and fostering \"equitable\" AI innovation.\n\n\"It is a very basic requirement to perform the safety evaluations that these large labs have already committed to perform,\" Wiener said.\n\nOpponents of the bill argue that it would stifle innovation and hinder open-source AI development. They said the bill \"fundamentally misunderstands\" how advanced AI systems are built and places \"disproportionate obligations\" on model developers that could harm California's robust tech economy.\n\nRob Sherman, vice president and chief privacy officer for Meta, said in a letter to Wiener dated June 25 that AI systems \"are built by multiple actors with differing functions.\" Those include \"the model developer who puts a model onto the market; AI deployers who build models into systems to provide a service and control use of the model; and end-users who leverage those systems.\"\n\n\"The bill's fundamental flaw is that it fails to take this full ecosystem into account and assign liability accordingly, placing disproportionate obligations on model developers for parts of the ecosystem over which they have no control,\" Sherman wrote.\n\nWiener, who's accepted numerous amendments in working with both technology companies and AI safety advocates on the bill, disagrees.\n\n\"It is a very basic requirement to perform the safety evaluations that these large labs have already committed to perform,\" Wiener said. \"If a significant risk of catastrophic harm is identified, the developers must take steps to mitigate this risk, making it harder and less likely for these dangers to materialize.\"\n\nWiener added that his bill only applies to AI developers who produce large-scale AI models -- typically developers with computing power valued over $100 million -- to implement safety and security protocols.\n\nAdditionally, the bill may penalize companies for failing to report AI safety incidents, including events that increase the risk of critical harm, models engaging in unauthorized behavior, and failure to prevent the use of AI with hazardous capabilities.\n\nViolators could face civil penalties depending on the severity of the violation. Under the proposal, a court may order the deletion of an AI model and its data if the violation involves death, bodily harm, property damage, theft, or public safety risk. There are also penalties, based on a percentage of the model's training cost, are higher for repeat offenses.\n\nOnly the California Attorney General would be able to file cases for violations, under the proposal.\n\nThe budgetary requirement of the bill is expected to be determined when it's taken up in the appropriations committee next month.\n\nWhile the bill has drawn powerful opposition, it has backing from AI safety advocacy groups including Open Philanthropy, Encode Justice, the Center for AI Safety, Redwood Research, FAR AI, and the Future Society. The Center for AI Safety sponsored a poll in May by David Binder Research that found strong bipartisan support for such legislation among likely voters.\n\nIt passed out of the Senate in May, and after passing out of the Assembly's Privacy and Consumer Protection and Judiciary committees, heads to Appropriations and a floor vote before it could reach the governor's desk.\n\nSunny Gandhi of Encode Justice said that it is important to codify public safety into AI laws now, having learned lessons from widespread disinformation on social media.\n\n\"It's better to get ahead of the curve to stop an AI Chernobyl from happening,\" Gandhi said, referring to the 1986 nuclear power plant meltdown in the former Soviet Union. \"It is a nascent technology that moves extremely rapidly.\"",

AI startups are very popular with investors. Accordingly, startups in the industry have received above-average financing over the past five years. An international study by AI developer Gieni has shown that in the past five years alone, around $41.5 billion has flowed into a total of 536 companies founded worldwide. The AI sector is therefore in seventh place among the startup sectors with the highest investment amounts over the past five years.\n\n\"The results of our study clearly show that, despite its relatively new presence on the market, artificial intelligence has already taken on a central role in the startup landscape. While traditional industries such as manufacturing and IT continue to record the highest investment amounts, the rapid development of AI shows that this technology is not just a temporary phenomenon, but a sustainable growth engine of the future,\" says Timur G\u00f6reci, Chief Revenue Officer of Gieni developer Orderfox Schweiz AG.\n\nWhile the AI revolution continues to advance, other sectors are still holding their own in the top spots. The manufacturing industry is at the forefront. In the last five years, 322 companies have been founded worldwide, with a total of around $55.7 billion invested. A younger, but now just as traditional, sector follows behind: the IT sector has gained a total of 717 companies in the last five years, with a total of around $52.7 dollars invested. The healthcare sector, on the other hand, is in third place with an investment of $50.9 billion in a total of 683 companies.\n\n\"Startups should not be forced to look at the US, Asia or other markets to finance their expansion\"\n\nAI has already managed to overtake some sectors. According to Gieni's analysis, the automotive industry is a long way behind in seventh place, with around $36.5 billion for 106 companies. Investors invested almost $5 billion less in this area than in artificial intelligence. At the same time, this also means that in recent years around five times more AI startups have made their debut than automotive companies.\n\nThe energy sector is even further behind AI in ninth place with 184 companies founded and an investment sum of around $33.5 billion. The top ten are completed by the fintechs, which were also overtaken by AI. With 528 companies, roughly the same number of start-ups were launched here as in AI.

During the exhibition, multiple Hong Kong publishers expressed their intent to engage in deep collaboration with DCG.\n\nBOOKSGPT, crafted by DCG, is the large-scale AI model specifically tailored for the publishers. It offers comprehensive foundational technical support for critical aspects such as the publishing process, the construction of book knowledge bases, and services for reader interaction. To date, BOOKSGPT encompasses over 30 publishing scenarios and more than 20 book-related applications, successfully establishing a multi-modal dataset that spans the publishing industry. Through innovative training BOOKSGPT integrates multiple models, it has achieved precise data analysis of a full spectrum of books, real-time intelligent Q&A, and personalized resources recommendations, ushering in an era of AI transformation for the publishing industry.\n\nBuilding upon BOOKSGPT, DCG introduced the cutting-edge \"AI Editor Studio.\" The studio brings together 15 AI editors, including AI topic planning editors, AI authors, AI proofreading teams, and AI social media editors, each leveraging their expertise to collaborate across the entire publishing, printing, and distribution process. For instance, during the topic selection phase, AI topic planning editors can swiftly match similar author data, providing efficient advice for topic selection and even generating high-quality marketing analysis reports within three minutes. AI authors act as assistants to both authors and editors, adept at drafting outlines, generating content, preparing materials, and refining text. The AI proofreading team is capable of reviewing text, images, audio, and video content across multiple dimensions, ensuring robust support for every step of content review. As for distribution and marketing, AI social media editors can automatically generate social media copy-writing such as Facebook and Instagram posts, Tik-Tok live-stream scripts, Amazon reviews, or Quora answers, and quickly adapt to the rules of various social platforms, proposing precise strategic suggestions based on operational data.\n\nAt the venue, DCG also showcased \"Journey in Computer,\" a collaborative publication with Excellence Publication Company Limited, integrated with AI technology produced by DCG. These publications use QR codes as an entry point to match AI services with paper books, allowing readers to scan and access the AI services while reading. With the support of BOOKSGPT, each book is matched with an AI Assistant, which is able to provide real-time Q&As, engage, and analyze based on the content of the book, greatly enhancing the reading experience for each reader.\n\nDuring the fair, CEO Shi Qiming was invited to participate in the International Publishing Forum where he delivered a keynote speech titled \"Solution for Integrating AI and Publishing.\" He discussed the latest applications of AI in publishing and provided an in-depth analysis of how AI is bringing unprecedented opportunities and changes to this traditional industry. Shi Qiming believes that with the continuous penetration of AI technology and the increasing demands for reading experiences, the Hong Kong book market is poised for broader development prospects. At the fair, VP Michael Chen and the Global Business MD Larry Li held discussions with leaders of several Hong Kong publishers, reaching cooperation intentions and signing agreements, which laying a solid foundation for DCG's expansion into markets outside mainland China. Michael Chen stated that DCG's development in Hong Kong is a milestone of the company's going-out strategy, with a commitment to provide AI products and services for Hong Kong publishers and driving the Hong Kong publishing industry to a new era.\n\nCONTACT: Jessica Chen, chenweiwen@dcrays.cn", "source": {"uri": "itnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IT News Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Montenegro", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Montenegro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Book_Fair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong Book Fair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Trade_Development_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong Trade Development Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Convention_and_Exhibition_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PR_Newswire", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PR Newswire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quora", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Non-Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Non-Fiction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Publishing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Publishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi calls its strategy \"a brand-new standard for privacy in AI\". Others however, including OpenAI founder Elon Musk were not so sure, threatening to ban the devices from his offices and branding it an 'unacceptable security violation'.\n\nMusk's outburst may be an overreaction, but it's symptomatic of some recent high-profile concerns around AI and data privacy and, in recent months, there's already been disquiet with data privacy issues surrounding Microsoft Recall, Slack, and Figma.\n\nHow will user data train OpenAI models? We don't know.\n\nApple has sought to reassure users that most of the new AI capabilities will run on device - and this would make business sense since the onus will be on users to upgrade to the latest models capable of running them. However, questions remain about other areas. For instance, Apple states that \"when requests are routed to Private Cloud Compute, data is not stored or made accessible to Apple, and is only used to fulfil the user's requests.\" Information on how user data is used to train OpenAI models is conspicuous in its absence. Furthermore, there may be different, competing data privacy preferences when users connect to their ChatGPT accounts. This should give individuals and corporations pause for thought - for now.\n\nAmbiguous AI privacy policies have become the norm\n\nSuch ambiguity is what we have come to expect from GenAI-enabled SaaS companies, and this is far from an isolated incident. In just the last few months, DocuSign updated its FAQ to state that \"if you have given contractual consent, we may use your data to train DocuSign's in-house, proprietary AI models\". Then, in May, a similar AI scare had Slack users up in arms with many criticizing vague data policies after it emerged that, by default, their data -- including messages, content, and files -- was being used to train Slack's global AI models. Reports remarked that 'it felt like there was no benefit to opting in for anyone but Slack.' After conducting our own research we found that such cases are just the tip of the iceberg and even the likes of LinkedIn, X, Pinterest, Grammarly, and Yelp have potentially risky content training declarations.\n\nPushing data boundaries\n\nAt the best of times, navigating data retention and content training declarations is hard work. More often, it's outright missing or heavily hidden, written in dense legal language, and subject to change over time. Vendors will continue pushing these boundaries as the global arms race to get ahead in AI accelerates. AI models need vast data sets to train them, and it means that vendors will be increasingly tempted to harvest as much data as they can and answer any questions later. This could be in the form of feature updates that, in effect, are a 'data grab' and deliver little value to the end user, or it could be in the form of vague policies deliberately designed to confuse which businesses unwittingly sign up to.\n\nPreviously it has been possible for organizations to turn off risky features until they have been properly understood, however we may be approaching a situation where these are so baked into the operating system that it becomes difficult to do. Can we (and should we) trust these companies to secure our data, or do we need to shift how we approach data protection?\n\nNavigating the minefield\n\nCurrently, organizations are in a tricky position - useful AI services, correctly implemented, can deliver huge productivity and innovation benefits. Simply blocking all is as risky as enabling all given firms can be left behind their peers. So what should firms do?\n\nFirstly, check the T&Cs - start with the most commonly used applications used in your organization but be aware that checking the text can be complicated as few services are forthcoming with exactly what types of data are used to train their models. The details are often buried and sometimes aren't referred to at all. Overarching privacy policies can often be the best place to guide decision-making but can change frequently so there is a need to review fairly regularly. Some of these do provide data training opt-outs, especially in the EU, which is another option for security teams.\n\nFocus on the apps you need - the challenge of understanding and tracking these T&Cs is exacerbated by the huge surge in Shadow AI. With such attention to detail required to oversee apps, it's helpful to have fewer apps to focus on. This means having honest conversations with employees to understand what services they are using and for what purpose to promote transparency and understanding of the risks posed by rogue AI adoption.\n\nIdentify Shadow AI - on the technical side, traditional cybersecurity tools like internet gateways and next-generation firewalls can also provide data to manually identify potential shadow AI instances. For companies using identity providers like Google, tracking \"Sign-in with Google\" activity can reveal unauthorized app usage. Specialized third-party solutions designed specifically to detect both shadow IT and shadow AI, can significantly improve an organization's ability to pinpoint and mitigate these technological threats.\n\nOne thing is for sure - AI only gets better the more data it has and organizations will need to carefully navigate the benefits and drawbacks of the services they use and the information shared with them.", "source": {"uri": "aithority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AiThority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slack_(software)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slack (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figma_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Figma (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocuSign", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DocuSign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data retention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yelp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammarly", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammarly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firewall (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://aithority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Apple.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

But the real test will be if the tech can make their firms more money.", "body": "The question has dominated the business world for almost two years. Once ChatGPT graced us with its presence, everyone wanted to know how to leverage the tech to get ahead.\n\nWall Street, with its reams of data and need to analyze complex topics, has always been viewed as fertile ground for the AI revolution. So Business Insider's finance team spoke with almost three dozen finance workers across the industry about how they're using AI.\n\nFrom helping to identify startups to invest in to aggregating thousands of analyst notes to cutting down the time spent on busy work, AI use cases on the Street ran the gamut.\n\nOverall, generative AI typically helped finance professionals do their jobs faster, easier, or both.\n\nNot everyone is sold. Some don't see the \"breakthrough\" possibilities of the tech that so many have prophesied, finding it hard to see specific uses of AI in their own processes.\n\nAnd to be fair, they might not be wrong. As much as Wall Street likes to tout tech adoption, certain corners remain unchanged from decades ago, albeit with a few extra bells and whistles.\n\nNot unlike the workers it's looking to serve, gen AI's future on Wall Street will boil down to its ability to produce results.\n\nAI development doesn't come cheap. Whether you're starting from scratch or buying something off the shelf, there's plenty of costs to consider, from talent to hardware to retraining staff.\n\nBlackstone expects the US to spend roughly $1 trillion over the next five years building and facilitating new data centers that'll help power the gen AI wave.\n\nThat kind of cash means investors will want to see real changes in how things are done thanks to AI. It's a question Big Tech leaders are already fielding.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alphabet executives were pressed on whether Google's AI overview feature was generating more revenue for the firm, writes BI's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert. And Nvidia has plans to show how its customers are making money using its AI chips when it reports earnings next month.\n\nThey won't be alone, as Goldman expects the market to keenly watch if AI spend can translate to revenue.\n\nAnd that's in tech where companies are supposed to take big swings on innovative projects! Now consider Wall Street, where ROI is built into the core of the industry.\n\nWill those firms continue pouring money into tech that can't improve their bottom line? In the end, finance workers' views on using generative AI, whatever they are, might not matter.\n\nThe Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

But I think the use of generative AI is here to stay,\" said Michelle Cho, an assistant professor of Korean studies at the University of Toronto. The flow guest host Rebecca Zandbergen.\n\nThe clip of Maestro features the 13 members of the band performing while surrounded by robots and other pieces of technology.\n\nThe teaser trailer, released in April,features segments created by generative AIand shows people playing classical music with robots in the background, and robots playing on what looks like some kind of high-tech keyboard.\n\n\"The whole theme of Maestro is a kind of commentary on how humans and their creative energy [are] \"We are threatened by media technologies,\" Cho said.\n\nK-pop is a multi-billion dollar industry, with South Korea to become world's seventh largest music market by 2023according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. With so much money to be made, artists and agencies are looking for ways to use AI in innovative ways.\n\nCho says the members of Seventeen are known in the K-pop community for being involved in writing their music and choreographing their performances.\n\nAnd with popular boy band BTS on hiatus during their mandatory military service in South Korea, Seventeen has benefited from the opening. The group sold 16 million albums last year.\n\nBut the group sparked controversy in April when comments made by one of the group members, Woozihas led people to wonder if the band used generative AI to write the songs for their latest album. He has since denied the allegations.claiming that the band's music is \"written and composed by human creators.\"\n\n\"A lot of fans have taken to social media platforms to express their anger at how the band has been misrepresented, because fans, I think, don't necessarily support the use of AI or the idea that artists' creativity should be overshadowed by AI,\" Michelle said.\n\nBut it's clear that K-pop groups are finding ways to use generative AI. Bernie Cho, president of creative agency DFSB Kollective, says the technology has become ubiquitous in the K-pop industry.\n\nHe says some artists are using AI to translate their lyrics, helping artists create songs in languages they wouldn't otherwise be able to sing in.\n\n\"I work with independent artists who really want to become more global, faster, bigger, better, and they use AI to quickly translate their Korean lyrics into multiple languages,\" Bernie Cho said.\n\nBands are also using AI to create art, he says, not just for albums but for every single they release, giving each song a unique feel.\n\nThere are even artists using AI to create artificially generated performers who sing and dance, all with a real person behind the wheel fine-tuning the project.\n\n\"We're starting to see AI groups battling for rankings with real groups,\" Bernie Cho said.\n\nAnd since the job still requires someone pulling the strings, he says he's not worried about AI taking over the industry.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to put me out of work. On the contrary, it's going to allow me to do more work, faster, better, bigger, easier. And so, if I can afford anything, I'm very grateful for the advent of AI.\"\n\nLegal Issues Related to Generative AI\n\nAI faces a handful of challenges, both in K-pop and other genres.\n\nFans haven't yet fully embraced the idea of an all-AI act, partly because there are a lot of things an AI can't do, like sign autographs or meet fans in person.\n\n\"Even though it looks cool from a distance, what we hear from fans is that it's not that cool. It's actually a little bit cold,\" Bernie Cho said.\n\nCharlie Harding, music journalist and host of the show Pop lit podcast, says there is also quality to consider.\n\n\"We generally like to hear songs that we think are made by an artist, that speak to an inner truth,\" he said.\n\nThen there are the legal disputes. Artists are looking formore protection against AI scanning their work to create its own.\n\nMajor music groups such as Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and Sony Music Group have all filed lawsuits against AI music generators Suno and Udio.\n\nIn May, the The South Korean government has announced plans to revise copyright laws regarding AIto \"support the development of the AI-based creative industry.\"\n\nEfforts like these could change the way the industry uses AI, Harding says.\n\n\"If we start to see precedents emerging in court cases that say, 'No, you can't do that,' those cases could really determine the future of how we use these big language models,\" he said.\n\n\"I think artificial intelligence, in one form or another, is here to stay.

Quantum AI leverages principles from quantum mechanics to improve AI algorithms, potentially surpassing the capabilities of classic computing AI models.\n\nThe framework, created by Professor Fengqi You and Akshay Ajagekar, a graduate student, focuses on utilising hybrid quantum-classical methods to improve the efficiency of energy management in AI data centres. They approximated variational quantum circuit net load demand in a simulated digital twin, managing controls with an uncertainty-aware formulation.\n\nThe model demonstrated positive results in both energy efficiency and decarbonisation.\n\n\"By developing quantum computing-based AI methods, we are tackling the pressing energy and climate challenges faced by AI data centres, significantly enhancing their sustainability and efficiency,\" You said.\n\nThe energy consumption of regular data centres is of concern to a variety of different stakeholders. Energy represents a large portion of operating costs for data centre owner/operators, so reducing consumption can have a positive impact on the bottom line.\n\nEnvironmental agencies and activists are concerned with the impact of high levels of energy consumption on green data centre initiatives; while residents that live near data centres are increasingly concerned with the strain these facilities put on the electrical grid.\n\nAll of these concerns are growing more intense with the advent of the AI data centre, which is expected to require far more energy to operate than a classic data centre. In fact, Goldman Sachs predicted AI will increase data centre energy demands by 160% by 2030.\n\nWith these predictions in mind, finding new ways to reduce data centre energy consumption is critical. If it proves effective in a live data centre, a Quantum AI solution elegantly applies the source of the issue, increased use of AI, to find a solution to the problem of increased energy requirements.\n\nIn April, a recent report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) found data centre energy consumption could double by 2026, attributed to the increase in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency.", "source": {"uri": "techerati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techerati"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_cappella@techerati.com", "name": "Nicole Cappella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quantum computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quantum mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Quantum_Mechanics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Quantum Mechanics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.techerati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Techerati-images-2024-07-25T095248.522.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The survey found that a majority of Americans are uncomfortable about the use of AI and algorithmic decision-making technology around major life moments as it relates to housing, employment, and healthcare. CR conducted this multi-mode survey of 2,022 US adults in May 2024. The full report also includes demographic insights.\n\nGrace Gedye, policy analyst at CR, said, \"Companies are using AI and algorithms behind the scenes to help determine everything from decisions about your health insurance coverage, to your prospects of landing your dream job, to who is going to get that perfect apartment you found on Zillow. We conducted this survey to get a better understanding of how consumers feel about the role AI and algorithms play in these high stakes decisions.\"\n\n\"The survey shows that a majority of Americans are uncomfortable with the use of AI in high-stakes decisions about their lives. We also found that in certain circumstances, Americans really want to understand what information an AI system is using to assess them, and want the chance to correct any incorrect information. Consumer Reports advocates for regulations that require AI systems to be more transparent, and that give consumers agency.\"\n\nKey findings of the survey includes:\n\nAttitudes toward AI/algorithms making marketing decisions\n\nPersonalized pricing\n\nDiscomfort with AI programs making decisions that affect people's lives\n\nTransparency and recourse\n\nConsumer Reports advocates for legislation at the state and federal level to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination and other AI-related harms. Clear standards are needed regarding the responsible use of AI across multiple industries so that companies are accountable for ensuring their products are safe, effective, and do not manipulate, deceive or discriminate. Consumers should be informed when AI tools make high-stakes decisions about them, and should have agency, such as the opportunity to correct any incorrect information and the opportunity to appeal a decision.\n\nConsumer Reports has been pushing for state legislation that would require companies to disclose more information about how AI tools they use in consequential decisions assess consumers. Colorado's new law, which goes into effect in 2026, will require companies to provide consumers and workers with an explanation after a company uses AI to make an adverse, high-stakes decision about him or her. California lawmakers are considering a similar bill, currently backed by CR, that would provide consumers with even more detailed information about how a consumer or worker will be assessed by an AI tool, as well as actionable post-decision explanations.\n\nCR published an AI policy guide in March that outlines our key positions and recommendations for policymakers.", "source": {"uri": "advocacy.consumerreports.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "CR Advocacy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Reports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance coverage in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://article.images.consumerreports.org/f_auto/prod/content/dam/special-graphics/CR-generic-lowres", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Yet for artificial intelligence - one of the UK's highest growth industries - investments risk being held back by a lack of alignment between the Government and the competition regulator.\n\nWhile the UK has sought to position itself as the leading AI hub in Europe, the Competition and Markets Authority has decided to focus on risks rather than the opportunities of AI. Until this disconnect is addressed, the UK risks losing its edge in the field.\n\nAt present, the UK is home to the most AI firms in Europe, totalling over 1,680, according to the Global AI Ecosystem database, with the total value of the sector expected to reach $1 trillion globally by 2035. These companies are already making important advancements, notably in healthcare, where AI is streamlining complex ultrasound measurements to diagnose heart conditions and enabling earlier detection of cancer. As a result, the UK is well positioned to be the European leader in a sector which is projected to reach $1 trillion in value by 2035.\n\nHowever, the small businesses that are championing AI innovation face major barriers to success. Crucially, they need vast amounts of investment to pay in-demand talent and buy vast amounts of 'compute capacity': thousands of servers with specialised chips that execute trillions of operations to power large language models. Therefore, AI firms are under immense pressure to scale and deploy their products at pace. Each company is, in essence, racing to deploy a commercially viable product before their funding runs out.\n\nAs a consequence, small AI businesses are almost entirely dependent on capital injections to manage both astronomical costs and major business challenges. And, so far, it has been the established tech companies that have stepped up, entering into partnerships with AI startups, to provide the backing that these innovators need.\n\nHowever, the CMA considers this support an area of 'increasing concern' due to supposed market concentration risks and is even going as far as to investigate whether non-controlling investments between separate non-British companies should be subject to scrutiny under the Enterprise Act.\n\nThis is alarming not only for investors in these smaller AI companies, but also for the innovators themselves. When a regulator steps in and challenges an investment, it does not just put one partnership at risk; it deters others. This begs the question as to whether the CMA is actually supporting AI innovation as it says it does.\n\nInvestors fundamentally look for markets where government and regulators are working toward a shared vision for the economy, without this they will rightly look elsewhere. The new government must now decide if they want the UK to lead the way in AI innovation, with all the economic growth and high-skilled jobs this involves.

Phil Murphy signed legislation into law July 25 establishing the Next New Jersey Program.\n\nThe initiative aims to attract new investment into the state's AI industry, providing up to $500 million in tax credits for AI businesses. The incentives were originally allocated for the Aspire and Emerge programs. Assembly Bill 4558/Senate Bill 3432 was passed alongside the Fiscal Year 2025 state budget as that process came down the home stretch.\n\nThe Thursday signing ceremony took place at the Roseland headquarters of CoreWeave. Founded in a New Jersey suburban garage, the AI cloud infrastructure company has grown into a global company and leader in this space.\n\n\"We're here today to sign a piece of legislation that will empower our state's top minds to shape the future of generative artificial intelligence - both ambitiously and responsibly,\" said Murphy. \"Because in a moment when the future of this realm has yet to be written, we here in New Jersey can be one of its prime authors. And together, in partnership with our state's innovators, researchers and industry leaders like CoreWeave - we can unleash a new generation of possibilities that will transform our world for the better.\"\n\nCoreWeave co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Brian Venturo thanked Murphy and his administration for their leadership and investment in the AI space. He stressed this legislation will position New Jersey as a premiere hub for AI innovation.\n\n\"Governor, your presence here today is not only a testament to your commitment to the advancement of technology, but also your unwavering support for the AI business community in our state,\" said Venturo. \"Your dedication to fostering an environment where companies like ours can thrive has not gone unnoticed. We are grateful for your leadership and vision.\"\n\nVenturo said the bill signing is definitive proof that New Jersey is open for AI business.\n\n\"This not only reinforces New Jersey's heritage as a state of innovators but also paves the way for significant advancements and opportunities for AI development,\" said Venturo. \"As the AI Hyperscaler, CoreWeave is proud to be headquartered here and excited to continue driving this industry forward.\"\n\nPrimary sponsors of the legislation Sen. Raj Mukherji, D-32nd District, and Assemblyman Chris Tully, D-38th District, were on hand for the event.\n\n\"From life-saving health care breakthroughs to traffic jams, artificial intelligence will touch every aspect of our daily lives,\" said Mukherji, a former information technology CEO. \"Through the responsible incentives in the Next New Jersey legislation, we are cementing New Jersey's place at the forefront of technological advancement and economic competitiveness as we tap into the transformative potential of AI.\"\n\n\"The Next New Jersey Program is a bold step forward in making our state a leading hub for the rapidly evolving AI industry and ensure we continue building a prosperous and innovative future all of New Jersey,\" said Tully. \"New Jersey's investment lets industry know our state is a competitive and committed leader in AI.\"\n\n\"The bill I'm signing today - and again I want to thank Raj and Chris and their colleagues - will invest up to $500 million into building out New Jersey's AI infrastructure. $500 million,\" said Murphy, who also credited the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and its leadership for their efforts in shaping the legislation.\n\n\"And with this investment, we're going to make it far easier for our state's students, researchers, entrepreneurs - you name it, who share our commitment to innovating responsibly to explore the potential of their AI-powered innovations,\" Murphy said. \"We want our state government to be a catalyst for pairing together established players in the world of AI like CoreWeave, with young innovators who are just getting their start.\"\n\nMurphy said the legislation reflects the state's continued efforts and big bets into AI and innovation. He pointed to the establishment of the AI Task Force and the AI Hub at Princeton, as well as innovation hubs such as HAX, SciTech Scity and more.\n\n\"Let me be clear, CoreWeave is one of the hottest companies on the planet. Their reach is hyperglobal,\" said Murphy. \"They could have planted their headquarters flag anywhere, literally - and they chose the great State of New Jersey.\"\n\n\"What a momentous day,\" said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. \"This is a continuation of our journey to making New Jersey the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem America - and recapturing our leadership position in innovation and entrepreneurship.\"\n\nSullivan spoke about the potential scale of AI. He analogized it to the early internet, referencing recent comments from Microsoft's Brad Smith at the AI Summit comparing the technology to the printing press.\n\n\"I am big with these metaphors. I think you can't miss for what generative AI represents for the future our society; of our economy; of our state; and of our country and our world,\" said Sullivan. \"And so, this bill that the governor is going to sign, I think, really positions New Jersey to make smart and targeted investment to support not just the AI industry - but all of New Jersey's economic competitiveness. Because being on our front foot with regard to generative AI is going to be like 20-25 years ago thinking - we should probably have a good internet infrastructure; and companies should have websites - those kinds of innovative ideas.\"\n\nMurphy closed his comments by saying it is important to look in the mirror and ask: who are you, who are you not, and what can you be and what can you not be?\n\n\"I've said this many times - I'm going to die, probably, trying to make cars and trucks again in New Jersey. But when I look in the mirror, I don't see that,\" said Murphy. \"What I do see is an innovation economy. I see with proof points up and down our state - biopharma, life sciences, tech, telecom, film/television, digital, the green economy, offshore wind, fintech, the guts of the sports betting business. That's who we are. We lead with talent; we lead with innovation; we lead with our location.\"\n\nHe said that his administration decided early, collectively and affirmatively to make an all-in bet on generative AI.\n\n\"The creation of this program will support the growth of AI-related businesses, which could lead to scientific breakthroughs and lifesaving discoveries right in our backyard,\" said Murphy. \"AI will be a transformative industry that will change lives and grow our economy - and New Jersey is ready to take the lead.\"", "source": {"uri": "njbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJBIZ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_fazelpoor@njbiz.com", "name": "Matthew Fazelpoor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raj_Mukherji", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raj Mukherji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Tully", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Tully"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Economic_Development_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Economic Development Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Smith_(American_lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Smith (American lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Printing press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Summit, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://njbiz.com/files/2024/07/Murphy_CoreWeave-AI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 159, "textEnd": 166}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Also in attendance: a whole lot of AI.\n\nFrom the broadcasts to security, AI is being infused heavily throughout the Paris games. It's not exactly surprising in this moment when AI is dominating, but what is interesting is the extent to which AI's presence at the Olympics provides a snapshot of how broadly AI is quickly being implemented in so many different areas from live events to broadcast, advertising, athlete performance, law enforcement, and state surveillance.\n\nOverall the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it's determined over 180 potential use cases for AI in the Olympics, some of which will be on display this summer. AI tools will also assist athletes with analyzing sporting performance and will additionally be deployed to \"enhance the fairness and accuracy of judging and refereeing through the provision of precise metrics,\" according to IOC. Beyond the competitions themselves, some of the ways AI is being used at the Olympics seem like nothing more than marketing gimmicks, while others show how the technology could change how we interact with events and content. Then there's the more controversial use case of surveillance that has privacy and civil liberty advocates sounding the alarm.\n\nLast week, it was announced that Google has been named \"the official search AI partner of Team USA,\" marking the first time the sports organization has partnered with a tech company. Commentators with NBCUniversal -- which continues to hold exclusive American media rights to the games -- will use Google's new AI search overviews to answer questions about the sports on-air. NBC has also recruited Comedian Leslie Jones to serve as \"Chief Superfan Commentator,\" a role that seemingly mixes entertaining fans with showing off how Google's Gemini assistant works.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee put out a statement hyping up the Google collaboration as a \"powerful alliance that brings together the best of technology and sports\" that will \"inspire millions.\" Even without the grandiose language, it seems like a huge stretch. Does anyone really want to watch sports commentators Google live on the air? I would bet no, but clearly, this is serving more as an ad for Google's AI than a good use of the technology. There's a reason Google struck this first-of-its-kind deal, likely paying a pretty penny. (Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.)\n\nAs we know, these models are still prone to making up and delivering false information. There's a high chance the answers Gemini delivers will be less accurate than if the broadcast team researched the questions themselves. The same goes for the chatbot, powered by Intel, the IOC is rolling out for participating athletes to ask frequently asked questions regarding guidelines and procedures.\n\nPrior to this Google deal, however, NBCUniversal announced a brand new way for fans to watch Olympic content that could actually enhance the experience and simply wouldn't be possible without generative AI. The new feature, called Your Daily Olympic Recap, will provide users with personalized recaps of their favorite events complete with commentary provided by an AI version of legendary sportscaster Al Michaels's voice. Users can set up their preferences and then receive a personalized recap every day of the Olympics through the Peacock app, NBC's streaming platform that will also be airing the games.\n\nTo create the recaps, the language model behind the feature will analyze subtitles and metadata from NBC's Olympic coverage to create summaries of the events. It will then rewrite those summaries in Michaels's style before feeding them into a text-to-voice model. With so many different events happening simultaneously, the Olympics is not exactly easy to keep up with. Your Daily Olympic Recap actually solves a problem by compiling the parts you're most interested in and wrapping them up in a neat package. Using Michael's voice is the perfect bow on top, providing that legendary commentary sports fans have grown to love and expect. Time will tell if this feature works as planned, but NBC gets credit for using AI in an interesting way that actually solves a problem, rather than AI for AI's sake.\n\nEvent organizers and the French government are also leaning on AI to monitor potential threats. Specifically, AI-powered cameras will be used to track crowd movement and detect any activity considered unusual, from suspicious luggage to traffic violations. They'll also be collecting geolocation data and deploying camera-equipped drones. Earlier this year, the French government actually changed its laws in order to allow this use of the technology for the Olympics, passing Article 7 (a controversial provision that legalized AI-powered video surveillance before, during, and after the games) and Article 10 (which specifically permits the use of AI software to review video and camera feeds). While the technology technically isn't based on facial recognition, many have argued that Article 7 in particular violates GDPR, the EU's data privacy law which prohibits the processing of biometric data and gives citizens the right to have their personal data erased. It's also a tight line to walk in light of the newly enacted EU AI Act, which explicitly bans the use of live facial recognition systems by law enforcement.\n\nWhile acknowledging that such a large-scale event requires increased security, data privacy researchers and civil liberty advocates have raised concerns about giving the private technology companies involved access to thousands of cameras around France. The vague nature of how exactly the technology will be used also raises questions about what activity counts as unusual or suspicious and thus is subjected to increased surveillance, as well as how the data will be stored -- and potentially used in the future. While the French Government changed the law specifically for the Olympics, the provision allows for usage of the technology far beyond the end of the games.\n\nAnne Toomey McKenna, a law professor and attorney focused on the intersection of privacy, AI, and surveillance, argued in The Conversation that the French government and private tech sector are harnessing the legitimate need for increased security as grounds to deploy advanced surveillance and data gathering tools.\n\n\"Flagging these events seems like a logical and sensible use of technology. But the real privacy and legal questions flow from how these systems function and are being used,\" she wrote. \"How much and what types of data have to be collected and analyzed to flag these events? What are the systems' training data, error rates and evidence of bias or inaccuracy? What is done with the data after it is collected, and who has access to it? There's little in the way of transparency to answer these questions.\"\n\nMistral unveils its next-generation flagship model. That's according to VentureBeat. The day after Meta announced Llama 3.1 to challenge the closed frontier models from companies like OpenAI and Google, French AI startup Mistral followed suit with its own partially open new release. Called Mistral Large 2, the company says it's significantly more capable in code generation, mathematics, and reasoning than its predecessor and also offers much stronger multilingual support. The model contains 123 billion parameters, and while that's much fewer than Llama 3.1's 405 billion, Mistral says the model can run on a single H100 node. As my Eye on AI coauthor Jersey Kahn wrote on Tuesday, Llama 3.1's gargantuan size comes with some hefty challenges around the number of GPUs required to run the model and the expertise needed to manage such a distributed workload. When it comes to the Mistral Large 2's openness, however, it only stretches as far as noncommercial uses. For commercial applications, companies must obtain a separate license and usage agreement from Mistral.\n\nMicrosoft launches generative AI search results for Bing. That's according to TechCrunch. Much like Google's generative AI-powered search, Bing will now share summaries in response to users' search inquiries, created by AI from sources across the web. Bing says it will cite and link to the pages where the information stems from. The new search experience is currently only available to a small percentage of users. In its initial days, Google's generative AI search infamously suggested to users that they eat rocks and put glue on pizza, so we'll see how this goes.\n\nDeepfakes of Kamala Harris are going viral. Media Matters said fake audio of Harris started spreading like wildfire following President Joe Biden's announcement that he won't seek reelection and the subsequent wave of support for Harris as the Democratic nominee. The audio falsely depicts Harris sounding incoherent and slurring and was manipulated from a speech she gave at Howard University last year. Media Matters found that right-wing accounts are pushing the audio and that users have wrongly attributed it to Harris in order to attack her. TikTok has since removed the audio, but Mashable reports it's spread on Elon Musk's X as well. While the audio appears to be manipulated rather than generated by AI, the rise of widely available AI tools has made false depictions of political figures a top-of-mind issue. In May, a Senate committee passed three bills aimed at protecting elections from AI-generated deepfakes, but they have not advanced to become law.\n\nOpenAI may be on track to lose $5 billion this year and may need additional funding within 12 months. That's according to an analysis performed by The Information based on OpenAI financial figures it said it obtained and unnamed sources it said were familiar with the company's finances and spending. This would be a burn rate so high that the company, which received a $10 billion cash injection from Microsoft in 2023, would have to seek additional funding soon -- probably within the next year -- despite reportedly also being on course to make more than $2 billion in revenue this year. The publication's analysis, however, is based on a number of extrapolations, estimates, and assumptions about how much OpenAI is spending to rent data center capacity from Microsoft Azure, as well as how quickly the cost of training OpenAI's latest frontier models is ramping up. Those assumptions might not be correct. But if they are even in the ballpark, they point to a business that is nowhere close to becoming profitable. The publication pointed out that OpenAI may be in better shape than its rival Anthropic, which may be losing about half as much money but on a much lower revenue base.\n\nA day after raising $500 million, AI startup Cohere told staff it was laying off about 20 employees -- by Sharon Goldman\n\nGM-owned Cruise has lost interest in cars without steering wheels.

Using IronClad's software, the company has tagged and indexed over 4,000 contracts, generated net-new contract language, and was able to more easily cover for a colleague out on parental leave. Overall, Ironclad said 75% of its customers are now using its AI features to negotiate contracts, tag and index contracts, and surface insights.\n\nThe legal industry has been quick to pursue ways to benefit from new generative AI technologies, and tackling the tedious and repetitive nature of contracts has been of particular interest.

It identifies significant weaknesses in the UK's tech infrastructure that threaten the predicted potential gains - for people, society, and the economy - from the AI boom. It also outlines the ODI's recommendations for creating diverse, fair data-centric AI.\n\nBased on its research, the ODI is calling for the new government to take five actions that will allow the UK to benefit from the opportunities presented by AI while mitigating potential harms:\n\nThe ODI's white paper argues that the potential for emerging AI technologies to transform industries such as diagnostics and personalised education shows great promise. Yet significant challenges and risks are attached to widescale adoption, including - in the case of generative AI - reliance on a handful of machine learning datasets that ODI research has shown lack robust governance frameworks. This poses significant risks to both adoption and deployment, as inadequate data governance can lead to biases and unethical practices, undermining the trust and reliability of AI applications in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, and public services. These risks are exacerbated by a lack of transparency that is hampering efforts to address biases, remove harmful content, and ensure compliance with legal standards. To provide a clearer picture of how data transparency varies across different types of system providers, the ODI is developing a new 'AI data transparency index.'\n\nIf the UK is to benefit from the extraordinary opportunities presented by AI, the government must look beyond the hype and attend to the fundamentals of a robust data ecosystem built on sound governance and ethical foundations. We must build a trustworthy data infrastructure for AI because the feedstock of high-quality AI is high-quality data. The UK has the opportunity to build better data governance systems for AI that ensure we are best placed to take advantage of technological innovations and create economic and social value whilst guarding against potential risks.\n\nBefore the General Election, Labour's Manifesto outlined plans for a National Data Library to bring together existing research programmes and help deliver data-enabled public services. However, the ODI says that first, we need to ensure the data is AI-ready. As well as being accessible and trustworthy, data must meet agreed standards, which require a data assurance and quality assessment infrastructure. The ODI's recent research has found that currently - with a few exceptions - AI training datasets typically lack robust governance measures throughout the AI life cycle, posing safety, security, trust, and ethical challenges related to data protection and fair labour practices. Issues that needs to be addressed if the government is to make good on its plans.\n\nOther insights from the ODI's research include:", "source": {"uri": "channelx.world", "dataType": "news", "title": "ChannelX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_dawson@channelx.world", "name": "Chris Dawson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_boom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI boom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White paper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://channelx.world/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fundamental-issues-threaten-the-AI-boom-says-ODI-shutterstock_2465096659.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

While AI has already begun to revolutionise aspects like trend forecasting, personalised recommendations, and supply chain efficiency, its potential within the creative heart of the industry -- design itself -- remains largely untapped. Some might fear AI replacing human artistry, but many see it as a powerful tool to augment creativity, allowing designers to explore new possibilities and push boundaries. This presents a unique opportunity for Asia's culturally-rich fashion scene to embrace AI and unlock a new era of innovation and expression.\n\nWhile AI can analyse existing data, it cannot truly have the inherent desire to \"wonder\" or question assumptions in the way humans do. AI struggles to grasp the nuances of human social interactions and cultural contexts, and cannot fully comprehend and respond to the emotional complexities that drive human creativity. This limits AI's ability to create fashion that moves people and resonates with human emotions and experiences. Instead of seeing AI as a threat, designers can view it as a powerful collaborator, freeing them from tedious tasks and allowing them to focus on the artistic aspects of their work.\n\nAsia's existing robust supply chain infrastructure, together with the up-and-coming boom in AI-related infrastructure such as data centres, will provide a solid foundation for integrating AI-powered solutions. AI will help build a seamless flow from design to production, such as creating realistic 3D models of garments, allowing for virtual fitting and adjustments, by taking a single clothing image and accurately reflecting how it would drape, fold, cling, stretch, and form wrinkles and shadows on a diverse set of real models in various poses.\n\nImplementing AI in the fashion industry requires a deep understanding of both fashion and artificial intelligence technologies. Skilled professionals are needed to develop, deploy, and maintain AI algorithms and systems tailored to the specific needs of the fashion sector.\n\nIt is prime time for fashion companies to jump on the bandwagon of innovation, as tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are making a big push to invest and expand in Southeast Asia, which is home to 700 million people and whose economies are collectively worth over US$3.8 trillion. This shows that Asian countries are accelerating in attracting and nurturing AI talents. Coupled with the fact that Asia's \"Generation AI\" (those who have grown up with the technology), compared to other regions, is more ready than ever to learn and adopt new technologies, educators should leverage this opportune timing to prime the AI-ready workforce, and simultaneously foster closer collaboration between tech companies, brands, and academic institutions.\n\nEducators are crucial in fostering partnerships between tech companies, our own respective industry brands, and academic institutions. While Asia has significant investments in technology, there's a need for more focused R&D and education in AI specifically tailored to the fashion industry. We are already integrating AI into our curriculum through hands-on experiences like fabric pattern design and creating virtual fashion models, but a collaborative effort is still important because the process of developing proprietary AI tools that address the unique challenges and opportunities in Asian fashion requires wide partnership and devotion. By actively engaging with AI, we are in fact encouraging a more creative and responsible use of technology, preparing our future workforce for the AI era.\n\nThe most crucial thing to remember is that humans remain the ultimate decision-makers. AI-powered workflows serve as powerful tools that augment human intuition and creativity, allowing designers and manufacturers to make more informed and impactful decisions. AI-powered manufacturing processes free up human hands from repetitive tasks, allowing designers and craftspeople to focus their energy on the creative and strategic aspects of their work. By automating tasks like pattern cutting, fabric manipulation, and assembly, AI empowers humans to delve deeper into the realm of design concepts, material exploration, and innovative techniques. This shift from manual labour to creative thinking fosters a more fulfilling and impactful experience for those working in the fashion industry.\n\nAn example of the creative possibility could be tech-powered fashion crossovers showcasing Asia's diverse cultures. From the intricate silk saris of India to the flowing Hanfu of China, the region boasts a wealth of traditional garments with distinct styles, fabrics, and embroidery, inspiring contemporary designers to constantly reinterpret these traditional elements or blend them with modern trends to create exciting new aesthetics. Just as a Saudi designer has referenced traditional attire and invented his own futuristic style, Asia's deep and broad cultural pot presents a plethora of possibilities for bringing heritage into the future, waiting to be explored with AI. AI's role becomes evident in style transfers in these cross-cultural collaborations. Conveying the essence of one style onto another using AI, designers can create hybrid garments that blend elements from different cultures while promoting collaboration within the industry.\n\nThe influx of AI-powered solutions in fashion presents a unique opportunity for upskilling and reskilling existing workers. By investing in training programs that bridge the gap between traditional fashion expertise and AI knowledge, companies can empower their existing workforce to adapt to the changing landscape. This can involve training designers in AI-assisted design tools, teaching manufacturing workers to operate and maintain AI-powered machinery, and equipping sales and marketing professionals with data analysis and AI-driven personalization skills.\n\nThe future of fashion in Asia is bright, powered by the unique synergy of cultural inspiration, technological prowess, and a growing pool of talented creatives, yet it also requires fertile ground for us to see their fruition, including AI-savvy industry innovators and infrastructure support. By embracing AI, Asia's fashion industry can unlock a new era of innovation, where traditional aesthetics meet modern technology, and where designers push the boundaries of creativity. Through collaborative effort with fashion schools taking the lead to unite industry stakeholders, Asia's fashion creatives can flourish, not just by adapting to AI, but by shaping its future.", "source": {"uri": "fashionunited.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FashionUnited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_modeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3D modeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social relation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanfu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanfu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sari"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manual labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://fashionunited.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=contain,format=jpeg,gravity=center,height=630,quality=70,width=1200/https://fashionunited.com/img/upload/2024/07/25/appendix-1-vw6i3akd-2024-07-25.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Legendary computer scientist Alan Turing proposed an \"imitation game\" to help people differentiate computers from humans in an attempt to answer questions about machines' ability to think.\n\nA new rush for AI models that can perform tasks and comprehend as well as humans, commonly referred to as artificial general intelligence, has picked up inside private labs and governments' research sites in nations around the world.\n\nJohn Beieler, the chief AI officer in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said in an interview with The Washington Times that no one is close yet to producing artificial general intelligence, or AGI, but that even measuring whether anyone is capable of such an accomplishment is difficult.\n\n\"It seems like we've blown past things like the Turing Test quietly and things that were the bar for sentient AI,\" Mr. Beieler said. \"We've kind of crossed that, but of course, I don't think anyone really thinks that the computers are sentient right now.\"\n\nChina wants artificial general intelligence. The country published an AI development plan in 2017 touting the advantage of \"brain-like intelligence\" for AI, according to an English-language translation of the plan.\n\nChinese researchers aim to merge AI and neuroscience in pursuit of artificial general intelligence, according to a Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology report from July 2023. The report said China views brain-inspired AI as the path to general AI.\n\nAmerican tech dynamo OpenAI is planning for AGI, too. In 2023, the company outlined its vision for AGI to \"give everyone incredible new capabilities,\" but cautioned that \"drastic accidents and societal disruption\" could ensue from AGI misuse as well.\n\nThe American intelligence community wants to ensure the worst outcomes do not result from such powerful models' deployment, according to Mr. Beieler, chief AI officer at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\"We don't have a really good, consistent way of measuring the performance of models across the board,\" he said.\n\nMr. Beieler said some models show proficiency at coding but struggle with answering questions, while other models may demonstrate an inverse skill.\n\nOpenAI, for example, said in March 2023 its GPT-4 model scored in the 88th percentile for the law school admissions test, up from the 40th percentile achieved by its earlier GPT-3.5 model. When it came to the Graduate Record Examination's writing test, however, the newer model performed roughly the same as the earlier model.\n\nAI models' non-linear results suggest that it is difficult to determine what the models will do next.\n\nMr. Beieler said there needs to be a \"much more robust\" academic and research and development effort aimed at characterizing models so the intelligence community can better understand which models to deploy, pursue, and fine-tune.\n\n\"The intelligence community, we're a little bit paranoid by nature, so we of course consider all the downsides to this technology both from our own deployment. ... But [we are] also very cognizant of ways that our adversaries could use these sorts of technologies,\" Mr. Beieler said.\n\nHe said the intelligence community is paying close attention to the problems of models' \"hallucinations,\" or generating false answers, and the intelligence agencies are looking at ways adversaries exploring the convergence of AI tech with biotechnology and agriculture.\n\nForecasting the future of AI is likely a fool's errand, but concerns about unpredictable advances and questions about the tech growing increasingly self-aware are motivating the industry's top minds.\n\nTech mogul Elon Musk said in April that the total amount of \"sentient compute of AI\" will probably exceed all humans in five years.\n\n\"My guess is that we'll have AI that is smarter than any one human probably around the end of next year,\" Mr. Musk said in a live-streamed interview on his social platform X.\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever quit the company earlier this year and is building a new team called \"Safe Superintelligence Inc.\" Prior to his departure, Mr. Sutskever warned of AI systems going rogue, ignoring the commands of their creators and sparking the extinction of humans.\n\nRegarding the question of whether AI is capable of perception and feelings, Mr. Beieler said he has not given it much thought. He said he knows plenty of people are working on answering such questions but he has not seen evidence to suggest the AI field is headed toward sentience.\n\nMr. Beieler said the U.S. intelligence community views AI advances as presenting more of an opportunity than a threat.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In recent weeks, several Chinese companies have unveiled AI technologies that rival leading American systems. And these technologies are already in the hands of consumers, businesses and independent software developers across the globe.At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai this month, startup founder Qu Dongqi showed off a video he had recently posted online. It displayed an old photograph of a woman with two toddlers. Then the photo sprang to life as the woman lifted the toddlers up in her arms and they laughed with surprise.\n\nThe video was created by AI technology from Chinese internet company Kuaishou. The technology was reminiscent of a video generator, called Sora, that American startup OpenAI unveiled this year. But unlike Sora, it was available to the general public.\n\n\"My American friends still can't use Sora,\" Qu said. \"But we already have better solutions here.\"\n\nWhile the United States has had a head start on AI development, China is catching up. In recent weeks, several Chinese companies have unveiled AI technologies that rival leading American systems. And these technologies are already in the hands of consumers, businesses and independent software developers across the globe.\n\nWhile many American companies are worried that AI technologies could accelerate the spread of disinformation or cause other serious harm, Chinese companies are more willing to release their technologies to consumers or even share the underlying software code with other businesses and software developers. This kind of sharing of computer code, called open source, allows others to more quickly build and distribute their own products using the same technologies.\n\nOpen source has been a cornerstone of the development of computer software, the internet and, now, artificial intelligence. The idea is that technology advances faster when its computer code is freely available for anyone to examine, use and improve upon.\n\nChina's efforts could have enormous implications as AI technology continues to develop in the years to come. The technology could increase the productivity of workers, fuel future innovations and power a new wave of military technologies, including autonomous weapons.\n\nWhen OpenAI kicked off the AI boom in late 2022 with the release of the online chatbot ChatGPT, China struggled to compete with technologies emerging from American companies such as OpenAI and Google. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems.) But China's progress is now accelerating.\n\nKuaishou released its video generator, Kling, in China more than a month ago and to users worldwide on Wednesday. Just before Kling's arrival, 01.AI, a startup co-founded by Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and technologist who helped build Chinese offices for both Google and Microsoft, released chatbot technology that scored nearly as well as the leading American technologies on common benchmark tests that rate the performance of the world's chatbots.\n\nNew technology from Chinese tech giant Alibaba has also leaped to the top of a leaderboard that rates open-source AI systems. \"We have disproved the commonplace belief that China doesn't have the talent or the technology to compete with the U.S.,\" Lee said. \"That belief is simply wrong.\"\n\nIn interviews, a dozen technologists and researchers at Chinese tech companies said open-source technologies were a key reason that China's AI development has advanced so quickly. They saw open-source AI as an opportunity for the country to take a lead.\n\nBut that will not be easy. The United States remains at the forefront of AI research. And U.S. officials have resolved to keep it that way.\n\nThe White House has instituted a trade embargo designed to prevent Chinese companies from using the most powerful versions of computer chips that are essential to building artificial intelligence. A group of lawmakers has introduced a bill that would make it easier for the White House to control the export of AI software built in the United States. Others are trying to limit the progress of open-source technologies that have helped fuel the rise of similar systems in China.\n\nThe top American companies are also exploring new technologies that aim to eclipse the powers of today's chatbots and video generators.\n\n\"Chinese companies are good at replicating and improving what the U.S. already has,\" said Yiran Chen, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke University in North Carolina. \"They are not as good at inventing something completely new that will bypass the U.S. in five to 10 years.\"\n\nBut many in China's tech industry believe that open-source technology could help them grow despite those constraints. And if U.S. regulators stifle the progress of American open-source projects (as some lawmakers are discussing) China could gain a significant edge. If the best open-source technologies come from China, U.S. developers could end up building their systems atop Chinese technologies.\n\n\"Open-source AI is the foundation of AI development,\" said Cl\u00e9ment Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, a company that houses many of the world's open-source AI projects. The U.S. built its leadership in AI through collaboration between companies and researchers, he said, \"and it looks like China could do the same thing.\"\n\nWhile anyone with a computer can change open-source software code, it takes a lot of data, skill and computing power to fundamentally alter an AI system. When it comes to AI, open source typically means that a system's building blocks serve as a foundation that allows others to build something new, said Fu Hongyu, director of AI governance at Alibaba's research institute, AliResearch.\n\nAs in other countries, in China there is an intense debate over whether the latest technological advances should be made accessible to anyone or kept as closely held company secrets. Some, including Robin Li, the CEO of Baidu, one of the few companies in China building its own AI technology entirely from scratch, think the technology is most profitable and secure in the hands of a limited few.\n\nAI systems require enormous resources: talent, data and computing power. Beijing has made it clear that the benefits accruing from such investments should be shared. The Chinese government has poured money into AI projects and subsidized resources like computing centers.\n\nBut Chinese tech companies face a major constraint on the development of their AI systems: compliance with Beijing's strict censorship regime, which extends to generative AI technologies.\n\nKuaishou's new video generator Kling appears to have been trained to follow the rules. Text prompts with any mention of China's president, Xi Jinping, or controversial topics such as feminism and the country's real estate crisis yielded error messages. An image prompt of this year's National People's Congress yielded a video of the delegates shifting in their seats.\n\nKuaishou did not respond to questions about what steps the company took to prevent Kling from creating harmful, fake or politically sensitive content.\n\nBy making their most advanced AI technologies freely available, China's tech giants are demonstrating their willingness to contribute to the country's overall technological advancement as Beijing has established that the power and profit of the tech industry should be channeled toward the goal of self sufficiency.\n\nThe concern for some in China is that the country will struggle to amass the computing chips it needs to build increasingly powerful technologies. But that has not yet prevented Chinese companies from building powerful new technologies that can compete with U.S. systems.\n\nAt the end of last year, Lee's company, 01.AI, was ridiculed on social media when someone discovered that the company had built its AI system using open-source technology originally built by Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram. Some saw it as a symbol of China's dependence on American ingenuity.\n\nSix months later, 01.AI unveiled a new version of its technology. It now sits near the top of the leaderboard that ranks the world's best technologies. Around the same time, a team from Stanford University in California unveiled Llama 3-V, claiming it outperformed other leading models. But a Chinese researcher soon noticed that the model was based on an open-source system originally built in China.\n\nIt was the reverse of the controversy surrounding 01.AI last year: Rather than Chinese developers building atop American technology, U.S. developers built atop Chinese technology.\n\nIf regulators limit open-source projects in the United States and Chinese open-source technologies become the gold standard, Delangue said, this kind of thing could become the norm.\n\n\"If the trend continues, it becomes more and more of a challenge for the U.S.,\" he said.",

Can I livestream the opening ceremony? Will there be a computer refereeing my games? Where can I get freebies from sponsors?\n\nThese are just some of the questions that athletes will be able to ask AthleteGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot designed for them, accessible through the Athlete365 mobile app. It'll be able to scour through \"thousands of information pages very quickly, and be available 24/7 to answer questions\", says Todd Harple, the Olympics AI Innovation programme lead at Intel Labs in Hillsboro, Oregon, who is involved with the effort.\n\nThe chatbot -- a large language model (LLM) built using an AI developed by Paris-based company Mistral AI and Intel's Gaudi processors -- is just one way in which AI is leaving its imprint on this year's Olympics, which begin on 26 July. Few would have been familiar with LLMs or heard of ChatGPT during the last summer games in Tokyo in 2021. But sprinters in Paris can only hope to match the strides that AI technologies have made since.\n\nThe International Olympics Committee (IOC) is embracing the technology. In April, it rolled out its AI agenda -- an effort to streamline the explosive growth of AI research in sport and to strategize its use in the Olympics. \"We have to be leaders of change, and not the object of change,\" said Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC in Lausanne, Switzerland, at a press event in London, which showcased the capabilities of various AI sports tools.\n\nNature explores three ways in which AI is changing how athletes and spectators will experience the Olympic Games.\n\nAs early as 1900, when Paris first hosted the Olympic Games, French scientist \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey was pioneering the use of technology to study athletes in motion. His high-speed chronophotography -- which involved rigging a camera like a machine gun, feeding it photographic plates like ammunition to rapidly capture frames -- snapped sprinters and long-jumpers. He analysed the body's biomechanics to \"discover the secret of superiority of certain athletes\", a Nature editorial commented in 1901.\n\nToday, it is possible to do much more just by recording with a smartphone. Intel's 3D athlete tracking (3DAT) technology uses AI to track 21 points across the human body to render its precise physical movement, providing \"all the biomechanical insights that coaches look for\" in elite athletes, Harple says. He thinks that such technologies will lead to closer competition and new records.\n\nThe ways in which AI is being used to enhance athletes' performance range from designing custom-built athletic shoes and clothing to determining optimum nutrition and training schedules. \"It may even accelerate our discovery of new strategies of playing sports,\" he says. A historic example of such a fundamental change is the Fosbury flop -- now the dominant style of high jump pioneered by US athlete Dick Fosbury at the 1968 Olympics.\n\nThe ease of collecting individual data, combined with AI analysis, could also help coaches to identify talent, making sports more equitable. In March, the IOC piloted a scouting programme that used 3DAT to identify more than 40 children in Senegal who showed promise in becoming Olympic athletes, by analysing simplerills such as running and jumping.\n\nBut sports and nations with big professional leagues will retain a big advantage, because they have the resources to gather high-quality data, and to train algorithms with them. \"The problem with some of the Olympic sports is that there is not a big footprint of data,\" says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist at the sports-technology company Stats Perform in Chicago, Illinois. This extends how the technology can be used in other aspects of these games, such as judging and officiating.\n\nOlympics water polo referee Frank Ohme is no stranger to AI. His day job as an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, involves hunting for signals of colliding black holes -- sometimes with AI's help -- in noisy gravitational-wave data. But when he dons the all-white referee uniform in Paris, he'll need to peer through splashing water waves to decide whether the ball has crossed the line into the goal.\n\nAI is already informing such decisions in sports such as football, using information recorded by an array of cameras around the stadium and chips implanted in the ball. But other sports are yet to catch on -- and AI will probably be slower to pervade areas such as refereeing, which require real-time data analysis.\n\nAnother hurdle is funding, and the specific needs of each sport -- there will be 32 events at the Paris games. Despite water polo being the oldest Olympic team sport, there's not nearly as much money in it as there is in basketball or football, says Ohme. Using AI in water polo would also present different challenges, such as training algorithms on images taken underwater and in chaotic scenarios, he adds.\n\nPrecise and open communication is key whenever AI assistance is used to make calls in real-time. \"The easiest way to convince teams and spectators is to give them all the information through an image or visualization where they can determine [the call] themselves,\" Ohme says.\n\nIt's also hard to remove ambiguity in actions such as fouls in contact sports. These are split-second decisions that not even all humans can agree on. \"I wouldn't even know how to start putting those into numbers,\" says Ohme, who thinks that detecting black holes is an easier task for AI in comparison.\n\nThe torrents of data collected during the games will not only feed AI algorithms, but also television viewers hungry for statistics. \"Sport is its own language. It crosses barriers to help everyone communicate,\" Lucey says. Statistics and numbers enrich these conversations by providing extra benchmarks for comparison. \"Of course people want that,\" he adds.\n\nBroadcasters are rushing to find ways to augment this new wealth of information and put it onto television screens. Viewers were enthralled when the virtual world-record line was superimposed onto the screen for television viewers during the Sydney 2000 games. In 2024, broadcasters have the ability to display much more, such as acceleration, top speeds and stride lengths, says Harple.\n\nWhat excites Harple most is the prospect of personalized highlights made available to viewers through Intel's Geti computer-vision AI platform, which could be a feature of future broadcasts. With so much sporting action being recorded simultaneously, Harple says that the ability of AI to pick out exactly what viewers want to see will be a game-changer. This could be particularly beneficial for coaches and broadcasters from nations that have more limited access to production resources. \"If someone wants every three-point shot made by the Nigerian men's basketball team, AI can go through all the footage and automatically put them together,\" he says.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [],

As this powerful technology advances, people are grappling with the unknown, unsure of what's real and what's mere hype.\n\nSensationalized headlines and exaggerated claims have fueled anxiety about malicious actors' misuse of AI while raising questions about the effectiveness of AI-powered defense solutions. Business leaders need to separate fact from fiction to understand how cybercriminals are really using AI and examine legitimate AI-powered cybersecurity defenses that provide greater protection based on their cost.\n\nAI has introduced a new level of sophistication and complexity to the threat landscape. Cybercriminals leverage AI to enhance their attack capabilities, making it easier and more efficient to breach networks and steal valuable data. Understanding how AI is being used in attacks indicates how defenders must leverage AI in response.\n\nCybercriminals use AI to find network vulnerabilities more efficiently and effectively and maximize profits. It's used to make social engineering more realistic and practical, classifying target data and identifying the most valuable and vulnerable information to steal. AI significantly lowers the technical barriers to cybercrime, making it much more efficient to identify and exploit paths into well-defended networks and steal the most valuable and liquid information for conversion into cash.\n\nRelated:11 Ways Cybersecurity Threats are Evolving\n\nOne of the most significant ways threat actors exploit AI is in social engineering. They exploit human psychology and vulnerabilities like trust, fear, and authority. Generative AI models like ChatGPT can produce highly convincing phishing emails and websites, mimicking legitimate individuals' or organizations' communication styles and tones.\n\nDeepfake technology powered by AI can create fake videos or audio recordings that impersonate real people, tricking victims into revealing sensitive information. Somewhere between 70% and 90% of successful cyberattacks leverage social engineering. A recent study by Proofpoint revealed that AI-generated phishing emails had a success rate of over 60%, compared to just 3% for traditional phishing attempts.\n\nAI is also being used to develop more evasive and sophisticated malware strains. By analyzing defensive responses and iteratively evolving their approach, cybercriminals can create malware that constantly mutates its code and behavior, making it harder for traditional signature-based antivirus software to detect. In one high-profile case, the Emotet banking trojan used AI to evade detection and spread to over 1.6 million systems across 194 countries.\n\nRelated:Law Enforcement Eyes AI for Investigations and Analysis\n\nAI is also used for adversarial attacks, automating, and expanding various attack vectors with minimal human effort. Password cracking, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation can be accelerated and amplified, allowing attackers to launch more frequently and on a larger scale. AI can also analyze massive amounts of data and identify potential targets or entry points, making attack prioritization more efficient.\n\nOne of the cybercriminals' most insidious applications of AI is data and intellectual property theft. AI algorithms can sift through vast amounts of data and identify valuable intellectual property, trade secrets, or sensitive information. This enables cybercriminals to prioritize and exfiltrate only the most valuable assets that cause organizations the most significant financial and competitive damage.\n\nTo counter these threats, organizations must adopt AI-powered cybersecurity solutions that can match or exceed the capabilities of their adversaries. AI-driven email and web security solutions can analyze content, sender behavior, and software characteristics to identify and block phishing attempts and malware more effectively than traditional signature-based methods. By continuously learning and adapting to new threats, these solutions can stay ahead of the curve, providing additional protection against ever-evolving attack vectors.\n\nRelated:Overcoming AI's 5 Biggest Roadblocks\n\nSome AI-powered endpoint protection solutions use deep learning technology to detect and respond to threats in real-time. Instead of relying on signatures, it adapts over time, learning what is and isn't normal endpoint behavior, enabling it to detect new threats and unknown attack methods.\n\nSecurity teams often are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of alerts, logs, and routine activities. AI offers the same increased efficiency to cybersecurity defense as it can the attackers. AI-powered solutions automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks like log monitoring, alert triage, patch management, and reporting, allowing cybersecurity professionals to focus on more critical and strategic functions while removing the risk of human error in detection activities. AI can streamline and optimize these processes, improving efficiency and reducing the risk of human error.\n\nAs cybercriminals continue to advance their tactics with AI, businesses must respond with AI-powered email and web security solutions.

I write about tech, payments, leadership and sustainability.\n\nAs the adoption of AI grows, so do conversations about the considerable amount of energy needed to power it. At face value, this seems to place AI at odds with sustainability for local and global technology safety regulations. One aspect of this conversation that hasn't been explored as widely, however, is how AI and sustainability can coexist and, in some cases, how AI can make industries more sustainable.\n\nThis is not to dismiss AI's extensive energy usage. Some scientists estimate that, based on the current rate of energy consumption by information and communications technology (ICT), ICTs will rise to account for 21% of the world's electricity consumption by 2030. Mitigating this will require businesses to make carbon-conscious AI and coding practices foundational and then implement them as soon as they begin testing and piloting any new AI use cases.\n\nAI's energy consumption needs are also shaped by how companies train their new models. Making energy preservation a priority at this stage will prevent the need to introduce sustainable practices into programming later, which will only further increase energy consumption and carbon emissions.\n\nHaving worked with banks, financial institutions and manufacturers to introduce sustainable practices into their digital initiatives for the past several decades, here are three ways we're now seeing them not only offset AI's energy usage but also create new sustainable processes as a result of new AI use cases.\n\nSome of the inefficiencies that manufacturing plants and factories experience are due to a lack of visibility into what's happening with their machines. To overcome this challenge, they are increasingly using AI to achieve 360-degree visibility in their factories -- allowing them to resolve issues, often before they happen. They can manage all of their operations from one place while decreasing energy inefficiencies characteristic of flawed machines and processes, leading to more quality and more sustainability.\n\nFor instance, we worked firsthand with an American multinational automobile manufacturer to introduce the large-scale, cloud-based data infrastructures it needs to use visual AI and machine learning algorithms across its manufacturing processes.\n\nOne immediate application of doing so is its ability to analyze images and data from machines to identify anomalies or defects in the manufacturing process. Once identified, they can quickly address interruptions that may have otherwise gone undetected until later. This added layer of foresight not only enables them to avoid operating defective machinery that would create an excessive amount of waste and carbon emissions, but it can also help prevent problems from happening altogether.\n\nAI is also helping power electric vehicles (EVs). An April 2024 report from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) revealed that EV efficiency improvements, such as improvements to batteries, need to be made. If they aren't, EVs are projected to put a large strain on the electric grid, with charging predicted to take up as much as 65% of today's total electricity demand by 2050.\n\nTo combat this and keep EVs a sustainable option, companies and researchers are using AI to optimize battery efficiency. For example, AI can adjust how a battery works to better match current needs -- changing charging speeds, determining how to distribute the remaining energy and maintaining temperatures for optimal battery health. With a longer energy life span, EVs can become more efficient and reduce waste.\n\nOne company already working toward this is Tesla. The automotive giant uses AI software systems to analyze where any battery malfunctions may occur, optimize performance and sustain health.\n\nIt's no secret that there's room for improved operations and precision in the oil and gas industry. It hasn't historically been synonymous with sustainability, but AI is beginning to change this.\n\nIn 2023, Halliburton demonstrated how AI can be used for sustainability in the oil and gas industry when it joined with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to launch an AI-enabled autonomous well control solution. Coined RoboWell, the system uses real-time data to monitor and adapt to constantly shifting dynamics in the oil field and optimize production based on current operating conditions.\n\nBy introducing autonomous wells that can self-adjust to maximize production, the two organizations have created a new model for making oil development and production more sustainable. The companies claimed that the project had already resulted in a 30% reduction in gas lift consumption and a 50% reduction in well movements.\n\nUsing AI-powered data analytics will enable companies across the board to delineate which prospective drilling spots will be the most productive. As a result, they'll decrease the number of drilling points, decreasing their environmental impact by decreasing pollution.\n\nIn the financial industry, organizations are under mounting pressure to balance their digital transformation initiatives with sustainable business practices.\n\nInvestment banks and private equity firms, for instance, need to be able to measure their portfolio companies' carbon footprints in a concrete way to report environmental impact to investors and regulators. Using AI, organizations can gather and analyze the data needed to measure businesses' carbon footprints more efficiently -- providing frequent and accurate analyses of how they're fairing.\n\nThe Carlyle Group leverages AI-gathered insights from natural language processing platform SESAMm to do just that. SESAMm's algorithms synthesize data points from billions of online sources -- social media, blogs, forums, customer reviews and more -- in over 100 languages to understand, among other things, companies' ESG risks. This unstructured data is then packaged into digestible reports that the Carlyle Group's deal teams use to more efficiently evaluate target companies and avoid investing in areas that are heading in the wrong direction.\n\nAs ESG practices increasingly factor into investors' decisions, the organization has been able to leverage AI to help clients make incredibly informed and sustainable investment decisions based on far more knowledge than its teams could possibly synthesize on their own.\n\nThe open partnership of private equity stakeholders uses this as a way to streamline the private investment industry's historically fragmented approach to collecting and reporting on ESG data, and its enhanced assessment of ESG trends enables investors to make more sustainable decisions.\n\nEach of these use cases can be adapted to help companies across industries become more sustainable at the present moment. Just as companies are looking to AI to increase their overall business efficiencies, they should also use it to find and address any functionalities that are using excess energy -- and then find more sustainable solutions.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Beyond the initial dopamine hit of using gen AI, people's patience for gimmicky displays is fading fast.\n\nSo, how does this apply to the AI darling of the hour, generative video? When the shock release of OpenAI's new video model Sora dropped a few months ago, LinkedIn was ablaze in conversation. But was it the first sign of the disruption? Hmm... not quite.\n\nEven these \"pure AI\" solutions, which look like silver bullets, still need human intervention.\n\nGenerative video models are probabilistic... non-deterministic..., and inherently random, which prevents them from reaching silver bullet status for creative applications. The complexity of training for consistency far surpasses that of static gen AI imagery, a fundamental limitation often overlooked. And no one hates inconsistency more than brand world builders.\n\nThis chaos, which undermines a creative vision, limits generative video to conveniently quirky music videos, retro movie trailers and novelty, sub-par TV spots - a reality that only sinks in when you realize that using tools like Midjourney feels like playing slots in Vegas - spinning again and again, waiting for the jackpot.\n\nWhen we look at our own creative department, it takes an average of four prompt attempts before we generate an image that aligns with a vision.\n\nTo mark the first birthday of our AI agency, faith, and help our friends in the industry, we set out to understand what it really takes to make something good. Could we define and master a complex workstream that could control this chaos as we have done for image and copy? Could we use gen AI to make a film that we wanted to make and not one that it wanted to make for us?\n\nWe'll let you decide.\n\nTo test this, we needed a rich brand world to provide the ecosystem for our experiment, so we chose our own. We decided to tell the faith origin story exactly the way we wanted to tell it, controlling AI to meet our creative standards instead of letting AI control how much we lowered them.\n\nWhen we launched faith we created a rich brand world, in the same way we would for our clients - made up of our brand characters, a girl and a robot - representing human and AI partnership. The story is based on our faith in how positivity in the face of great change can help us push past fear and allow for self-improvement. And while our short film, 'finding faith', tells the story of our protagonist's first encounter, the real story lies behind the scenes.\n\nAI tools are marketed as 'easy-to-use' or 'democratizing creativity', but to create usable brand assets that can leave the office, you need substantial technical fluency. We've seen that the more people use and explore the tools, the more sophisticated this usage gets. We've moved from unanimous list prompting to using natural language 93% of the time - building our fluency through practice.\n\nIf the first challenge was working out which tools could do what, the second was that a new update or release hours later made the previous redundant. The rate of improvement in tools is like nothing seen before, not only do you have to be agile, you have to be unprecious. We were both advantaged and disadvantaged by this; for example, tools like Elevenlabs' Text-to-SFX suddenly allowed us to add depth to a film with no dialogue, but the recent release of LivePortrait video generation left us questioning if we needed to start again!\n\nOne thing remained clear - there is no one magic, off-the-shelf tool that can produce branded video and those that claim to... always underwhelm. Our lean, agile creative team ended up combining over 15 tools to bring order to the chaos. We were able to animate backgrounds, transform 3D into 2D, turn photos into videos, and generate SFX by using tools including ChatGPT, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, Comfy UI, Viggle AI, ToonCrafter, AnimateDiff and Eleven Labs. But to achieve the best results, it's crucial to combine these with tools we use every day, like Unreal Engine, Blender, Adobe Creative Suite. It was this more targeted approach that gave us the flexibility and control required to bring our creative vision to life.\n\nTo answer the inevitable question about cost and efficiency, yes we cut production time in half and costs by around 85%. However, these metrics were not the primary drivers for making the film, as we're still in the early days of understanding the ROI of AI. We aren't saying one process replaces another. And we aren't saying AI is now ready to produce perfect branded content. What we are saying is that AI tools are just that - they are instruments, easy to pick up but hard to master; each producing melodies but together capable of producing symphony.\n\nIn terms of agencies' AI endeavors, there has been a lot of smoke and mirrors, leaning into the limitations of the tools, lowering creative standards, and altering messaging to cater to AI's shortcomings. This stems from a lack of experimentation with the tools - and it makes sense, as marketing teams don't have time to undergo R&D projects like this. The urgent displaces the important, and it is a privilege for us at faith to be able to dedicate resources to this.\n\nEncouraging adoption has really paid off for us in developing our own tools for clients and in VCCP's general use and understanding of AI. We've seen a 300% growth in usage of Midjourney alone across the business since December 2022 (with most in the last year).\n\nJust a year ago when a gen AI video of Will Smith eating noodles went viral. The medium has come a long way, as you can see.\n\nBut, to accelerate our industry's collective learning we are lifting the lid on the making of the project. Dissecting which tools we used and the challenges we have overcome.\n\nThis project has been invaluable in placing faith at the cutting edge of creating with AI; we are pushing the tools to their limits, honing our skills, and on a mission to use AI as a positive force that accelerates human creativity and imagination.", "source": {"uri": "thedrum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertisement_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertisement film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dopamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blender (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://thedrum-media.imgix.net//thedrum-prod/s3/opinion/353297/screenshot_2024-07-25_103238.png?w=1280&ar=default&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Let's dive into this phenomenon and explore its impact.\n\nWe've all been there. A new programming language gains traction, a cutting-edge framework promises to revolutionize development, or an innovative tool claims to boost productivity tenfold.\n\nIt's natural to feel excited about these advancements. After all, staying current is part of the job, but when does this pursuit of novelty become counterproductive?\n\nShiny Object Syndrome in tech isn't just about playing with new gadgets. It's a mindset that can affect your career trajectory, often leading you to invest time and energy in learning skills that may not align with your long-term goals, or your company's needs.\n\nTrends come and go at a dizzying pace. One month, everyone's talking about blockchain; the next, it's all about serverless architecture. As an employee, you can feel pressured to keep up with all the trends, fearing that you'll become obsolete if you don't.\n\nHowever, this constant shift in focus can be exhausting and counterproductive.\n\nInstead of developing deep expertise in areas that truly matter to your role and company, you might find yourself with a scattered skillset, jack of all trades but master of none.\n\nA more strategic approach would allow for deep expertise development, with a knowledge of tech trends layered on top. This can make your skillset more valuable in the long term.\n\nSpeaking of trends, let's talk about the elephant in the room: generative AI.\n\nWith tech giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft reporting record-breaking revenues due to the technology, gen AI has become the latest gold rush, and tech workers naturally feel the pressure to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nThe eye-watering salaries on offer are also pretty tempting.\n\nAccording to jobs site Indeed, the average salary potential for generative AI skills is $174,727, and these jobs are in such demand due to a widespread skills gap.\n\nWhile AI certainly holds plenty of potential, it's crucial to approach it thoughtfully. Not every role or company needs to pivot to AI immediately.\n\nThe rush to adopt AI can lead to missteps, even for established companies. Take the recent case of SheerLuxe, a luxury lifestyle platform in the UK that faced backlash for introducing an AI-generated \"editor\" named Reem.\n\nThis computer-generated image harmed the brand's entire offering of personalized recommendations, and was criticized for upholding unattainable beauty standards.\n\nMany more questioned why the company hired an agency to create an AI editor that looked to be Middle Eastern, instead of actually hiring a woman of color for the position.\n\nIn response to the controversy, SheerLuxe released a statement on Instagram explaining that Reem was created due to their desire to experiment with AI, stating that \"no jobs were compromised in any way as a result of her creation\". The whole company then took a duvet day.\n\nKhyati Sundaram, CEO of recruitment software Applied, offered valuable insights on the situation to HR Magazine:\n\n\"The reaction sparked by SheerLuxe's decision to introduce an AI employee highlights just how strongly people feel about unchecked or hastily rolled-out AI solutions.\"\n\n\"We all know that AI holds huge potential, but we also recognise that it stands to disrupt a wide range of sectors and roles. That means employers and companies have a responsibility to embrace AI mindfully and in a way that helps existing teams, rather than leaves them feeling threatened or replaced.\"\n\nThis stunt has raised questions about the thoughtful implementation of AI in various industries, and serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of rushing to adopt a technology, without considering all angles first.\n\nThe SheerLuxe controversy isn't an isolated incident either.\n\nIt followed closely on the heels of backlash against HR software company Lattice, which announced plans to allow AI agents to be treated equally to human employees on its platform, only to scrap the idea after feedback that said it \"disrespects the humanity of your real employees\".\n\nThese cases highlight the growing tension between rapid AI adoption and ethical considerations in the workplace.\n\nAvoiding Shiny Object Syndrome while still staying innovative is a challenge.\n\nWhen considering a new technology, invest time in thorough research. Understand its potential benefits, drawbacks, and ethical implications before considering if it aligns with your personal and company values and objectives.\n\nNext, engage your team in discussions about potential new technologies. Their insights can help identify which innovations are truly valuable and which might be distractions.\n\nStart with a small-scale, low-profile project if you do decide to adopt a new technology. Think of the opposite approach to Reem. Test the waters under the radar.\n\nAfter an allotted time period, evaluate its impact, and be prepared to abandon or pivot initiatives that aren't working.\n\nRemember, true innovation isn't about chasing every new trend.\n\nTaking time to pause and asking if a new technology is a valuable addition or an objectives distraction could be the difference between genuine progress, and a lot of wasted time.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Genius_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy Genius Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novelty song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Programming language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_rush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bandwagon effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phone connector (audio)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luxury goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elephant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ou.CTJa0ra6EjVD4con7IQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bgr_208/1fbf42ec62d993b9ac9557c8728228f6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The agenda establishes a governance and oversight framework to identify both the risks and positive potential associated with AI in sports. It will be deployed in several high-impact areas we outline below, from training to broadcasting.\n\nThe IOC's pioneering initiative is set to impact most aspects of the historic sporting event. Here are some ways that the Olympic Games are integrating AI into their operations.\n\nEven before athletes enter the arena, AI is being used to help them reach their potential. Specifically, trainers are using advanced AI algorithms to analyze athletes' techniques, improve their training regimes, and minimize injuries. In addition to cultivating more personalized training routines, and using data-powered insights, AI is also being used to simulate training companions.\n\nFor example, Indian table tennis player Sathiyan Gnanasekaran has previously trained with a table tennis robot promoted by the IOC, while other athletes have used hyperrealistic virtual reality software.\n\n\"It can generate speeds and spin on the ball which no humans can manage. As a result, my receiving ability has improved, and the flicks have also gotten better.\" - Table tennis player Sathiyan Gnanasekaran told The Times of India how an AI bot has improved his training\n\nWhile our brains respond slightly differently when training with AI companions, some experts, like Daniel Ferris, a Ph.D professor of biomedical engineering, claim that using the technology could actually \"be better than training against a human opponent\".\n\nWhile AI has been used to judge athletes in previous Games, the 2024 ceremony will utilize the technology to track performance even more closely. Since AI can be used to analyze capabilities too intricate for the human eye, the technology is expected to usher in a new era of judging accuracy.\n\nNo sport is adopting this strategy more than gymnastics. In 2023, the International Gymnastics Federation (IGF) employed a new Judging Support System (JSS) to capture the movements of gymnastics and evaluate them based on the sports rule book. After its success at the most recent world championships, the JSS will be making its debut at its first Olympic Games in France.\n\nLondon 2012 Olympic gymnast and Tech.co Managing Editor, Jennifer McIlveen, has been impressed by the development of Fujitsu's JSS Software and is looking forward to seeing how it may assist judges and spectators during the Paris 2024 Games.\n\n\"Fine margins in the angle of a handstand or degree to which a gymnast shows splits could be the difference between a gold or silver medal winning score. So, to have technology help ensure fair decisions in this blink-and-you'll-miss-it sport, can give both competitors and fans more confidence in the results.\" - Jennifer McIlveen OLY, Tech.co Editor and Olympian\n\nAI is also going to be used to improve the safety of Paris 2024 attendees. The Games' surveillance system will rely on AI-powered cameras to automatically flag potential security threats. After these cameras detect risks, they will relay issues to security personnel, where workers can take action to confirm risks and resolve them.\n\nWhile the use of AI isn't normally permitted in French surveillance activities, the country passed a law in March of 2023 that allows the use of AI security in large-scale events like the Olympics. Specifically, the law permits the technology to be used to identify crowd surges, the presence of weapons, signs of fire, abandoned objects, and other abnormal risks.\n\nThe IOC has designed a new AI-powered monitoring system to protect athletes from online abuse. The mechanism will use artificial intelligence to monitor hundreds of thousands of social media accounts and will flag any potentially abusive messages to the relevant platforms.\n\nThe IOC also created an AI chatbot to make important information more accessible to athletes. The Intel-powered Athlete365 platform was designed to provide easy and quick answers to frequently asked questions on topics like social media guidelines, Rule 50 regulations, anti-doping rules, and more.\n\nAI is also being used to curb unnecessary energy usage in the Paris arena. The energy usage in Paris will be monitored in real-time using digital-twin technology. The new environmentally conscious system will help organizers see where they need power, where they need to place cameras, and if they need to address any potential accessibility issues.\n\nAccording to Ilario Corna, the IOC's Chief Technology Officer, the committee \"started gathering various operational data as far back as 2020\" to make the management of the 2024 Games more energy efficient.\n\nArtificial Intelligence will also be transforming the Olympic experience for each viewer. The Official AI Platform Partner for Paris 2024, Intel, has been developing a new Automatic Highlights Generation system capable of automatically compiling key sporting moments into tailored highlight reels. The technology was trained on Olympic archive videos and can be customized to meet the needs of different media outlets.\n\nAI will also be leveraged by NBC's Peacock service to improve events coverage, online and in the Peacock app. It will be used to recreate the voice of Al Michaels, an American sports broadcaster with over 50 years of industry experience, from 5,000 hours of live coverage. His voice will be used to create 10-minute highlight playlists every day, tailored to each user's topic and sporting preferences and packaged as 'Your Daily Olympic Recap'.", "source": {"uri":

According to one recent survey, this can be largely attributed to a lack of expertise and strategy among faculty and administrators. The technology can be daunting, and when combined with concerns about academic integrity, lack of security and the tendency of AI to \"hallucinate\" or give faulty answers, AI faces significant headwinds at universities and colleges.\n\nHowever, just like in any other industry, institutions that do not adopt AI will quickly fall behind. Large language models (LLM) are here to stay, and are rapidly becoming part of the toolkit used in STEM work, such as coding, data analysis, engineering, biomedical research, and other fields. On the administrative side, AI can help reduce cost and improve the student experience with IT help desk issues, registration and class schedules, and other parts of day-to-day operations. It's vital that educational institutions seize this opportunity to provide a safe and secure AI experience for students, faculty, and staff.\n\nThe question is, how can educational institutions do this systematically, securely, cost-effectively, and efficiently?\n\nMany institutions are hesitant to use some of the more prevalent AI tools, such as ChatGPT, due to how the training models operate. These tools pose significant security challenges to university and researchers alike, since all input data becomes part of the dataset from which the AI can pull. This presents a risk that proprietary or private data will be inadvertently made public through the LLM, creating challenges from both a compliance and an IP standpoint.\n\nHowever, building your own LLM from scratch is prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest corporations or research labs, as it requires vast GPU server farms and millions of dollars of compute time to train the model. It's a non-starter for most colleges or universities, particularly those under budget and staffing constraints.\n\nUtilizing open source LLMs, such as Granite, Llama, or Mistral AI, is a viable third way for universities and colleges to build a scalable AI solution that can be tailored to an institution's needs. While training and building an LLM model is expensive, the models themselves are lightweight once they are deployed and they can be run off of a single server or endpoint on the network. These solutions can then be customized to a university's needs with varying degrees of guardrails put in place about how external information can be accessed, who has access, and how information can be stored and made available.\n\nIt's not enough to keep information secure. Colleges and universities must be assured that the information they're receiving from the AI is trustworthy and accurate. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), an approach that uses your own custom data to confine the results of open source models, can help. It can be customized to alleviate concerns about data being leaked or misused, and can create new user experiences based on per-app or per-user profile prompting. Implementing an open source project on an internal server with limited or no external access and built out with RAG entry points and other augmentations can be done in just a few weeks.\n\nChoosing an open source AI solution will likely come down to either a single-point or platform approach.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nHere's the TLDR, according to Altman's ChatGPT: \"The urgent question of our time is whether the US and its allies will lead the global AI future to benefit democracy or let authoritarian regimes shape it for their own power.\"\n\nTo this end, the first step in Altman's plan is to ensure proper safeguards around AI technology. \"American AI firms and industry need to craft robust security measures to ensure that our coalition maintains the lead in current and future models and enables our private sector to innovate,\" he wrote. These measures should include \"cyber defense and data center security innovations\" that would \"prevent hackers from stealing key intellectual property,\" he added.\n\nNext up: Build the right infrastructure. Altman urged American policymakers to \"work with the private sector to build significantly larger quantities of the physical infrastructure -- from data centers to power plants -- that run the AI systems themselves.\"\n\nHe said that would help create more jobs and establish AI as a \"new industrial base\" in the United States. He also said the United States needs to invest in developing a new generation of AI innovators, researchers, and engineers. \"They are our true superpower,\" he wrote.\n\nThird, the United States should establish more regulations around trade and the transmission of information across borders. That includes \"clarity around how the United States intends to implement export controls and foreign investment rules for the global build out of AI systems,\" he wrote. That also means establishing rules for where materials -- like training data, chips, and code -- are stored worldwide. It's \"not just about exporting technology,\" he wrote. \"It's about exporting the values that the technology upholds.\"\n\nAnd finally, Altman suggested that the United States needs to develop a global strategy for AI so that developing nations aren't left behind. Altman proposed several solutions, including creating something similar to an International Atomic Energy Agency for AI, which would help promote peaceful use of the technology.\n\nHe suggested establishing an investment fund that would pool resources from countries committed to safely developing AI. Another option, he wrote, would be to build a nonprofit similar to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, ICANN, which would be dedicated to \"maximizing access to the internet in support of an open, connected, democratic global community.\"\n\nAltman's editorial comes as the threat from China to US AI dominance grows. Last year, the United States took the lead in global AI investment, pouring over $67 billion into the technology, according to Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. China came in second, investing close to $8 billion. But most analysts expect that number to rise quickly.\n\n\"We need the democratic -- small 'd' democratic -- world to win here, and we have the opportunity to do it,\" Altman told Axios.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lakshmi_varanasi@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lakshmi Varanasi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICANN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a29a15aab37011780a958b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Today, thousands of exciting projects are being taken to production in all industries, while a report by Deloitte found that use of gen AI by employees at Australian workplaces rose to 38% in 2023. Despite the wide and fast adoption of AI, businesses across the region are struggling to keep up, trying to educate employees about the risks of AI and introducing secure applications provided by experienced technology vendors. If you're struggling with implementing AI in production, upskilling your workforce, or choosing trusted, secure solutions that respect compliance requirements, we're here to help. Our upcoming AI workshop in Sydney will help organisations navigate this challenging AI journey and accelerate their time to market.\n\nCanonical's promise to offer secure open software goes beyond Ubuntu and covers your entire stack, including AI tooling. We provide solutions to enable organisations to run their ML workloads at all scales, from workstations to cloud and edge devices. The company's experience of 20 years in the open source space is reflected in the AI industry, and is the reason we help organisations assess their AI readiness and build their ML infrastructure.\n\nAI readiness assessment\n\nAI has a huge potential to optimise costs, reduce manual tasks and enable innovation within any department. Organisations are put in front of a technological transformation that challenges them to restructure their entire infrastructure and reshape many of their processes. From optimising the compute power to introducing new tooling that enables machine learning operations (MLOps), they need to go through an entire journey before seeing any return on investment.\n\nAny AI initiative starts with initial experimentation on a workstation, which does not present a lot of problems. As projects progress, there is a need for more sophisticated tooling that can be used to automate ML workloads, optimise ML models and deploy them to edge devices. During the workshop, we will guide organisations in assessing their AI readiness and discuss how to build their architecture, depending on the use case or existing infrastructure.\n\nGenAI with open source tooling\n\nLinux Foundation reported in 2023 that almost half of the organisations prefer open source tooling for their GenAI projects. Open source lowers the barrier to entry, fosters collaboration and enables practitioners to experiment quickly. Despite this, enterprises still struggle because of security concerns, scalability of the ML tooling and costs associated with any GenAI initiatives.\n\nDuring the executive AI workshop in Sydney, I will talk about how open source enables GenAI projects. During the talk, I will focus on the key considerations and challenges that organisations face when moving GenAI projects from experimentation to production, as well as the common pitfalls that the industry faces. The talk will highlight open source tools such as OpenSearch and Kubeflow, that are used to productise GenAI initiatives and what are the security risks that they address. At the end of it, you will be better equipped to run your GenAI projects in production, using secure open source tooling.\n\nFuture of AI in Asia-Pacific\n\nHalfway through the year, we will take the proposed points and do a deep dive into the topic, focusing on the Asia-Pacific region. Together with industry leaders from Dell Technologies and Firmusgrid Supercloud Pty Ltd, we will discuss about the challenges that companies face when it comes to AI, industries that are ahead of time and the next big things that Australia will embrace\n\nThis event is by invitation only and tailored specifically for executive and senior management levels. Invitations will be sent out one month prior to the event to ensure a curated and impactful experience.

This notwithstanding, recent advancements in AI have had a profound impact across the industry; AI is being deployed to design more efficient airframes and engines, invent new composite materials, and to enhance safety, fuel efficiency and overall performance.\n\nIn the area of predictive maintenance, AI systems are able to analyse vast amounts of real time data from aircraft and engine sensors, combining this with its analysis of historical maintenance records to predict potential failures before they occur. This helps airlines to optimise their maintenance schedules and thus reduce downtime and improve fleet availability.\n\nIn air traffic management, AI optimises route planning, airspace operation, and traffic flow, allowing for more efficient use of airspace thus minimising delays, reducing fuel burn and emissions.\n\nIn and around airports, AI systems are deployed in a variety of scenarios too, from passport and security checks to baggage handling, as well as enhancing the passenger experience through a more bespoke and efficient service, leading to fewer delays. And for airports which can't employ enough staff to carry out day to day functions, an AI-led robotic approach is proving critical to enable them to sustain their operations.\n\nIt is clear that AI plays an important role in an often sensitive and high-risk environment, putting it front and centre of many new laws governing AI, including the EU AI Act. This is an increase of the compliance burden for companies operating in the aviation industry, on top of what is already a highly regulated sector.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_maintenance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Predictive maintenance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airframe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airframe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuel efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Composite material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuel economy in aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.\n\nJust about everyone is using AI at work nowadays. According to a report this month from Netskope Threat Labs, 96% of offices are using some type of generative AI application. ChatGPT is far and away the most popular, with 80% of offices using it, but more than half are using Grammarly, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini.\n\nAcceptance and wide use of AI is just the first step, though. Employees have to be using it safely, not uploading proprietary data to open systems, and it's also important that all apps being used are worthy of trust. Netskope found that 77% of companies block at least one AI application, with the majority of those blocking 2.6 apps. More than a quarter -- 28% -- block presentation maker Beautiful.ai, but writing assistant Writesonic and image generator Craiyon are also blocked by more than a fifth of offices.\n\nThe constant proliferation of new AI apps, however, makes it difficult to protect your data just by blocking. More than 42% of companies are using sophisticated forms of data loss prevention. These involve things like blocking certain queries that may contain sensitive data, adding \"coaching\" interventions that make users stop and explain why they are trying to use an AI system in a certain way, and observing the kind of data that is pulled in large chunks from company data repositories. Netskope found these methods are largely effective. More than half of users stop the action they are trying to do when coaching prompts come up, the report found. However, the most common sensitive data uploaded to AI systems is source code, showing that the industry's focus on making AI coding apps is at least gaining steam.\n\nHowever, workplace AI applications are in a constant state of change. CIOs need to stay on top of both what is being used in their offices and up-and-coming AI trends, carefully evaluating the risks and rewards of different applications. And it may not get easier as generative AI becomes more common. After all, everyone is familiar with email, and yet security experts agree it's the top cybersecurity risk to companies today, mostly because of the way users interact with it.\n\nCompanies trying to create their own AI systems often run into problems after they build prototypes. While the prototype works well, it can be a challenge to translate it into a full system. I talked to Matthew Zeiler, cofounder and CEO of AI processes company Clarifai, about how to get past these issues. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.\n\nIt's been an eventful week for Google. Cloud security startup Wiz walked away from a $23 billion acquisition offer from the tech giant, a deal that would have been Google's largest ever. The deal was buzzed about in tech circles after the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the two were in advanced talks. Forbes senior editor Alex Konrad writes that Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport sent a letter to employees outlining his company's next plans: Pursuing a $1 billion annual recurring revenue target, and then its own IPO. According to Bloomberg, this is the second big acquisition Google has been unable to complete this month; it also walked away from efforts to purchase HubSpot.\n\nThings did not improve when Google's parent company Alphabet reported earnings after markets closed on Tuesday. While its Q2 revenue of $84.2 billion beat analysts' estimates, its stock fell more than 5% when trading began on Wednesday. There were two big reasons behind the sell off. YouTube advertising missed analysts' estimates -- even though it actually increased 13% year-over-year. And Google's capital expenditures are also on the rise. The company is investing heavily in AI -- a likely total outlay of $49 billion in cap ex, which is 84% above its average over the last five years, reports the Wall Street Journal.\n\nGoogle, electric car maker Tesla, which reported slowing sales on Wednesday, and credit card company Visa, which also missed revenue goals, all brought the stock market as a whole down on Wednesday. The S&P 500 slid 2%, and the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- top tech stocks including Alphabet, Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Apple -- collectively lost $800 billion in value.\n\nMany companies are launching AI-powered applications, but in the rush to get in on the technology, it makes sense for executives and developers to pause and ensure they are solving the right problems. Employees say Target, which created \"Help AI\" as an internal chatbot providing knowledge about store processes, didn't take this maxim into consideration, Forbes senior writer Cyrus Farivar writes. The chatbot provides many wrong or misleading answers. Employees said it couldn't explain basic store terminology, refused to give tips about dealing with an impolite co-worker, and advised workers to confront an active shooter in the store with a weapon -- something the Department of Homeland Security explicitly advises against. A Target spokesperson told Forbes the retailer is open to feedback about the bot, but employees said the retailer focused on the wrong problems. An AI system that could help balance employee workloads, do a better job of tracking merchandise shipments, or find trends in services such as shopper pickup, they said, might actually help them.\n\nMuch of the modern world was literally brought to its knees last week after a glitch in a CrowdStrike update took millions of enterprise computer systems using Microsoft products offline. The outage impacted businesses including airlines, banks, media outlets and healthcare facilities. CrowdStrike and Microsoft pushed out a fix within hours, and the world slowly got back online. However, Delta Airlines seemed to experience the most problems, with thousands of flights canceled and delayed for days. On Tuesday, five days after the meltdown, 41% of Delta flights were still disrupted, Forbes' Suzanne Rowan Kelleher reported.\n\nOne major U.S. carrier saw zero issues: Southwest Airlines. Forbes senior contributor Ted Reed explains why: Major portions of Southwest's computer system are using Windows 3.1, the version of the operating system first launched in 1992. \"It's typically not a good idea to wait so long to update, but in this one instance Southwest has done itself a favor,\" Government Technology wrote.\n\nThis shouldn't be seen as a good reason to delay system updates, though. After all, a meltdown of outdated tech used for crew scheduling following massive blizzards led to Southwest canceling 16,900 flights and stranding more than 2 million passengers over the Christmas holiday in 2022. Southwest had to pay more than $600 million in customer refunds and reimbursements, and the U.S. Department of Transportation socked the airline with a $140 million civil penalty.\n\nIt's easy to come up with a working prototype for an AI solution at your company. It's much harder to turn that idea into a deployed system. Clarifai, a company that specializes in streamlining processes for AI, recently published a report about AI sprawl -- when the use cases for a system push beyond their original scope -- and how it adds more problems to the already challenging development cycle. Founder and CEO Matthew Zeiler talked to me about the issues many companies face in their development and how to solve them. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.\n\nA lot of companies that are working on AI say, 'We've got a great prototype. It works well, but it's been a long time and we haven't been able to get the full version working.' What's usually the hangup between the prototype and the actual deployment?\n\nZeiler: That's what we have coined the false finish line. People can quickly get running on a laptop. There's a bunch of tools that either are open source or provided by companies that help you stitch together stuff, but at the end of the day, those are really just API clients. They're very surface-level integrations.\n\nWhen you think of getting to production, it means is this thing trustable in front of your customers? Is it going to stay up 24/7? Is it going to autoscale when your traffic changes? Are you going to have feedback loops so that when your data changes, your models are still going to remain accurate? Are you evaluating the accuracy of your models on your real world data? Or is just, 'It works in one example in my prototype, so it works for good'?\n\nThat's unrealistic. There's all those considerations that are preventing people from going from prototype to production. The timelines become many months to years, depending on your application and how many applications you want to get into production.\n\nHow does anybody get past the false finish line?\n\nYou have two choices. You could stitch together a bunch of different tools. At every layer you could choose from third party vendors, open source tools. It becomes a daunting task that you need AI expertise to even navigate. You have to stitch it together, write tests, which you're probably not going to do. It can take you a lot of time to make these tools work together. You have to keep them up to date and state-of-the-art. It's a very brittle system. If any of the platforms go down or their APIs change or whatever, everything breaks. We've seen that firsthand. The whole program can stall for weeks at a time.\n\nThat's the technology side. Another aspect is streamlining just the processes, procuring all the different tools, reviewing legal terms, reviewing security, trying to understand where your data may live.\n\n[A company that deals with AI architecture can] help you streamline that. So those are the two choices. Go with the AI workflow orchestration approach, or stitch it all together yourself.\n\nWhat advice would you give to a CIO trying to go from AI prototype to deployment?\n\n[Ask yourself] what business problem are you trying to solve, and what do you expect AI to do? Is AI even the right tool for that problem? More and more, it is the right tool. Once you understand the problem, then start to think about how you're going to solve that. And that's where five different layers of consideration come in. The two AI-specific layers are the model and data considerations. What model are you going to use? What does the model need to do?\n\nGetting your data to be AI ready is really, really important. That's going to be the first thing that's going to block you, because you won't be able to get a model to work well on your specific data until your data's in order.\n\nThe remaining three layers are where you want to go from that prototype to actual production. Do you have the compute to process all these workloads? Is it going to be secure? When you're thinking about your vendor stack and your use case, that could mean very different things. We work with the intelligence community on top secret networks, and they have to deploy our stack on-premise, disconnected from the internet. Security for them is very different than a mobile app that can connect to the internet. And then the control layer really becomes important for those Day 2 operations and large-scale enterprise multi-use case, preventing the AI sprawl problem.\n\nStartup Cloverleaf Infrastructure closed a funding round last week to deliver shovel-ready sites for the construction of hyperscale data centers with access to enough power to handle AI queries.\n\n$300 million: Amount the startup raised from Sandbrook Capital and NGP\n\n9%: Proportion of U.S. electricity that data centers are expected to use by 2030, up from 4% today\n\n'This is a complex power orchestration problem': Cloverleaf cofounder Brian Janous said\n\nComputer science spans a wealth of topics, from the widely used to the obscure. These five concepts are less known, but could result in new innovations.\n\nIt's been assumed employees will not want to embrace AI for fear it will take their jobs. Surveys show this is not the case, and they are excited for the benefits it can bring.\n\nThere are currently 10,000 functioning satellites orbiting Earth, estimates Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics astronomer Jonathan McDowell.

Read the previous one here.\n\nIt certainly has been a busy period for the news cycle, so it's understandable you may have missed some stuff in the past few days.\n\nThat includes a couple of things that involve perhaps the biggest name in AI -- Microsoft.\n\nA week later, it was announced that the company's unusual relationship with generative AI startup Inflection AI would be referred for an initial merger investigation in the U.K.\n\nThat's funny, because Microsoft went to great lengths to frame its deal with Inflection as anything but an acquisition -- rather it just hired the startup's co-founders, most of its 70-person staff, and licensed its technology.\n\nBut it wasn't an acquisition.\n\nThe initial investigation will last through the summer, and there's no telling how it will play out. Microsoft scored a win of sorts in June when the EU Commission said it was dropping its probe into the company's relationship with OpenAI.\n\nHowever, it does seem Microsoft is playing with fire. There appears to be an announcement every month about some agency -- foreign or domestic -- looking into its AI dealings. Jumping off OpenAI's board seemed to be a move -- albeit very small -- by two AI giants to try to avoid more antitrust scrutiny.\n\nThe Inflection AI deal seemed to be screaming for that scrutiny and now it seems like it'll be getting it.\n\nThere is no doubt of Microsoft's intense interest in the space. Its venture arm, M12 just led a $40 million round for San Francisco-based Armada, which helps with the implementation of artificial intelligence in an edge computing environment.\n\nNevertheless, Microsoft may be getting closer to real problems with every AI deal it consummates. While AI holds the promise of reducing -- or even eliminating -- the workload for a lot of people, it seems like it will only increase it for the Microsoft legal team.\n\nJust a month ago we wrote about AI's impact on the legal tech industry, and this week provided a perfect illustration with not one, but two huge raises.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vancouver-based legal tools platform Clio raised a big $900 million Series F at a $3 billion valuation led by New Enterprise Associates. On the same day, San Francisco-based artificial intelligence startup Harvey raised a $100 million Series C led by GV with participation from the likes of OpenAI, Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital at a $1.5 billion valuation.

But the real test will be if the tech can make their firms more money.", "body": "Hello! The iPhone could reportedly get a major redesign to turn it into a...flip phone. What year are we living in?\n\nIn today's big story, dozens of Wall Street employees open up about how they are (or aren't) using AI on the job.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nMarkets: What a second Trump term would mean for the deficit, inflation, and yields. Tech: Some early-stage founders have reevaluated their startup dreams, opting for corporate life instead. Business: The best bet for fixing your love life might be the government. (It's not as weird as it sounds.)\n\nBut first, I got a tool for that.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story AI pulse check on Wall Street\n\n\"How are you using generative AI?\"\n\nThe question has dominated the business world for almost two years. Once ChatGPT graced us with its presence, everyone wanted to know how to leverage the tech to get ahead.\n\nWall Street, with its reams of data and need to analyze complex topics, has always been viewed as fertile ground for the AI revolution. So Business Insider's finance team spoke with almost three dozen finance workers across the industry about how they're using AI.\n\nFrom helping to identify startups to invest in to aggregating thousands of analyst notes to cutting down the time spent on busy work, AI use cases on the Street ran the gamut.\n\nOverall, generative AI typically helped finance professionals do their jobs faster, easier, or both.\n\nNot everyone is sold. Some don't see the \"breakthrough\" possibilities of the tech that so many have prophesied, finding it hard to see specific uses of AI in their own processes.\n\nAnd to be fair, they might not be wrong. As much as Wall Street likes to tout tech adoption, certain corners remain unchanged from decades ago, albeit with a few extra bells and whistles.\n\nNot unlike the workers it's looking to serve, gen AI's future on Wall Street will boil down to its ability to produce results.\n\nAI development doesn't come cheap. Whether you're starting from scratch or buying something off the shelf, there's plenty of costs to consider, from talent to hardware to retraining staff.\n\nBlackstone expects the US to spend roughly $1 trillion over the next five years building and facilitating new data centers that'll help power the gen AI wave.\n\nThat kind of cash means investors will want to see real changes in how things are done thanks to AI. It's a question Big Tech leaders are already fielding.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alphabet executives were pressed on whether Google's AI overview feature was generating more revenue for the firm, writes BI's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert. And Nvidia has plans to show how its customers are making money using its AI chips when it reports earnings next month.\n\nThey won't be alone, as Goldman expects the market to keenly watch if AI spend can translate to revenue.\n\nAnd that's in tech where companies are supposed to take big swings on innovative projects! Now consider Wall Street, where ROI is built into the core of the industry.\n\nWill those firms continue pouring money into tech that can't improve their bottom line? In the end, finance workers' views on using generative AI, whatever they are, might not matter.\n\n3 things in markets How the markets are pricing in a Trump win. With prediction markets favoring former President Donald Trump winning in November, the markets are reacting accordingly. Here's how the deficit, inflation, and yields would be impacted by Trump's potential return to the White House. Why the (market) party can keep going. Bank of America pointed to narrow junk-bond spreads and $6 trillion in cash as bullish indicators the market rally will continue. Even smaller-cap stocks enjoying a surge is a sign of a \"broadening of the rally,\" BofA technical analyst Stephen Suttmeier said. Small-cap stocks to buy for big gains amid rally. Historically cheap small-cap stocks are roaring back to life during a risky earnings season. But not all are in the clear, a small-cap strategist at Bank of America warned. Here are 9 stocks in sectors that should outperform. 3 things in tech Founders' dreams on hold. Amid the collapse of some 3,200 venture-backed startups this year, some early-stage founders are testing out life as corporate employees for a break. Despite the better quality of life in corporate jobs, most want to someday be founders again. \"This is our golf course.\" A Hamptons retreat for female founders includes free-flowing ros\u00e9, a freebie bin of Larroud\u00e9 sandals, and a speaker lineup that includes \"Sex and the City\" author Candace Bushnell. It's the rare sanctuary where women in business connect without men in the room. Mark Zuckerberg's brat summer. Hot Zuck Summer is in full swing, both personally and professionally for the Meta founder. He won high praise for open-sourcing Meta's AI model, Llama 3.1, which he's been promoting. He also debuted a summer glow with a goggle-shaped tan line around his eyes -- though he said it's not a hint about Meta's Orion AR project. 3 things in business Make America date again. Dating apps are so bad that young people are giving up on them altogether. Could a government-run matchmaking service be the answer to our loneliness epidemic. Group Black was supposed to even the playing field for Black-owned media. Instead, its momentum fizzled. Former staff and people close to the company blame its struggles on advertisers' broken pledges, internal disorganization, and execution stumbles. They're left wondering what its future holds. Are your credit card rewards making you a jerk? Companies love rewards, and cardholders do, too. But when everyone at group dinner is rushing to put their card down first, the struggle over who gets the points can get ugly real fast.

Researchers started gaining momentum in the early 2010s as deep learning proved useful in real-world applications such as speech recognition. The real inflection point, however, did not come until November 2022, when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.\n\nThe chatbot represented a huge leap in AI's capabilities. The ability to build intelligent systems out of computer chips, a goal that seemed decades away, now seems within reach. ChatGPT's advanced natural language processing abilities showcased the potential for AI to comprehend and generate human-like text, proving to be a versatile tool for a plethora of applications from customer service to content creation.\n\nThis technology has drastically changed the field of AI, driving activity in both the private sector and academia. Major technology companies and startups are investing heavily in AI development, creating a competitive landscape in the field. Universities are also ramping up their AI research programs to keep pace with industry advancements. According to the 2024 Stanford AI Index Report, this frenzy is reshaping industries through a surge in startup formation and accelerated research efforts.\n\nVerbit analyzed Stanford's AI Index Report to better understand how AI has changed in recent years and highlighted the exponential growth in AI-related publications and patents.\n\nVisit thestacker.com for similar lists and stories.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science", "label": "dmoz/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Nanotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Nanotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/299/29937/2993713.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

At the Republican Party convention on July 19, the presidential candidate referred to this technology in a passage of his speech devoted to the \"new golden age\" he hopes to bring about - and which \"all other countries,\" including China and Japan, are also seeking to achieve. \"We have to produce massive amounts of energy (...). But AI needs tremendous - literally, twice the electricity that's available now in our country, can you imagine?\" he warned, without mentioning the environmental consequences of such an energy boom.\n\nFor the former US president, AI development seems primarily to involve the deregulation of the sector. The Republican Party platform therefore promises to \"repeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.\"\n\nAdopted in October 2023, this presidential text aimed to \"protect Americans from the potential risks of AI systems\" by requiring, under the supervision of federal agencies, software manufacturers to conduct tests to ensure that they are \"safe, secure and trustworthy,\" to avoid breaches of national security, cyber-attacks, but also manipulation or algorithmic bias and discrimination.\n\nAt a recent hearing on AI and privacy, Senator J. D. Vance, Trump's vice presidential pick, extended this hostility to AI regulation: \"Very often CEOs, especially of larger technology companies that I think already have advantageous positions in AI will come and talk about the terrible safety dangers of this new technology and how Congress needs to jump up and regulate as quickly as possible. And I can't help but worry that if we do something under duress from the current incumbents, it's going to be to the advantage of those incumbents and not to the advantage of the American consumer.\"\n\nOn X, he added that, in his opinion, \"a partisan group of crazy people use AI to infect every part of the information economy with left-wing bias.\" This argument is reminiscent of Trump's criticism of social media and joins Elon Musk's attacks on OpenAI or Google, accused of censoring free speech through moderation measures put in place to prevent their chatbots from broadcasting discriminatory responses or hate speech.

In 2023, India suffered extreme weather events almost daily during the first nine months of the year, killing 2,923 people and affecting close to 1.84 million hectares of crop area.\n\nEarlier this month, increased heat generation due to climate change led to more thunderstorms and lightning strikes, killing at least 64 people in the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The people killed were either transplanting paddy in fields, grazing cattle, or taking shelter under trees to protect themselves from rain.\n\n\"Addressing climate change with AI is a long-term commitment requiring sustained investment and consistent policies, which are not yet on the horizon,\" said Raj Kapoor, chairman of Global Alliance for Ethical AI Innovation.\n\n\"The inherent biases of AI models training data may often lead to unfair outcomes that disproportionately affect certain communities. In India, these are sensitive issues. Add to that the opacity of AI decision-making processes, lack of transparency, [making] it difficult for stakeholders to trust these systems,\" Kapoor added.\n\nLack of high-quality, comprehensive data is often unavailable or inconsistent, especially in remote areas. AI models also require high accuracy and reliability to predict complex climate systems effectively. Integrating AI with existing climate monitoring systems is a complex process, and scaling these models to handle global data continues to be a major hurdle.\n\nIn March, the government approved $1.24 billion for the next five years to boost the country's AI ecosystem, innovation and entrepreneurship. The initiative is expected to boost the country's global leadership in AI and ensure ethical and responsible AI deployment.\n\n\"The required infrastructure for AI, such as data centres, demands substantial investment and may not be feasible in all regions. India, with its diverse demography, will face these challenges,\" Kapoor pointed out. \"The global nature of climate change necessitates international coordination, which is challenging due to varying policies and priorities. Allocating adequate funding and ensuring efficient resource allocation are persistent issues. The need for interdisciplinary collaboration across climate science, data science, engineering, and social sciences, are often difficult to coordinate.\"\n\nMoreover, the production and disposal of AI hardware contribute to e-waste and resource depletion, and India is yet to find an optimal resolution to address this.\n\n\"India's policy framework for climate adaptation, while comprehensive, often suffers from inadequate implementation at the local level due to fragmented governance, lack of coordination among agencies, and insufficient capacity and resources,\" Kapoor stated.\n\n\"While India has committed substantial funds for climate action, the scale of the challenge necessitates much higher investment. Mobilising financial resources for large-scale adaptation projects, particularly in a developing country context, is challenging. That is further compounded by the need for technological advancements and infrastructure development, which require substantial initial investments and long-term maintenance,\" Kapoor added.\n\nThe plans\n\nEarlier this month, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the country is working towards achieving a reduction in emissions and building climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nIn June, Abhay Karandikar, secretary of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), said that DST's two missions -- the National Mission for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE) and the National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC) -- have led to significant progress in supporting 19 centers of excellence and 37 major research and development programs over the years.\n\n\"I believe that we may need to focus more on developing foundational models in AI in the Indian context,\" Karandikar said. He pointed out that indigenous climate models based on data would bring about a better understanding of addressing climate change.\n\n\"Collective efforts towards a holistic approach involving researchers from multiple disciplines and a range of stakeholders can help address ongoing challenges of climate change and its effect on agriculture, water and environment,\" Karandikar said.\n\nIn March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a conversation with Bill Gates, called for redefining economic growth parameters to prioritise concepts like green GDP (gross domestic product), green income and green employment.\n\nModi said he is introducing a clean hydrogen boat to support the Clean Ganga movement, a project aimed at effectively abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of the National River Ganga.\n\n\"Reuse and recycle is in the nature of Indians,\" Modi told Gates. \"It doesn't matter how much external effort we put in or innovations we do; if we don't embrace a lifestyle that respects nature, it is not going to work. The goal should be to evaluate environment-friendly and climate-friendly innovations. India's Mission Life urges people to take action towards environmental protection and conservation.\"\n\nInterestingly, in its Mission Life initiative, the government said that the country's per capita carbon footprint is 60% lower than the global average because the country's lifestyle is still rooted in sustainable traditional practices as sustainability has always been a part of India's tradition, culture and values.\n\n\"Using AI can lead to significant cost savings by optimizing resource usage, reducing waste, improving energy efficiency, and preventing environmental disasters through early detection and intervention. This can also stimulate economic growth by creating new job opportunities and fostering innovation in green technologies,\" Sharan said.\n\n\"India can make the best use of AI by developing robust data collection systems, investing in AI research specific to environmental applications, promoting public-private partnerships for AI innovation, and integrating AI tools in policy-making for efficient resource management, early warning systems, and monitoring environmental changes,\" Sharan added.\n\nClimate change and AI in agriculture\n\nIndia, the world's largest democracy with 1.4 billion people, is primarily an agrarian economy, with about 55% of the total workforce engaged in agricultural and allied sector activities. The South Asian nation is one of the world's biggest producers of rice, wheat and sugar, making accurate weather forecasting extremely significant. The Asian powerhouse is also the world's second-largest tea producer, after China, and has suffered crop loss and reduced productivity due to drought and changing rainfall patterns caused by climate change.\n\nIndia's agrarian economy is highly susceptible to climatic variations, jeopardizing food security and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, due to erratic rainfall patterns and extreme weather conditions. Moreover, depleting groundwater and inefficient water management practices lead to water scarcity, significantly affecting agricultural activities.\n\nAccording to a PwC study, the integration of AI into agriculture has led to the emergence of \"precision agriculture,\" where AI plays a more prescriptive role in emission reduction. Also known as \"smart farming,\" precision agriculture seeks to enhance productivity, improve agricultural yields and reduce resource consumption with the guidance of AI.\n\nFor instance, precision fertilizer applications utilize sensors, software, and application hardware to monitor and analyze real-time conditions of crops, soil, and other indicators of crop growth. Automated systems, built upon AI techniques, then adjust the rate of fertilizer applications to optimal levels, decreasing waste and the environmental footprint of fertiliser use.\n\nAccording to the PwC report, one such application is Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), a method of optimized irrigation to minimize water-intensive overflooding of rice fields.\n\n\"Aided by Terrascope's AI-enabled carbon management platform, a programme that implemented AWD for 700 rice farms in Northern India reported 48% reduction in methane emissions, 20% reduction in costs and 12% jump in harvest. AI levers can thus help to guide decisions and actions around decarbonisation more effectively,\" the PwC stated in its study.\n\nInterestingly, the World Economic Forum India's Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in collaboration with India's Union Ministry of Agriculture and the Indian state of Telangana, has introduced the AI4AI initiative (AI for Agriculture Innovation). Over eight months beginning June 2020, this initiative held over 45 workshops, to discuss the challenges smallholder farmers face. These discussions led to an AI4AI plan that helped smallholder farmers by harnessing the power of new technologies, including AI, blockchain and drones.\n\nThe AI4AI framework was tested among 7,000 farmers in the Khammam district of Telangana. The pilot took 18 months and three crop cycles to complete. During this time, farmers reported a significant surge in net income -- $800 per acre in a single crop cycle (six months) -- effectively doubling the average income. The digital advisory services contributed to a 21% increase in chili yield production per acre. Pesticide use fell by 9%, fertilizers dropped by 5%, and quality improvements boosted unit prices by 8%. As a result, in October 2023, the state government expanded the Saagu Baagu initiative to include 500,000 farmers, covering five crops across 10 districts.\n\nAI for accurate weather prediction\n\nSo far, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has announced plans to use AI and machine learning to predict weather conditions and has reportedly put together a network of 39 doppler weather radars covering 85% of India's landmass that allow hourly forecasts for major cities.\n\n\"We have started using artificial intelligence in a limited way, but within the next five years, AI will significantly enhance our models and techniques,\" IMD's director general, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, said in April.\n\n\"Incorporating AI and machine learning allows us to harness past data to extract valuable insights and improve forecasting accuracy without solely relying on traditional physics-based models,\" Mohapatra added.\n\nAI and machine learning (ML) techniques are also being used to improve weather, climate, and ocean forecast prediction at various institutes under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). MoES said it envisages that many weather and climate forecasts will be based on hybrid technology combining AI, ML models and traditional numerical weather prediction models. MoES said it is committed to enhance the High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure as well. AI and ML-based data-driven modeling is required for generating species-specific Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) advisories for fishermen across the coastal states in India.\n\n\"The first thing we need to do is to leverage predictive analytics for accurate weather and climate forecasting, optimising renewable energy production and grid management, and implementing precision agriculture to enhance crop yields and water usage efficiency,\" Kapoor said.\n\n\"With AI monitoring air and water quality in real-time, timely pollution control measures can be addressed. AI can optimise the generation and distribution of renewable energy. By predicting energy production from solar and wind sources and managing grid stability, AI will streamline the use of renewable resources and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Finally, the ability of AI to analyse large datasets will place the spotlight on effective environmental policy-making,\" Kapoor added.\n\nIndia said it is committed to achieving the Net Zero emissions target by 2070 and is considering implementing the \"Lifestyle for Environment Mission\" (LiFE) initiative and promoting AI for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs).\n\nWork in progress\n\nIndia's largest information technology service provider, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has introduced an AI, ML, and analytics-powered solution that aims to meet city and business demands while complying with eco-friendly protocols and regulations.\n\n\"Cities and enterprises today are on a journey to become operationally interconnected, resilient, and sustainable as they work to balance responsible growth and climate strategies,\" TCS said.\n\n\"TCS Intelligent Urban Exchange (IUX) for intelligent climate action is an advanced AI and ML-powered decisioning sustainability solution that delivers comprehensive insights, recommendations, and metrics for environmentally responsible city, enterprise, and value chain operations,\" the company stated.\n\nOn the other hand, two local non-profit organizations, Gujarat Mahila Housing Sewa Trust and Villgro Innovation Foundation, are reportedly leveraging AI, ML, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to tackle the threats of water scarcity and flooding in India.\n\nGujarat Mahila Housing Sewa Trust aims to build an AI-based model to improve climate resilience in Amalner town in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. The model is expected to act as a blueprint for similar small urban towns in India, and provide them with an effective framework to reduce the risks of climate change and build resilience to natural disasters.\n\n\"Disaster preparedness through AI-powered early warning systems and risk assessments mitigates the economic impact of natural disasters, reducing costs associated with recovery and rebuilding. AI also facilitates compliance with environmental regulations by monitoring emissions in real-time and automating reporting, thus avoiding fines and reducing manual compliance costs,\" Kapoor added.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

In fact, according to a study conducted by Pearson, many teachers expressed little confidence in their own ability to successfully use AI. Simultaneously, however, the study showed that despite teachers' trepidations, they did and do believe in th potential of AI in the classroom.\n\nEven though teachers were a little slower than students in picking up the tech, recently, innovators in the industry have started pushing forward in creating AI to assist teachers in ways that are effective and easy to use - and it's working.\n\nThis shift has been transformative for the AI industry at large, but most importantly, it's changed the lives of teachers in particular. Not only does this technology help them save time during their busy schedules, giving them more capacity to focus on other aspects of their work, but it also helps them improve the overall quality and consistency of their output and the influence they have on their students.\n\nLet's take a look at the different ways in which AI assistants and general AI tech can be used by teachers, as well as the advantages that AI can have for teachers, schools and, at the end of the day, students.\n\nIn shifting the focus from how AI can help students to how it can be used constructively by educators, innovators needed to properly understand the difference in objectives of each group. One of the most significant obstacles faced by teachers is a lack of time in light of the immense amount of work they need to do on a daily basis, in addition to engaging with students.\n\nThe most important consideration for teachers, therefore, is how to help them do everything they need to do while maintaining a high level of quality and consistency.\n\nIn response to this need, here are some ways AI is now being used to assist teachers:\n\nAI teaching assistants can be used to create an array of different supplementary learning resources that can be incredibly helpful in the classroom. This can include things like lesson plans, informative handouts, tests and assignments.\n\nBy feeding informtion into the AI software, the virtual assistant will be able to produce resources in accordance with the guidelines and parameters set by the teacher.\n\nThat is, a teacher working on creating a history quiz for their students about the American Civil War, for instance, will be able to tell the teaching assistant what they want - including the length of the quiz, the types of questions it ought to include, the level of difficulty of the quiz and more. From there, the software will produce a quiz that meets all these requirements - along with an accurate memo. Quizizz is a great example of this, creating high-quality quizzes for teachers to be used by students - it also boasts additional tools including slideshow generation and more.\n\nOne of the main time-wasters, so to speak, that teachers deal with on a daily basis is the signiificant amount of clerical work they have to do. However, basic clerical work and administration is one of the easiest things for AI to handle, and with AI programmes specially designed for use in school systems, educators are able to automate a lot of work that they used to have to do manually, including:\n\nMagic School is one such AI teaching assistant that teachers can utilise to perform these types of tasks, offering a a diverse range of tools, ranging from generating markig rubrics to creating fun and unique lesson plans. It also operates as an organisational tool for busy teachers.\n\nIndeed, the main challenge involved in having to do these things on a daily basis is the amount of time it takes teachers, who are already limited in that sense, and the difficulty of maintaining high quality and consistency.\n\nNot only do these helpful AI teaching assistants make completing these tasks way quicker, but they also remove a lot of potential for human error and introduce a higher level of consistency.\n\nCreativity is a big and important part of being a teacher, but it can be challenging for those who have been teaching for a long time to constantly produce new and exciting lesson plans, especially when they have so much to do.\n\nNow, AI teaching assistants like Lesson Pilot can use artificial intelligence to give them a helping hand in coming up with and enhancing lesson plans. By feeding these programms prompts regarding the purpose of the activity or lesson, as well as guidelines pertaining to the age group of the students, the subject and more, teachers will have access to unique and createive lesson plans that are tailored to both the teacher and the students' needs.\n\nOne of the potentially most helpful things educators can do in assisting learners is provide them with personalised feedback specifically tailored to their performance and their needs.\n\nHowever, the reality of being able to do this is far more challenging than it sounds, because, among other things, it's incredibly time consuming, and there are only so many hours in the day.\n\nAI teaching assistants are making significant strides in combattig this issue, however, with the ability to assess the performance of students on a personalised level. These programmes can collect data from the class as a whole and analyse it accordingly to advise teachers on learning areas to focus on, as well as areas where students are excelling. They can also provide analysis of individual students' performances, assessing their strengths and weaknesses, something that, for most busy teachers, is simply far too time consuming.\n\nThere are a few AI programmes that have emerged as leaders in this particular area of educational AI, including Pearson's teaching assistant software.\n\nThe idea behind the use of AI in the classroom is to be able to use it as a tool to compliment teachers' skills, rather than replace them, as many seem fear is on the horizon.", "source": {"uri": "techround.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRound"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teaching assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesson_plan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lesson plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rubric (academic)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://techround.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/annika-gordon-cZISY8ai2iA-unsplash-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

To investigate, we researched how companies are using AI for innovation and found that tools are just tools -- success depends on how organizations use these new tools now at their disposal. To investigate what kinds of innovation AI worked with, the authors performed two studies: first, a survey of 331 firms for practices on process improvement and new technology development, and second, an archival analysis of patent data on new technology development for a broader sample of more than 2,000 publicly traded firms. The results of these studies suggest that firms that have historically focused on specific types of innovation -- process innovation and innovation by diverse recombination, in which companies combine a wide variety of technology elements in new ways -- may benefit most from using advanced data capabilities of machine learning and AI. Firms that use AI analytics to generate wide recombinations are 3 to 7% more productive than firms that do not. Furthermore, when a firm's existing knowledge is spread throughout the firm, advanced AI capabilities can further boost firm innovation by about three more new patents a year. Conversely, using AI is less helpful for incremental innovation and making small improvements to existing products, and is almost no help at all for radical innovation.", "source": {"uri": "hbr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hbr                                "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic recombination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Inventions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Inventions", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Invention_and_Innovation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Invention and Innovation", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biologists", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biologists", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2024/07/Jul24_25_2003100693.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.607843137254902, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

That's something that most people never talked about. You know, we always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large developed countries that have xenophobic immigration policies...that don't allow anybody to come in, shrinking demographics...these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology, and if the promise...I didn't say it's gonna happen, but at the promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will, we'll be able to elevate the standard of living of countries, the standard of living of individuals, even with shrinking populations.\n\n\"And so, the paradigm of negative population growth is going to be changing, and the social problems that one will have in substituting humans for machines is going to be far easier in those countries that have declining populations.\"\n\nFink's comments manage to connect the dots between the AI everywhere agenda, and Degrowth, which The Trends Journal has been forecasting for years as a primary objective of technocratic elites.\n\nUltimately the Degrowth that has Fink and others salivating isn't the degrowth of wealth or power per se, but the degrowth of average human populations, leaving a smaller residue of humans to supposedly benefit from the wonders of an obviously transhuman age.\n\nAnd one of the ironies, of course, is that the productive fruits of many millions of that average natural humanity is being used to spur on the decimation, and the concentration of wealth and power into the hands of the few, who wish to position themselves as we have called the \"Obsolescent Gods\" of the future.\n\nThe YouTube Plunder, Courtesy of an \"Idealistic\" Non-Profit\n\nThe new expose by Wired and Proof News revealed that world-leading tech companies including Apple, Nvidia, and Salesforce have been using YouTube videos to train their AI systems in ways that violate the IP rights of human creatives, and the explicit terms of YouTube itself.\n\nDatasets from YouTube videos were compiled by a company called EleutherAI, and then used by AI tech companies who contracted with the dataset provider.\n\nAccording to Proof News, the range of content included everything from news organizations to entertainment channels, to general knowledge content providers, to popular YouTube stars and influencers:\n\nKhan Academy, MIT, and Harvard. The Wall Street Journal, NPR, and the BBC also had their videos used to train AI, as did \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" \"Last Week Tonight With John Oliver,\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\nProof News also found material from YouTube megastars, including MrBeast (289 million subscribers, two videos taken for training), Marques Brownlee (19 million subscribers, seven videos taken), Jacksepticeye (nearly 31 million subscribers, 377 videos taken), and PewDiePie (111 million subscribers, 337 videos taken).\n\n(\"Apple, Nvidia, Anthropic Used Thousands of Swiped YouTube Videos to Train AI,\" 16 Jul 2024.)\n\nProof News said they created a tool that aided in tracing content from YouTube channels and accounts that ended up in EleutherAI's datasets packaged for use for tech companies.\n\nThe fact that EleutherAI has a \"non-profit\" status and is one-step removed from companies making use of the lifted data was something that made it easier for tech companies to use the data, while avoiding direct, dirty hands in the scheme.\n\nEleutherAI did not reply to requests for comment about Proof's conclusions, the article noted, including inquiries about content creator claims that video, audio and transcripts were utilized without authorization.\n\nEleutherAI bills itself on its website as a egalitarian non profit:\n\nFounded in July 2020 by Connor Leahy, Sid Black, and Leo Gao, EleutherAI has grown from a Discord server for talking about GPT\u20113 to a leading non-profit research institute focused on large-scale artificial intelligence research. Our work has historically focused on providing access to cutting\u2011edge AI technologies by training and releasing models, and promoting open science norms in Natural Language Processing. As public access to large-scale pre\u2011trained AI models has substantially improved, our focus is shifting to researching AI interpretability and alignment.\n\nEleutherAI operates primarily through our public Discord server, where we discuss research in the field and coordinate our projects. We embrace an open and collaborative research model, and our discord server does not strongly differentiate between employees, volunteers, and collaborators at other institutions. However, our community specifically caters to researchers and research-level discussion, and we ask that people interested in learning about AI research primarily observe.\n\nEleutherAI employs two dozen full and part\u2011time research staff, who work alongside a dozen or so regular volunteers and external collaborators.\n\nCo-founder Conor Leahy's X feed has a pinned post where he voices his apprehension about the threats of fast-evolving AI:\n\nIf we build machines that are more capable than all humans, then the future will belong to them, not to us.\n\nEverything else derives from this simple observation.\n\nfor inviting me to make the case that \"This House Believes AI Is An Existential Threat.\"\n\nBut if that's the case, then EleutherAI is doing its part not only to train those AI systems, but has been ripping off human content creators to do it.\n\nOne of the company's main stated objectives is to provide AI developers with \"access to cutting-edge AI technologies by training and releasing models.\"\n\nThe Wired / Proof story quoted multiple human content creators who expressed dismay at the theft and use of their IP.\n\nDavid Pakman, producer of the left-leaning David Pakman Show, commented: \"This is my livelihood, and I put time, resources, money, and staff time into creating this content. There's really no shortage of work.\"\n\n\"It's theft,\" added Dave Wiskus, the CEO of Nebula, a streaming service owned partly by a group of human creatives that had their work stolen from YouTube to train AI, via the EleutherAI datasets.\n\nAI Costing Jobs, Hogging Energy and Empowering GovTech Oligarchy\n\nAlong with this latest scandal involving the core deceit at the heart of generative AI, news of other deleterious effects of AI continue to mount.\n\nAt this point, a growing number of MSM outlets are now more prominently considering what we have long forecast in these pages: that AI isn't like any previous revolutionary technology, creating vast numbers of new human occupations, though decimating some jobs and legacy industries.\n\nCombined with fast developing robotics and other technologies, AI adds up to massive permanent human worker obsolescence, and deleterious impacts such as skills and mental atrophy most still haven't fathomed.\n\nAs a Forbes headline contemplated this past week: \"How AI And Robot Job Displacements Could Lead Us Down The Road Of Universal Basic Income And Loss Of Identity\" (17 Jul 2024.)\n\nIn the U.K. and EU zone, meanwhile, outlets like The Declan Herald are saying the job losses are so potentially devastating that governments need to intervene to stop the disaster. (\"AI-led job loss is real, govt must intervene,\" 21 Jul 2024.)\n\nThat article cited a Periodic Labor Force Survey which estimated that AI would likely impact eight million U.K. jobs in the near to medium term, over a wide range of industries and occupations.\n\nThe survey noted that more than one in ten human jobs in the U.K. are already facing pressures of AI replacement.\n\nThe AI energy hog, meanwhile, is also forcing leading \"climate crisis\" advocates to suddenly dial back their disingenuous contentions that the world could just magically transition to \"clean\" energy sources like wind, solar and hydroelectric.\n\nAI consumption that will eat up the entire current electric grid capacity by as early 2030, according to some estimates, suddenly has mega billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates working on plans to start building more nuclear power plants.\n\nAlong with much of our other longtime forecasting regarding the \"green energy transition\" fantasy, it demonstrates that there are no current magical answers when it comes to energy production, only trade-offs.\n\nThe prospect of the power and money AI is already driving to companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google and bio-pharma and genetic startups that now heavily occupy the portfolio of Bill Gates, has put them between the rock of their climate alarmism and the hard place of their AI ambitions.\n\nNo doubt nuclear energy is about to get a huge image makeover.\n\nShould Average Humankind Be Satisfied With a UBI and Call It An Evolutionary Day?\n\nThe same technocrats who unleashed generative AI -- born and sustained via the rotten fruit of comprehensive human knowledge and IP theft -- fully understand all these facets of and likely outcomes of their actions.\n\nThey know the power of AI better than anyone. They now have forms of generative AI that they aren't releasing to the public, because it is \"too good.\"\n\nMicrosoft / OpenAI, for instance, has AI which can match voices of humans so perfectly, that it's deemed too likely to be abused in creating deep fake havoc if publically available.\n\nImagine what other advanced \"private\" AI might already be in use by privileged insiders of the Gov-Tech oligarchy.\n\nIt's no accident that current human AI overlords have been looking for ways to mollify average humanity, as they further separate themselves from the average, via the vast power and wealth grab AI technology is unleashing.\n\nThe notion of an AI supported \"Universal Basic Income\" is becoming more widely broached, replacing former narratives that AI creates a boon of amazing new human jobs and opportunities.\n\nBloomberg and others reported this past week that the results of the largest ever UBI experiment -- which just happened to be backed by Sam Altman's OpenAI -- has just completed and reported its results. (\"UBI Study Backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman Bolsters Support for Basic Income,\" 22 Jul 2024.)\n\nThe study gave 1000 dollars a month to select lower income recipients in some 150 U.S. locales, over a course of the past three years.\n\nAnd yes, that timeline dates from before OpenAI unleashed their free public preview of ChatGPT3, its advanced natural language generative AI onto the world in November of 2022.\n\nIn fact the study was begun around the time we were forecasting to readers that \"AI IS LEARNING YOUR JOB\".\n\nUnsurprisingly, the study found that the \"UBI\" cash was mostly spent on meeting basic needs like food and shelter, car payments and medical care.\n\nWhile the study claimed to show that workers did not just drop out of the workforce due to the UBI payments, the notion that 1000 dollars could sustain that, is absurd.\n\nThe study did show that people receiving the UBI money pared their work hours, compared to the general populace that did not receive the extra money.\n\nThe larger implications of the study by \"OpenResearch\" -- funded by OpenAI -- is that sooner or later, AI advancement will necessitate some form of support to those humans relegated to working obsolescence.\n\nBut why should a GovTech oligarchy that spawned a technology off massive human IP and data theft, and which accelerates the power of elites while destroying the middle and working classes of humanity, get to control the purse strings of AI?\n\nThat's the question they don't want people asking.\n\nOne Technology to Democratize and Govern Another?\n\nThere are other answers besides accepting a human existence on a GovTech dole, with all the disempowerment and inevitable pressures to reduce average human perpetuation that will come with that system as a feature, not a flaw.\n\nIn that regard, we have long forecast the possibility that decentralized crypto technology could enable much wider human input in the governance of AI development, and in a fairer distribution of the profits of AI, robotics and other technologies, via DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance models.\n\nWe have also pointed out that smart contracting and other decentralized crypto network and token distribution technologies could take the rewards from AI productivity out of the hands of GovTech oligarchs, issuing profits directly to humans, without the manipulations and power abuses of middle players.\n\nThe labor, knowledge, content and data of all humans have been at the core of what now exists as generative AI technology.\n\nOpenAI / Microsoft, Google, Amazon / Anthropic, Meta, X and certainly DARPA and governments, should not be ceded as the \"owners\" of AI.\n\nThe ramifications of that paradigm would be catastrophic for the continuance of natural humanity, as we have long forecast and outlined, given the premises, ideologies and ambitions of these entities.\n\nThe whole of humanity needs as wide a say in, and as wide and fair a distribution of the profits from AI, as technologically and socially possible.\n\nRight now, crypto technology contains the best promise to do that.\n\nAnd the reasons go well beyond economic and financial justice.\n\nA cabal of AI developers and overseers, whether power hungry, reckless Sam Altman, or the political suppression masters at Google and Meta, or the weapons and surveillance developers of DARPA (and their counterparts in China, Russia and the EU, etc.) are already amply showing they will use AI, and technology more generally for dystopian purposes long contemplated by philosophers and sci-fi visionaries.", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Let's dive into this phenomenon and explore its impact.\n\nWe've all been there. A new programming language gains traction, a cutting-edge framework promises to revolutionize development, or an innovative tool claims to boost productivity tenfold.\n\nIt's natural to feel excited about these advancements. After all, staying current is part of the job, but when does this pursuit of novelty become counterproductive?\n\nShiny Object Syndrome in tech isn't just about playing with new gadgets. It's a mindset that can affect your career trajectory, often leading you to invest time and energy in learning skills that may not align with your long-term goals, or your company's needs.\n\nTrends come and go at a dizzying pace. One month, everyone's talking about blockchain; the next, it's all about serverless architecture. As an employee, you can feel pressured to keep up with all the trends, fearing that you'll become obsolete if you don't.\n\nHowever, this constant shift in focus can be exhausting and counterproductive.\n\nInstead of developing deep expertise in areas that truly matter to your role and company, you might find yourself with a scattered skillset, jack of all trades but master of none.\n\nA more strategic approach would allow for deep expertise development, with a knowledge of tech trends layered on top. This can make your skillset more valuable in the long term.\n\nSpeaking of trends, let's talk about the elephant in the room: generative AI.\n\nWith tech giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft reporting record-breaking revenues due to the technology, gen AI has become the latest gold rush, and tech workers naturally feel the pressure to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nThe eye-watering salaries on offer are also pretty tempting.\n\nAccording to jobs site Indeed, the average salary potential for generative AI skills is $174,727, and these jobs are in such demand due to a widespread skills gap.\n\nWhile AI certainly holds plenty of potential, it's crucial to approach it thoughtfully. Not every role or company needs to pivot to AI immediately.\n\nThe rush to adopt AI can lead to missteps, even for established companies. Take the recent case of SheerLuxe, a luxury lifestyle platform in the UK that faced backlash for introducing an AI-generated \"editor\" named Reem.\n\nThis computer-generated image harmed the brand's entire offering of personalized recommendations, and was criticized for upholding unattainable beauty standards.\n\nMany more questioned why the company hired an agency to create an AI editor that looked to be Middle Eastern, instead of actually hiring a woman of color for the position.\n\nIn response to the controversy, SheerLuxe released a statement on Instagram explaining that Reem was created due to their desire to experiment with AI, stating that \"no jobs were compromised in any way as a result of her creation\". The whole company then took a duvet day.\n\nKhyati Sundaram, CEO of recruitment software Applied, offered valuable insights on the situation to HR Magazine:\n\n\"The reaction sparked by SheerLuxe's decision to introduce an AI employee highlights just how strongly people feel about unchecked or hastily rolled-out AI solutions.\"\n\n\"We all know that AI holds huge potential, but we also recognise that it stands to disrupt a wide range of sectors and roles. That means employers and companies have a responsibility to embrace AI mindfully and in a way that helps existing teams, rather than leaves them feeling threatened or replaced.\"\n\nThis stunt has raised questions about the thoughtful implementation of AI in various industries, and serves as a reminder of the pitfalls of rushing to adopt a technology, without considering all angles first.\n\nThe SheerLuxe controversy isn't an isolated incident either.\n\nIt followed closely on the heels of backlash against HR software company Lattice, which announced plans to allow AI agents to be treated equally to human employees on its platform, only to scrap the idea after feedback that said it \"disrespects the humanity of your real employees\".\n\nThese cases highlight the growing tension between rapid AI adoption and ethical considerations in the workplace.\n\nAvoiding Shiny Object Syndrome while still staying innovative is a challenge.\n\nWhen considering a new technology, invest time in thorough research. Understand its potential benefits, drawbacks, and ethical implications before considering if it aligns with your personal and company values and objectives.\n\nNext, engage your team in discussions about potential new technologies. Their insights can help identify which innovations are truly valuable and which might be distractions.\n\nStart with a small-scale, low-profile project if you do decide to adopt a new technology. Think of the opposite approach to Reem. Test the waters under the radar.\n\nAfter an allotted time period, evaluate its impact, and be prepared to abandon or pivot initiatives that aren't working.\n\nRemember, true innovation isn't about chasing every new trend.\n\nTaking time to pause and asking if a new technology is a valuable addition or an objectives distraction could be the difference between genuine progress, and a lot of wasted time.\n\nReady to find your next great tech job?

It enables non-technical domain experts to define, run, and share test suites for AI model bias, fairness, robustness, and accuracy.\n\nAlso Read: AiThority Interview with Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama\n\nThis capability is based on John Snow Labs' open-source LangTest library, which includes more than 100 test types for different aspects of Responsible AI, from bias and security, to toxicity and political leaning. LangTest uses Generative AI to automatically generate test cases, making it practical to produce a comprehensive set of tests in minutes instead of weeks. Created specifically for testing custom AI models, LangTest accounts for those not covered by general purpose benchmarks and leaderboards.\n\nRecent legislation in the US has made this kind of testing essential for companies looking to release new AI-based products and services, including:\n\nThe need for a comprehensive testing solution for Large Language Models (LLMs) is urgent. Yet, many domain experts lack the technical expertise to do this. Similarly, many data scientists lack the domain expertise to build comprehensive, industry- and task-specific models.

This first of a two-column series argues that AI may either increase systemic financial risk or act to stabilise the system, depending on endogenous responses, strategic complementarities, the severity of events it faces, and the objectives it is given. AI's ability to master complexity and respond rapidly to shocks means future crises will likely be more intense than those we have seen so far.\n\nBoth the private and the public financial sectors are expanding their use of artificial intelligence (AI). Because AI processes information much faster than humans, it may help cause more frequent and more intense financial crises than those we have seen so far. But it could also do the opposite and act to stabilise the system.\n\nIn Norvig and Russell's (2021) classification, we see AI as a \"rational maximising agent\". This definition resonates with the typical economic analyses of financial stability. What distinguishes AI from purely statistical modelling is that it not only uses quantitative data to provide numerical advice; it also applies goal-driven learning to train itself with qualitative and quantitative data. Thus, it can provide advice and even make decisions.\n\nIt is difficult to gauge the extent of AI use in the financial services industry. The Financial Times reports that only 6% of banks plan substantial AI use, citing concerns about its reliability, job losses, regulatory aspects, and inertia. Some surveys concur, but others differ. Finance is a highly competitive industry. When start-up financial institutions and certain large banks enjoy significant cost and efficiency improvements by using modern technology stacks and hiring staff attuned to AI, more conservative institutions probably have no choice but to follow.\n\nThe rapid adoption of AI might make the delivery of financial services more efficient while reducing costs. Most of us will benefit.\n\nBut it is not all positive. There are widespread concerns about the impact of AI on the labour market, productivity and the like (Albanesi et al. 2023, Filippucci et al. 2024). Of particular concern to us is how AI affects the potential for systemic financial crises, those disruptive events that cost the large economies trillions of dollars and upend society. This has been the focus of our recent work (Danielsson and Uthemann 2024).\n\nWe surmise that AI will not create new fundamental causes of crises but will amplify the existing ones: excessive leverage that renders financial institutions vulnerable to even small shocks; self-preservation in times of crisis that drives market participants to prefer the most liquid assets; and system opacity, complexity and asymmetric information that make market participants mistrust one another during stress. These three fundamental vulnerabilities have been behind almost every financial crisis in the past 261 years, ever since the first modern one in 1763 (Danielsson 2022).\n\nHowever, although the same three fundamental factors drive all crises, it is not easy to prevent and contain crises because they differ significantly. That is to be expected. If financial regulations are to be effective, crises should be prevented in the first place. Consequently, it is almost axiomatic that crises happen where the authorities are not looking. Since the financial system is infinitely complex, there are many areas where risk can build up.\n\nThe key to understanding financial crises lies in how financial institutions optimise - they aim to maximise profits given the acceptable risk. When translating that into how they behave operationally, Roy's (1952) criterion is useful - stated succinctly, maximising profits subject to not going bankrupt. That means financial institutions optimise for profits most of the time, perhaps 999 days out of 1,000. However, on that one last day, when great upheaval hits the system and a crisis is on the horizon, survival, rather than profit, is what they care most about -- the 'one day out of a thousand' problem.\n\nWhen financial institutions prioritise survival, their behaviour changes rapidly and drastically. They hoard liquidity and choose the most secure and liquid assets, such as central bank reserves. This leads to bank runs, fire sales, credit crunches, and all the other undesirable behaviours associated with crises. There is nothing untoward about such behaviour, but it cannot be easily regulated.\n\nThese drivers of financial instability are well understood and have always been a concern, long before the advent of computers. As technology was increasingly adopted in the financial system, it brought efficiency and benefited the system, but also amplified existing channels of instability. We expect AI to do the same.\n\nWhen identifying how this happens, it is useful to consider the societal risks arising from the use of AI (e.g. Weidinger et al. 2022, Bengio et al. 2023, Shevlane et al. 2023) and how these interact with financial stability. When doing so, we arrive at four channels in which the economy is vulnerable to AI:\n\nAI needs data to be effective, even more so than humans. That should not be an issue because the system generates plenty of data for it to work with, terabytes daily. The problem is that almost all that data comes from the middle of the distribution of system outcomes rather than from the tails. Crises are all about the tails.\n\nThere are four reasons why we have little data from the tails.\n\nThe first is the endogenous response to control by market participants; this relates to the AI misinformation channel. A helpful way to understand that is Lucas's (1976) critique and Goodhart's (1974) law: \"Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes\". Market participants do not just stoically accept regulations. No, they respond strategically. They do not tell anybody beforehand how they plan to respond to regulations and stress. They probably do not even know. Consequently, the reaction functions of market participants are hidden. And something that is hidden is not in a dataset.\n\nThe second reason, which follows from the malicious channel, is all the strategic complementarities that are at the heart of how market participants behave during crises. They feel compelled to withdraw liquidity because their competitors are doing so. Meanwhile, strategic complementarities can lead to multiple equilibria, where wildly different market outcomes might result from random chance. Both these consequences of strategic complementarities mean that observations of past crises are not all that informative for future ones. This is another reason we do not have many observations from the tails.\n\nAt the root of the problem are two characteristics of AI: it excels at extracting complex patterns from data, and it quickly learns from the environment in which it operates. Current AI engines observe what the competitors do, and it would not be difficult for them to use those observations to improve their own models of how the world works. What this means in practice is that future AI in private firms and public organisations train, and hence optimise, to influence one another.\n\nAligning the incentives of AI with those of its owner is a hard problem - the misalignment channel. It can get worse during crises, when speed is of the essence and there might be no time for the AI to elicit human feedback to fine-tune objectives. The traditional way the system acts to prevent run equilibria might not work anymore. The ever-present misalignment problem between individually rational behaviour and socially desirable outcomes might be exacerbated if human regulators can no longer coordinate rescue efforts and 'twist arms'. AI might have already liquidated their positions, and hence caused a crisis, before the human owner can pick up the phone to answer the call of the Fed chair.\n\nAI will probably exacerbate the oligopolistic market structure channel for financial instability, further strengthened by the oligopolistic nature of the AI analytics business. As financial institutions come to see and react to the world in increasingly similar ways, they coordinate in buying and selling, leading to bubbles and crashes. More generally, risk monoculture is an important driver of booms and busts in the financial system. Machine learning design, input data and compute affect the ability of AI engines to manage risk. These are increasingly controlled mainly by a few technology and information companies, which continue to merge, leading to an oligopolistic market.\n\nThe main concern from this market concentration is the likelihood that many financial institutions, including those in the public sector, get their view of the world from the same vendor. That implies that they will see opportunities and risk similarly, including how those are affected by current or hypothetical stress. In crises, this homogenising effect of AI use can reduce strategic uncertainty and facilitate coordination on run equilibria.\n\nGiven the recent wave of data vendor mergers, it is a concern that neither the competition authorities nor the financial authorities appear to have fully appreciated the potential for increased systemic risk that could arise from oligopolistic AI technology.\n\nIf faced with existential threats to the institution, AI optimises for survival. But it is here that the very speed and efficiency of AI works against the system. If other financial institutions do the same, they coordinate on a crisis equilibrium. So, all the institutions affect one another because they collectively make the same decision. They all try to react as quickly as possible, as the first to dispose of risky assets is best placed to weather the storm.\n\nThe consequence is increased uncertainty, leading to extreme market volatility, as well as vicious feedback loops, such as fire sales, liquidity withdrawals and bank runs. Thanks to AI, stress that might have taken days or weeks to unfold can now happen in minutes or hours.\n\nThe AI engine might also do the opposite. After all, just because AI can react faster does not mean it will. Empirical evidence suggests that, although asset prices might fall below fundamental values in a crisis, they often recover quickly. That means buying opportunities. If the AI is not that concerned about survival and the engines converge on a recovery equilibrium in aggregate, they will absorb the shock and no crisis will ensue.\n\nTaken together, we surmise that AI will act to lower volatility and fatten the tails. It could smooth out short-term fluctuations at the expense of more extreme events.\n\nOf particular importance is how prepared the financial authorities are for an AI crisis. We discuss this in a VoxEU piece appearing next week, titled \"How the financial authorities can respond to AI threats to financial stability\".\n\nAuthors' note: Any opinions and conclusions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Bank of Canada.\n\nAlbanesi, S, A Dias da Silva, J F Jimeno, A Lamo and A Wabitsch (2023), \"Artificial intelligence and jobs: Evidence from Europe\", VoxEU.org, 29 July.\n\nBengio, Y, G Hinton, A Yao et al.

Learn more today!\n\nThe growing use of artificial intelligence in the workplace is fueling a rapid increase in data consumption, challenging the corporate ability to safeguard sensitive data.\n\nA report released in May from data security firm Cyberhaven, titled \"The Cubicle Culprits,\" sheds light on AI adoption trends and their correlation to heightened risk. Cyberhaven's analysis drew on a dataset of usage patterns from three million workers to assess AI adoption and its implications in the corporate environment.\n\nThe rapid rise of AI mimics previous transformative shifts, such as the internet and cloud computing. Just as early cloud adopters navigated new challenges, today's companies must contend with the complexities introduced by widespread AI adoption, according to Cyberhaven CEO Howard Ting.\n\n\"Our research on AI usage and risks not only highlights the impact of these technologies but also underscores the emerging risks that could parallel those encountered during significant technological upheavals in the past,\" he told TechNewsWorld.\n\nThe Cubicle Culprits report reveals the rapid acceleration of AI adoption in the workplace and use by end users that outpaces corporate IT. This trend, in turn, fuels risky \"shadow AI\" accounts, including more types of sensitive company data.\n\nProducts from three AI tech giants -- OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft -- dominate AI usage. Their products account for 96% of AI usage at work.\n\nAccording to the research, workers worldwide entered sensitive corporate data into AI tools, increasing by an alarming 485% from March 2023 to March 2024. We are still early in the adoption curve. Only 4.7% of employees at financial firms, 2.8% in pharma and life sciences, and 0.6% at manufacturing firms use AI tools.\n\nA significant 73.8% of ChatGPT usage at work occurs through non-corporate accounts. Unlike enterprise versions, these accounts incorporate shared data into public models, posing a considerable risk to sensitive data security,\" warned Ting.\n\n\"A substantial portion of sensitive corporate data is being sent to non-corporate accounts. This includes roughly half of the source code [50.8%], research and development materials [55.3%], and HR and employee records [49.0%],\" he said.\n\nData shared through these non-corporate accounts are incorporated into public models. The percentage of non-corporate account usage is even higher for Gemini (94.4%) and Bard (95.9%).\n\nThis trend indicates a critical vulnerability. Ting said that non-corporate accounts lack the robust security measures to protect such data.\n\nAI adoption rates are rapidly reaching new departments and use cases involving sensitive data. Some 27% of data that employees put into AI tools is sensitive, up from 10.7% a year ago.\n\nFor example, 82.8% of legal documents employees put into AI tools went to non-corporate accounts, potentially exposing the information publicly.\n\nTing cautioned that including patented material in content generated by AI tools poses increasing risks. Source code insertions generated by AI outside of coding tools can create the risk of vulnerabilities.\n\nSome companies are clueless about stopping the flow of unauthorized and sensitive data exported to AI tools beyond IT's reach. They rely on existing data security tools that only scan the data's content to identify its type.\n\n\"What's been missing is the context of where the data came from, who interacted with it, and where it was stored. Consider the example of an employee pasting code into a personal AI account to help debug it,\" offered Ting. \"Is it source code from a repository? Is it customer data from a SaaS application?\"\n\nEducating workers about the data leakage problem is a viable part of the solution if done correctly, assured Ting. Most companies have rolled out periodic security awareness training.\n\n\"However, the videos workers have to watch twice a year are soon forgotten. The education that works best is correcting bad behavior immediately in the moment,\" he offered.\n\nCyberhaven found that when workers receive a popup message coaching them during risky activities, like pasting source code into a personal ChatGPT account, ongoing bad behavior decreases by 90%,\" said Ting.\n\nHis company's technology, Data Detection and Response (DDR) understands how data moves and uses that context to protect sensitive data. The technology also understands the difference between a corporate and personal account for ChatGPT.\n\nThis capability enables companies to enforce a policy that blocks employees from pasting sensitive data into personal accounts while allowing that data to flow to enterprise accounts.\n\nCyberhaven analyzed the prevalence of insider risks based on workplace arrangements, including remote, onsite, and hybrid. Researchers found that a worker's location impacts the data spread when a security incident occurs.\n\n\"Our research uncovered a surprising twist in the narrative. In-office employees, traditionally considered the safest bet, are now leading the charge in corporate data exfiltration,\" he revealed.\n\nCounterintuitively, office-based workers are 77% more likely than their remote counterparts to exfiltrate sensitive data. However, when office-based workers log in from offsite, they are 510% more likely to exfiltrate data than when onsite, making this the riskiest time for corporate data, according to Ting.", "source": {"uri": "technewsworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechNewsWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Cincinnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Source code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards_and_Protocols", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Standards and Protocols", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.technewsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/systems-control-operators.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Similar to the GDPR and other laws being part of the EU Digital Strategy, the AI Act foresees the possibility of the competent authorities to impose severe fines based on the offender's total worldwide annual group turnover. It therefore establishes penalty frameworks for AI systems and general-purpose AI models (GPAI models).\n\nPenalty framework for AI systems\n\nAs the rules applicable to AI systems will be enforced by to be designated market surveillance authorities of the EU Member States (for more information see our blog on the regulators of the AI Act), each EU Member State is also required to establish a penalty system with regard to these rules. Such national penalty systems must be notified to the European Commission as soon as possible - at the latest by the date of entry into application from 2 August 2026. These penalties should be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive, respecting the ne bis in idem principle to prevent double prosecution for the same offence.\n\nWhile, in principle, the AI Act thereby provides for the establishment of a fully decentral penalty framework for AI systems, it nevertheless includes explicit conditions for administrative fines with regards to infringements of certain provisions of the AI Act. These conditions aim to harmonise the amount of imposed administrative fines across the EU, in particular by defining the following upper fine limits:\n\nIn addition, the AI Act harmonises the criteria to determine the amount of an administrative fine. These criteria include, among others, the nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement, the intentional or negligent character of the violation, and the financial capacity of the entity. Also, the degree of cooperation with authorities, and any previous infringements can be considered. Each individual case will be assessed based on these and other relevant circumstances. Despite this harmonised set of criteria, regulators will likely have considerable discretion in justifying individual fines. The lack of foreseeability of fine amounts across the EU could create uncertainty for all stakeholders in the AI system value chain potentially becoming subject to fines.\n\nPenalty framework for GPAI models\n\nContrary to the rules on AI systems, the rules on GPAI models are subject to the oversight of the Commission and therefore not in the hands of the EU Member States. The Commission has exclusive powers to supervise and enforce obligations concerning GPAI models, whereas it shall entrust the implementation of its tasks to the AI Office. Also, a scientific panel of independent experts can advise and support the AI Office, in particular by providing alerts where it has reason to suspect that a GPAI model poses a systemic risk (for more information see our blog on the regulators of the AI Act).\n\nIn line with the approach of central enforcement regarding the obligations applicable to GPAI models, the AI Act establishes a corresponding central penalty framework for GPAI models by setting out administrative fines for providers of GPAI models. Specifically, the Commission can impose fines of up to EUR 15 million or 3% of the total annual worldwide group turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Such fines can be issued where a GPAI model provider intentionally or negligently:\n\nWhen determining the amount of an administrative fine, the Commission shall consider various criteria, including any commitments made by the provider to implement mitigation measures. Compared to the criteria for imposing fines on the operators of AI systems, the criteria to be considered by the Commission under the AI Act are less detailed, making predictions of fine amounts less predictable to a certain extent. However, before imposing fines, the Commission is required to communicate preliminary findings to the provider and shall offer an opportunity for the provider to be heard. Also, the Commission will adopt implementing acts on procedural safeguards for proceedings in relation to such fines. The CJEU has unlimited jurisdiction to review the Commission's decisions on fines, including the power to cancel, reduce, or increase the fines imposed.\n\nIn our next blog post, we will take a look at some of the most well-known international soft law approaches to regulate AI.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court of Justice of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

They have the potential to benefit both insurers and consumers by speeding up insurance processes.\n\nHowever, AI also absorbs biases that exists in data, which can influence its predictions and decisions. Those biases could result in unfair discrimination or inequality.\n\nDepartment of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris said in a July 11 news release that the final guidelines are designed to prevent unlawful discrimination in insurance processes that incorporate the technology in calculations, while maintaining the \"stability of the marketplace.\"\n\nThe new provisions apply to any insurer authorized to write policies in the state, whether they offer medical, property or casualty coverage plans.\n\nThe guidelines add on to Gov. Kathy Hochul's Empire AI initiative that sparked the state's information technology services office to establish policies for agencies looking to adopt artificial intelligence systems. Those policies, similar to the guidelines for insurers, emphasize using new technology to improve New Yorkers' experiences while remaining vigilant about the risks posed by AI systems, with any final decisions being made by human staff.\n\nArtificial intelligence systems covered by the guidelines, according to the guidance from the Department of Financial Services earlier this month, are defined as those that use \"reasoning, learning and self-improvement\" that are used to \"supplement traditional health, life, property or casualty underwriting or pricing,\" or are used as a proxy for traditional processes.\n\nGuidelines for external consumer data and information sources are also included in the directive. These sources are any alternative data that insurers use in addition to traditional medical, property or casualty pricing factors.\n\nAlbany-based provider Capital District Physicians' Health Plan said they do not use AI in underwriting or pricing practices; however, any future use would ensure the fair collection of data.\n\n\"CDPHP is committed to furthering innovation in our business, and we take seriously the responsibility of using powerful tools such as artificial intelligence,\" said Natalia Burkart, a spokeswoman for the not-for-profit health plan.\n\nAllison Koenecke, an information science professor at Cornell University, which is part of the Empire AI consortium, said there has been some discussion about the vagueness of the word \"unfair.\"\n\nKoenecke, who studies fairness in algorithmic systems, explained that while ensuring the testing of systems is a \"step in the right direction,\" there are multiple different interpretations of the word.\n\n\"There are many different definitions of fairness, and mostly, unless you have certain mathematical constraints imposed, you cannot satisfy multiple definitions of fairness at once,\" Koenecke told the Times Union. \"It's important to clearly define both what the definition of fairness is that each use case is interested in, and also why that's the case.\"\n\nThe Department of Financial Services' letter acknowledges those concerns, referring to definitions of \"unfair\" and \"unlawful\" used in state and federal laws.\n\nKoenecke's comments on the guidance mentioned a similar law put in place in New York City last year that asks employers who plan to use automated systems in the hiring process to disclose how AI is used and to audit those systems annually.\n\nThe New York City law was the first of its kind and has not had the effects that lawmakers intended. While seeking to root out potential biases, compliance with the law has been low, due to employers' flexibility to claim that their systems are not AI. According to a study at Cornell University, only 18 out of 391 employers have published their audit reports.\n\nOfficials with MVP Health Care, a Schenectady-based firm that provides coverage to New York and Vermont residents, said they are aware of the updated guidelines and will make \"any changes necessary to comply.\" MVP did not immediately respond to whether they have used or will use AI systems in pricing or underwriting.\n\nHochul announced the appropriation of more than $400 million toward research under Empire AI in January, an effort that would put N.Y. at the \"forefront\" of AI development. The industry is expected to grow to be a $1.3 trillion-a-year industry by 2030, according to the governor.\n\nAccording to Mayer Brown, an international law firm, as of June 30, there were 12 states, as well as the District of Columbia, that have adopted similar preventative measures.\n\nPart of the state's plan addresses third-party vendors, with carriers responsible for understanding and mitigating the potential disparities caused by external data sources. Firms that create and sell their own models are also subject to the guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines are only meant to address the use of AI and alternative data in underwriting and pricing in insurance offices -- they do not dictate how AI systems can be used in other sectors, including marketing.", "source": {"uri": "timesunion.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Union"}, "authors": [],

The first source said that the memo will likely include a short list of \"prohibited uses\" of AI systems, such as leveraging it to operate nuclear weapons and tracking constitutionally protected activity, like free speech.\n\n\"High impact\" use cases of AI will also be outlined in the memo. Examples of high impact AI deployment will likely include risky scenarios -- such as real-time biometric tracking and identifying individuals as threats to national security -- that are not prohibited, but demand greater oversight.\n\n\"Those high impact uses will be subject to various governance and risk management practices that will be similar to those in the OMB memo, though depart from them in some ways,\" the first source said.\n\nAlthough the memo will be initially classified, the Biden administration is angling to declassify as much as it can for broader accessibility at a later date, the second source familiar with the memo said.\n\nExperts in the national security field note that this memorandum is important in setting a tone for how the government will respond to both risks and advantages offered by AI technologies.\n\n\"What you're looking at here are government capabilities that really affect fundamental freedoms and rights: who they decide to investigate, who they decide to surveil, who they allow to come into the country, who they designated as a national security or public safety threat. So these are things that are really important to individuals and really affect their lives,\" Faiza Patel, co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program within New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, told Nextgov/FCW. \"So I think it's an incredibly high-stakes document which hasn't gotten as much attention, I think, as some of the other AI work.\"\n\nPatel noted that within national security organizations, internal mechanisms are often needed to enforce the implementation of safeguards. She said that bringing in more robust external oversight to ensure the safe deployment of AI technologies stands to be helpful in federal agencies working to preserve civil liberties alongside AI integration.\n\n\"I would be pleased to see strong guardrails for high-risk systems. I would be pleased to see a robust list of high-risk systems, but I do question whether there are effective mechanisms inside the government to make sure whether those rules and safeguards are actually being followed,\" Patel said.", "source": {"uri": "nextgov.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nextgov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Memorandum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bletchley Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office of Management and Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennan_Center_for_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brennan Center for Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Safety_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Safety and Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Exploits", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Exploits", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/cd/2024/07/25/072524_getty_ng_biden_ai/860x394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6313725490196078, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

While the new technology has progressively integrated its way into the collective consciousness, many tax and accounting professionals a remain unsure of how it will directly affect their day-to-day work.\n\nThey found that 50% of practitioners were either \"hesitant\" (which was the most common response overall) or \"concerned\" about generative AI. In contrast, 47% were either \"hopeful\" or \"excited.\" Only 3% were actively \"fearful.\" This shows that while there is a lot of enthusiasm about generative AI, there is also a lot of doubt.\n\nThose who were more enthusiastic cited reasons such as new opportunities for productivity and efficiency gains, business growth, streamlining work processes, and the potential transformation of the industry as a whole. Conversely, those who were less enthusiastic primarily pointed to the potential to exploit GenAI for unethical or fraudulent purposes. Others were concerned about an over-reliance on GenAI within the tax industry and concerns around job displacement.\n\nRegardless of their stance, however, 73% of tax professionals overall said generative AI can be applied to tax work, with only 5% saying it can't. At the same time, however, when asked whether generative AI should be applied to tax work, 52% said yes and 18% said no, indicating that while many recognize that theoretically the technology could be used, less are convinced it ought to.\n\nThe survey also found that firms have been a little slow to adopt these tools generally. Only 10% of respondents said their organization already uses generative AI firm-wide, with an additional 13% planning to in the future. Conversely, a full 49% have no plans to deploy generative AI and 27% are still weighing their options. For those who do use generative AI, the most common use cases, both at 84%, were \"accounting/bookkeeping\" and \"tax research.\" Tax return preparation was third, at 69%.\n\nThis slowness could be due to lack of input from clients. A full 82% of firms said clients have provided no direction one way or another on the use of generative AI versus the 1% whose clients want them to use more of it and 2% whose clients want them to use less of it. Results were similar for corporate accountants when it comes to requests from firms to use generative AI.\n\n\"Perhaps because of this seeming lack of urgency from clients, tax & accounting firms are largely hands-off in guiding GenAI use internally,\" said Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe poll also found that tax professionals believe that the use of generative AI means they will be able to charge higher rates: 2% said it would be significant and 38% said it would be slight. In contrast, only 6% thought rates would decrease. Similarly, 29% plan to pass on the costs of generative AI investments to customers across the board, and 27% plan to do so on a case by case basis. Just 27% said they would absorb the costs themselves.", "source": {"uri": "accountingtoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Accounting Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookkeeping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9379a39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7253x4080+13+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F0d%2F9e%2F15d48d704595911d7e12931fa51c%2Fadobestock-754442580.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

However, a central challenge is to create agile regulations that address risks and harms related to these novel technologies.\n\nRole of AI in space and satellite technology\n\nThe integration of AI into space and satellite technology offers a range of opportunities for commercial and exploratory space activities. Some examples of these applications include the following:\n\nMany of the technologies have the potential to be adopted terrestrially to manage space activities (e.g., from operation centres), as well as in space (i.e., in situ) as the technology advances. For example, AI-enabled data processing and selection could be deployed in situ to reduce the latency and cost involved with transmitting data to Earth.\n\nRegulation at an international and EU level\n\nAt the international level, space activities are governed by four core United Nations space treaties which underpin the international framework for the use and exploration of space, responsibility of States and liability for space objects: the Outer Space Treaty, the Rescue Agreement, the Liability Convention, and the Registration Convention. Many States have adopted national space laws that incorporate these international rules and may establish a framework for regulating national space activities.\n\nThe international space treaties do not address the use of AI in space or for space missions, particularly because these treaties were agreed well before commercially available AI technology. Similarly, we are not yet aware of any AI-specific regulations in any national space laws. However, as space technology evolves, many of these national space laws are being reviewed and developed to accommodate new technology, which may include AI considerations.\n\nAdditionally, general AI regulatory developments may also impact the space and satellite sector, including the EU AI Act. Space and satellite systems that incorporate AI technology may fall within the high-risk category of the EU AI Act, depending on the use of the system (e.g., global navigation satellite systems that support EU emergency services may fall within scope where they incorporate AI systems for key functions like manoeuvring). Similarly, there may be considerations around personal data processing where AI enabled satellite systems collect imagery of the EU or are operated from the EU.\n\nOther developments\n\nOther countries are also taking steps to regulate AI which may impact the space and satellite sector, including the UK, the U.S. and various APAC countries. These are at varying levels of maturity and the relevance of these regimes to the space and satellite sector will depend on their finalised scope.\n\nMore specifically for space and satellite activities, NASA has released a Framework for the Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence which outlines key principles to guide NASA's use of AI and intends to provide guidance to industry more broadly. Similarly, we may see further guidance develop in the space and satellite sector to address AI regulation at the national level but also the international level, particularly where there may be intersections with existing guidance (e.g. the Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines and the Long-Term Sustainability Guidelines).\n\nWhat's next?\n\nWhen considering the use of AI in the space and satellite sector moving forward, some of the questions that may need to be considered include the following:\n\nThe opportunity to leverage AI in the space and satellite sector is clear but the sector will need to navigate the current regulatory uncertainty and consider issues like those discussed above as the regulatory landscape evolves.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Registration Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rescue Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_space_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outline of space technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Liability_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Liability Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outer Space Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space debris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Satellite", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761468", "eventUri": "eng-9761468", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

The state's governor signed a law on Thursday that will offer up to $500 million in tax credits for artificial intelligence companies to set up shop in the state.\n\n\"We want New Jerseyans to stand at the forefront of the AI revolution -- and build a more prosperous world in the process,\" New Jersey's Governor, Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said in a statement. \"And in so doing, we are going to establish New Jersey as the home-base for R&D in generative AI.\"\n\nAI companies and data centers that power AI that operate at large scales in New Jersey can qualify for the tax credits, which divert unspent funds from two other state tax credit programs for job creation and real estate development enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCritics of the plan fear that it could be a win for profitable AI companies, but a loss for the state. Data centers typically require few employees, and tax incentives generally -- including those thrown at tech companies -- can prove costlier than what they return. In an analysis of the bill, New Jersey's Office of Legislative Services, an agency in the state legislature that provides nonpartisan support, notes that it \"cannot determine whether the bill will have a positive or negative net fiscal impact\" on the state.\n\nThe tax credits follow Murphy's \"AI Moonshot'' vision for New Jersey, announced early this year. Murphy has said he intended for the state's actions to \"establish New Jersey as the home base for AI-powered game-changers.\"\n\nNew Jersey's own homegrown CoreWeave, a cloud provider for AI, recently raised $1.1 billion and is valued at $19 billion. And the state could multiply its market by capitalizing on the growing demand for data centers in the New York area: Vacancies for leased locations dropped from 9.7 percent to 6.5 percent from the beginning of 2023 to the second half of the year, according to a report from commercial real estate firm CBRE. The report also noted that an AI company has pre-leased space in East Windsor, a New Jersey town between New York and Philadelphia.\n\nAnd AI businesses are driving a surge in venture capital funding. These highly profitable companies need data centers to do business, and will put them somewhere -- and they won't need incentives to do it. \"This is a growing, very healthy industry that does need any public support to do its business,\" says Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a US national policy resource center that promotes corporate and government accountability in economic development.\n\nData centers and companies working in AI are often eligible for general business tax incentives in the US. But those data center tax credits are \"not particularly strategic,\" says Tim Sullivan, CEO of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.\n\nNew Jersey's plan is different from other states, he contends, because companies that benefit from the tax credit will have to reserve some computing power at discounted rates or provide AI support for smaller companies or universities. And while property in New Jersey isn't cheap (it has the highest corporate tax rate in the US), proximity to large populations is highly valuable to data centers. Opening the sites closer to businesses helps to lower latency.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9

In Europe, too, startups such as France's Mistral have entered the race.\n\nThe opportunity is for the Middle East to join this league and make sure its voice is heard.\n\nInspired by my latest trip to Riyadh, I decided to test how the current crop of AI models would handle a simple request. I imagined myself as a young Saudi getting ready to host a dinner party and asked ChatGPT to prepare a menu.\n\nThe food it recommended sounded delicious -- stuffed grape leaves, tabouleh salad, mandi and stuffed dates. But the beverages were a problem.\n\nAside from drinks such as mint lemonade and jallab, a mixture of dates, grape molasses and rose water, ChatGPT also offered this: \"For alcoholic beverages, you could offer a selection of international wines, beers, or non-alcoholic mocktails.\"\n\nTo its credit, when I repeated the question, it offered only non-alcoholic drinks.\n\nIf a model recommends breaking both the law and cultural norms, imagine how it might answer other more sensitive questions about politics or religion? Indeed, researchers have even shown that some models have exhibited an anti-Muslim bias.\n\nMy modest test underlines the urgent need to develop an Arabic large language model that reflects local values.\n\nThe first step to building this is creating enough high-quality Arabic digitized data to properly train a new generation of models.\n\nAlthough there are 400 million Arabic speakers, only an estimated 2 percent of online content is in Arabic. Meta's open source LLM model Llama is overwhelmingly trained on English data, with Arabic comprising less than 0.1 percent of the data.\n\nThe lack of data naturally skews the results. To fix this dearth of data, either a visionary entrepreneur or a government-backed organization should collect, digitize and convert the many Arabic books into training data for Arabic models.\n\nOnce the data is gathered, it can be fed into the breakthrough pre-training process, which reads trillions of words and creates its own virtual concept space or model of the world. This concept space has been shown to be mostly in English and Chinese.\n\nAdding a sizable number of texts in Arabic, which has enormous cultural output and significance, will make the concept space more knowledgeable about Arabic and more balanced in its concepts and views.\n\nAfter such pre-training, the model needs to be fine-tuned by data and labels from the Arab world, which will align with the values of the region. Those are different from American models, which are aligned to US values, and Chinese models, which reflect Chinese values.\n\nThe collection of alignment data, the coordination of human labeling and the alignment process will need to be done in-region by AI experts.\n\nA new Arabic-enhanced large language model could encourage entrepreneurs and developers to build new applications tailored to the needs of their nations.\n\nKai-fu Lee\n\nFinally, safety modules will need to be added to ensure legal compliance and to avoid harm. These will also need to be developed locally.\n\nThe above steps will create localized, sovereign models that will reflect the traditions of the Middle East. Privately developed or government-backed, it could be the foundation for a new wave of Arabic AI innovation.\n\nA new Arabic-enhanced large language model could encourage entrepreneurs and developers to build new applications tailored to the needs of their nations.\n\nImagine an AI tool that could find, summarize, organize and write insightful content, an AI teacher that makes learning fun and customized, an AI doctor that is more knowledgeable than any human, an AI engineer that can write software and applications, and an AI assistant that knows its owner better than the owner themselves.\n\nThe Arab world did not play a leading role in the PC, internet and mobile eras. In the AI era, it will be different.\n\nThis transformation is by no means an easy feat. It will require an unprecedented investment of money, energy and human capital.\n\nMiddle Eastern leaders like Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and others have shown that they have the vision, determination and resources to lead their countries into the future.\n\nStanding on my hotel balcony in Jeddah recently, overlooking the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, I saw part of that vision coming to fruition.\n\nUniversities such as KAUST and the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in the UAE are striking examples of the resources that have already been poured into this transformation.\n\nThese world-class academic institutions can attract and retain the best top tier global talent. \u202fIt is especially important to bring in the world's best computer engineers to help fulfill this vision of the future AI.\n\nOur team at 01.AI has shown what a group of talented and motivated computer scientists can achieve in just one year. With the right commitment of resources and drawing upon the best talent, countries like Saudi Arabia can easily catch up with their global peers.\n\nThe Middle East can also lead the world in the use of renewables to run power-hungry generative AI models.\n\nAs it seeks to diversify its economy, Saudi Arabia is actively promoting the use of alternative energy sources such as solar, which could power server farms and reduce their carbon footprint -- a growing concern as AI becomes more widespread.\n\nIt may take time for countries to figure out their strategy for building a sovereign AI. But it is critical for the Arab world to quickly catalyze the creation of culturally appropriate LLMs and build a rich ecosystem to allow AI-powered Arabic apps to blossom.\n\nA recent encounter with a female sales assistant at a computer store in Riyadh served as an apt reminder of what is at stake. Dressed in jeans and sporting a tattoo, she was a reminder of the transformative changes that the country is undergoing.\n\nWhere are you from, I asked. \"I'm Saudi,\" she said. \"One day I want to be Saudi Arabia's Elon Musk.\" I hope on my next visit she will pitch me a homegrown AI app.\n\n* Kai-Fu Lee is a computer scientist, CEO of 01.AI, chairman of Sinovation Ventures, former president of

Ben Wyatt moving on from Nedlands mansion only a couple of years after buying it for $3.69m Kim MacdonaldThe West Australian June 29, 2024 1:46PM Comments TopicsPropertyHousing MarketWA News Former State treasurer Ben Wyatt must have got used to a week being a long time back when he was in politics, considering he is selling his Nedlands home only two years after buying it. The first two years at a new home feels like the honeymoon stage for most buyers, but Wyatt is already set to move on, seeking offers on the four-bedroom home he bought for $3.69 million home in May 2022.

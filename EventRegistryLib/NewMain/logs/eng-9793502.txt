Others were receiving results by post or by text.\n\nThe SQA has had a team of 7,400 markers grading about two million exam papers and more than 1.3million items of coursework submitted as part of the process.\n\nCertificates were sent out to candidates across Scotland by first class post, but about 58,000 students also signed up to be notified of grades via text or email.\n\nThe email began by simply saying: 'Dear Candidate, Your 2024 results are:'\n\nStudents in Scotland were today sent blank emails instead of grades, like the one above\n\nIt continued: 'If you have any questions about your results, please speak to your school, college or training provider, who can give advice on your options.

Yours sincerely, Fiona Robertson, SQA chief executive, and Scotland's chief examining officer.'\n\nScottish Tory education spokesperson Liam Kerr MSP blasted the 'shambolic situation' as he blamed the Scottish government and SQA for the blank emails.\n\nHe told BBC News: 'This chaotic and shambolic situation is the last thing pupils across Scotland needed on results day. Receiving a blank email will have only added to pupils' worries about how they did in their exams.\n\n'Successive SNP education secretaries have dithered and delayed on reforming the SQA for too long. Even then their plans amount to a sticking plaster rather than the widespread changes that Scottish education requires.'\n\nThe SQA said on X: 'We are working urgently to resolve the issue. Texts are not impacted and the vast majority of learners who signed up to MySQA are receiving their results as expected.\n\n'All learners across Scotland will also receive their physical certificate today via post.'\n\nThe email was signed by Scottish Qualifications Authority chief executive Fiona Robertson\n\nIt later confirmed it had resolved the problem, saying: 'We have resolved a technical issue that impacted candidates who signed up to receive their results by email only using the MySQA service.\n\nRead More So much for equality!

But whether students receive the results they were expecting or if things turn out a bit better or worse, it can be confusing when the adrenaline wears down and parents and young people begin to think seriously about the question: What next?\n\nThere is no shortage of resources available for students on Results Day. The SQA offers advice and guidance on understanding how results were calculated, how the appeals process works, and who to call with questions or problems.\n\nTo help manage the mental and emotional strain of Results Day, support hubs and helplines are open all day on Results Day, and many will take calls throughout the week.\n\nHere is a quick look at some resources that could be useful to young people this week.\n\nStudents should receive their official results from the SQA on Tuesday 6 August. Anyone who elected to receive results by text message or email should receive a message after 8am on Results Day. The SQA advises that delivery can vary depending on service providers and to be sure to check spam and junk folders for the message.\n\nResults arriving by post should be at your door on Tuesday. If you receive your post and the SQA certificate is missing, your first call should be to your school, college or course provider.\n\nFor students headed to college or university, even if their results meet the conditions of an offer, taking the next steps can still be confusing. Institutions will contact you with more information once your place has been confirmed, and you will see that your application status has been updated.\n\nColleges and universities may still need further information, so check the UCAS Hub for instructions.\n\nIf results aren't as expected or don't meet the conditions of an offer, there are still options available.\n\nColleges and universities may still accept students who don't meet the conditions of the original offer or offer them a place in another course. Acceptance can sometimes depend on other students' results, and institutions may need a few days to know how many spaces are available.\n\nFor expert and impartial advice on what to do next, regardless of your results, the Skills Development Scotland Results Helpline will be live from Tuesday morning at 8am.\n\nThe helpline has provided crucial support in past years for students whose results were not what they expected. But organisers also told The Herald that they can provide guidance for students who may have done better than expected or simply want to ensure they keep all of their options open.\n\nRuth Scott, SDS helpline team leader, said that expert support staff are trained to handle questions about every aspect of Results Day and the next steps for students.\n\n\"We have lots of information about clearing courses, SQA results and the certificate, and what the grades mean. We work closely with partners like SQA and UCAS to offer that help, but we also have an additional layer of support about actually making an informed career decision and helping people to find not just 'clutching at straws' option, but asking what is the best option for them?\"\n\nSDS has also published a list of Frequently Asked Questions for tips on various scenarios related to admissions and Results Day.\n\nFor students who don't feel that their results are correct, the SQA free appeals service is available starting Tuesday morning. The appeals process will ensure that your assessments were fully marked, in line with national standards, marks were tallied correctly and that the correct results were entered.\n\nImportantly, appeals will not consider any other coursework or alternative evidence from teachers and are not a re-marking of the SQA assessment.\n\nThe appeals service opens at 9 a.m. on Tuesday 6 August. Depending on whether appeals qualify as a priority (meaning the results will impact a conditional offer or if training or employment depends on the grade), there are two deadlines for submission.\n\nDeadlines are:\n\nDecisions on priority appeals should be returned by September 2, and all other appeals will be returned beginning in October.\n\nYou can access the appeals service online via the SQA website. The SQA advises students who plan to appeal to notify their school, college, or training provider.\n\nFor questions relating to the SQA results specifically, a helpline will be open from 8am - 6pm on Tuesday 6 August, and from 8:30am - 5pm on Wednesday 7 August to Friday 9 August.\n\nThe SQA Candidate Advice Line: 0345 279 1000\n\nFor questions about applications or placements for college or university, contact UCAS at 0371 468 0468 between 8:30am to 6pm on weekdays.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Herald_(Glasgow)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Herald (Glasgow)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skills_Development_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skills Development Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCAS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UCAS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/17064496/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 848, "textEnd": 856, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 4412, "textEnd": 4420}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 4431, "textEnd": 4439}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-02", "textStart": 4023, "textEnd": 4034}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

with the pass rate at Higher levels falling back to pre-Covid levels.\n\nThis year's results showed that 77.2 per cent of those sitting National 5 exams passed with grades A to C - this is down from 78.8 per cet in 2023.\n\nFor Highers, 74.9 per cent of students passed with the top bands, down from 77.1 per cent last year.\n\nFor Advanced Highers, 75.3 per cent of students achieved A to C grades, falling from 79.8 per cent in 2023.\n\nHowever, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) stressed \"significant caution\" should be exercised when comparing results.\n\nThis is because changes during and after the coronavirus pandemic mean that different approaches have been used in awarding exams every year since 2019.\n\nThe Scottish Government said the results showed the impact of the poverty-related attainment gap, which has been described as an \"all-time high\".\n\nThey stated that results were \"broadly similar\" to 2019 - the last year of pre-pandemic results.\n\nEducation Secretary Jenny Gilruth said also that the recovery from the pandemic would have \"contributed to some of the variability we have seen in results this year\".\n\nShe spoke as some 145,000 students across Scotland - the highest number since 2015 - received their results this morning.\n\nHowever, a technical glitch saw 7,000 students who had signed up to be notified by email receive blank results messages.\n\nParents and students alike blasted the exam body for the error, saying it added anxiousness to an already \"stressful enough\" day.\n\nScottish Labour Education spokesperson Pam Duncan-Glancy hit out at the \"chaotic\" situation, adding that it was \"simply unacceptable\".\n\nShe said: \"Young people across Scotland should have woken up this morning to exciting news - instead they have woken up to a new level of SQA chaos.\n\n\"It is simply unacceptable that thousands of young people have been forced to undergo real anxiety due to this SQA technical failure.\n\n\"The results speak for themselves - the poverty-related attainment gap is at its highest ever level, while attainment has also fallen for all.\n\n\"Higher pass rates are equal to the lowest level on record and pass rates are well below the pre-pandemic standard.\n\n\"Despite the best efforts of teachers, staff and Scotland's young people, they are being forced to pay the price of 17 years of SNP failure and SQA chaos.\n\n\"Young people in Scotland have been badly let down and the First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary cannot avoid responsibility.\"\n\nSQA bosses said later they had resolved the issue - with a spokesperson stressing text results were not impacted and the \"vast majority of learners\" had received their results as expected.\n\nFiona Robertson, SQA chief executive, and Scotland's chief examining officer, said that overall \"while there is some variability in the national attainment picture in 2024, this is a solid set of results for learners in National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses\".\n\nIt comes as it was revealed that future exams could be set for a major shake-up, with changes to the current exams expected to be rolled out in the early days of next term.\n\nReforms to Scotland's exams system will be revealed in the coming weeks, Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has said.\n\nThe Scottish Government took the decision to overhaul the system with the SQA to be replaced by Qualifications Scotland.\n\nSpeaking as pupils received their exam results today, Ms Gilruth told the BBC she had previously instructed the current body to look at how some exams could be replaced.\n\n\"Scotland has a high number of final exams that our young people sit,\" she said.\n\n\"We have high stakes examinations in S4, S5 and S6 and across (Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, educational systems look really different.\n\n\"So, what I've asked the SQA this year to do is to look at how we might be able to move at pace at reducing a number of examinations in a certain number of qualifications - that work is already underway.\"\n\nMs Gilruth went on to stress the importance of giving young people \"the skills that they need for after they leave school\".\n\nShe added that perhaps pupils could \"thrive\" due to the use of coursework as opposed to final exams.\n\n\"I had hoped to ... confirm those changes at the end of the parliamentary term,\" she said.\n\n\"However, due to the election, I wasn't able to do so, so it will be in the early days of the coming parliamentary session.\"\n\nMSPs are due to return to Holyrood after their summer recess in the first week of September.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paige_beresford@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Paige Beresford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Gilruth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Gilruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher (Scottish)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Duncan-Glancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pam Duncan-Glancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/happy-female-high-school-students-922726227.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

with this down from 78.8% in in 2023.\n\nFor Highers, 74.9% of students passed with the top bands, down from 77.1% last year, and for Advanced Highers 75.3% of students achieved A to C grades, falling from 79.8% in 2023.\n\nThe Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) stressed \"significant caution\" should be exercised when comparing results, as changes during and after the Covid pandemic mean that different approaches have been used in awarding exams every year since 2019.\n\nHowever, the Scottish Government said the results showed the impact of the poverty-related attainment gap, stating results were \"broadly similar\" to 2019 - the last year of pre-pandemic results.\n\nEducation Secretary Jenny Gilruth said also that the recovery from the pandemic would have \"contributed to some of the variability we have seen in results this year\".\n\nShe spoke as some 145,000 students across Scotland - the highest number since 2015 - received their results on Tuesday, although problems meant some students who had signed up to be notified by email received blank results messages.\n\nScottish Conservative education spokesperson Liam Kerr hit out at the \"chaotic and shambolic situation\", saying it was \"the last thing pupils across Scotland needed on results day\".\n\nHe added: \"Receiving a blank email will have only added to pupils worries about how they did in their exams.\"\n\nSQA bosses said later they had resolved the issue - with a spokesperson stressing text results were not impacted and the \"vast majority of learners\" had received their results as expected.\n\nFiona Robertson, SQA chief executive, and Scotland's chief examining officer, said that overall \"while there is some variability in the national attainment picture in 2024, this is a solid set of results for learners in National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses\".\n\nShe added that \"2024 also marks a record-breaking year for vocational qualifications, as Scotland's learners excelled in achieving valuable skills to build rewarding careers\".\n\n\"And all of this has been achieved by a group of learners who experienced significant disruption to teaching and learning during the pandemic.\"\n\nMs Robertson insisted: \"Scotland's learners should be rightly proud of their achievements, supported by Scotland's dedicated and hard-working teachers, lecturers, our schools and colleges, and the wider education community.\"\n\nStudents were receiving grades for a wide range of qualifications including vocational awards, with a 24% increase in vocational and technical qualification awards seeing a total of 90,045 such qualifications awarded.\n\nMs Gilruth congratulated all students receiving results, noting they would have seen \"significant disruption to learning due to the pandemic at the end of primary school and the start of the secondary school journey\".\n\nThe Education Secretary added: \"I'm really heartened to see a record high 90,045 vocational or technical qualifications have been awarded this year, up almost a quarter on 2023's results.\n\n\"Young people now have a much wider range of choice than ever before, allowing them to find the route into employment or further education that is right for them, and we know that the poverty-related gap has reduced by 60% since 2009 for young people leaving school and going on to a positive destination, such as work, training or further study.\"\n\nHowever, she said: \"Of course, Scotland is not unique - and like countries the world over, our education system is still in recovery from the pandemic.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, that has contributed to some of the variability we have seen in results this year, particularly with the full return to qualifications requirements for the first time since the pandemic.\n\n\"I am determined to work with our teachers, school staff and local authorities to drive further improvements in our schools.\"\n\nA helpline staffed by careers advisers from Skills Development Scotland opened at 8am on Tuesday to help advise students and parents on options following their results.\n\nThis can be contacted on 0808 100 8000 and will be open from 8am until 8pm on both Tuesday and Wednesday, and then from 9am to 5pm on Thursday and Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, the SQA also opened its free appeals service for students who wish to challenge their grades at 9am on Tuesday.\n\nIn addition, a Scotland-wide trial will give students in some subjects access to their marked exam papers, via either their school or college. The SQA believes the move will help learners decide whether or not to appeal their result.\n\nThe qualifications body introduced this in a limited trial in 2023, with the scheme only applying then to a small group of schools across two subject areas.\n\nNow it has been expanded to all schools and colleges and can provide access to marked exam papers in five subject areas: geography (National 5 and Higher); graphic communication (National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher); media (National 5); music (National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher) and statistics (Advanced Higher).\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katrine_bussey@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Katrine Bussey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "iona_young@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Iona Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vocational education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Gilruth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Gilruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher (Scottish)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Further education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skills_Development_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skills Development Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33359809.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Scottish-Education-Secretary-Visits-Edinburgh-School-On-SQA-Results-Day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

All other appeals must be submitted by 5pm on Friday, August 30.\n\nIf an appeal is submitted, the grade can go up, down or stay the same.\n\nThe outcome of an appeal will not be sent directly to the candidate, instead it will be sent to a school, college or training provider.\n\nIf the grade is changed a new certificate will be sent out.\n\nDecisions on priority appeals will be sent to schools on Monday, September 2.\n\nFor any other appeals, the majority of decisions will be issued in October.\n\nDepending on how many appeals were submitted there could be delays.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "calum_loudon@news.stv.tv", "name": "Calum Loudon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British undergraduate degree classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STV_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "STV News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metalworking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Woodworking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web_Columns", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web Columns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0948be2fc12700badcdd94479bfbab36-social-default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-13", "textStart": 2999, "textEnd": 3008}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-21", "textStart": 3181, "textEnd": 3190}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-30", "textStart": 3246, "textEnd": 3255}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-02", "textStart": 3593, "textEnd": 3604}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The attainment gap has also increased for National 5s and Advanced Highers.\n\nScottish Labour's education spokesperson, Pam Duncan-Glancy, said the results \"speak for themselves\".\n\n\"The poverty-related attainment gap is at its highest ever level, while attainment has also fallen for all.

Their resilience is remarkable, and their achievements all the more impressive given the significant disruption to learning due to the pandemic at the end of primary school and start of the secondary school journey. Today is a chance to celebrate the full breadth of achievements attained by Scotland's young people.\n\n\"I also want to give my thanks to the teachers, lecturers and staff in our schools and colleges - and, importantly, Scotland's parents and carers - for supporting each individual young person.\n\n\"Among those achievements, I'm really heartened to see a record high 90,045 vocational or technical qualifications have been awarded this year, up almost a quarter on 2023's results.\n\n\"Young people now have a much wider range of choice than ever before, allowing them to find the route into employment or further education that is right for them and we know that the poverty related gap has reduced by 60% since 2009 for young people leaving school and going on to a positive destination, such as work, training or further study.\n\n\"Of course Scotland is not unique - and like countries the world over, our education system is still in recovery from the pandemic. Undoubtedly, that has contributed to some of the variability we have seen in results this year, particularly with the full return to qualifications requirements for the first time since the pandemic.\n\n\"I am determined to work with our teachers, school staff and local authorities to drive further improvements in our schools.\n\n\"The curriculum improvement cycle is already underway, with mathematics and numeracy being prioritised first, which is being led by the recently appointed new national specialist in Mathematics. In the coming weeks, I will publish the Behaviour Action Plan, set out new action to improve attendance and confirm the Scottish Government's next steps on qualifications reform early in the new parliamentary term.\n\n\"I am also conscious that there is a wide degree of variation in results between our 32 local authorities. To that end, I will be meeting with all local authority Directors of Education, the Chief Examiner and the interim Chief Inspector to consider the context of these results and how the Scottish Government can work with our councils to drive the improvements we all want to see.\"\n\nBackground\n\nAnyone who did not receive the results they had hoped for, or who is just unsure about their next steps, should get in touch with the SDS exam helpline for access to expert careers advice.\n\nStudents can also access the SQA's free and direct appeals service will give them the right to request a review of their marked exam papers or coursework for their National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher results this year.\n\nStatistics and information - SQA", "source": {"uri": "wired-gov.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "WiredGov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Higher (Scottish)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Gilruth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Gilruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vocational education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Further education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/channel-social/DNWA-76WKQP/$file/XMS_social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

And SNP ministers presided over another drop in pass rates and the attainment gap widened even further.\n\nCandidates who signed up to receive their results by email were sent an empty message, leaving them not knowing if they passed their exams, with the space where results should be being blank. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) confessed there was an issue and that they were working hard to fix it.\n\nThe BBC spoke to one 16-year-old, Cameron Falconer, who signed up for the service as he was away from home at gymnastics camp in Largs. He received an email at 08:10 that was blank in the section where his results should be. He said: \"It's making me feel more nervous. When I saw it at first I thought I'd got no qualifications. It's making me feel quite upset to be honest.\"\n\nIn terms of results, pass rates plummeted across the country, with the attainment gap which Nicola Sturgeon promised to get rid of, widening for the third year in a row. The Higher pass rate plummeted to its lowest level since 2007.\n\nREAD MORE: Jenny Gilruth announces plan to replace failed education body- with new organisation with same leadership team\n\nThe overall results were similar to the 2019 rate which was the final exam diet before the pandemic. Figures released by the SQA showed that the percentage of A-C grades at Higher level was 74.9%, a big drop from the 77.1% last year. It was similar to 2019 (74.8 per cent)\n\nFor Advanced Higher levels, the percentage of A-C grades was 75.3%, a big drop from 2023's 79.8%. It was also much worse than 2019 (79.4%). For National 5's, the pass rate was 77.2%, compared to 78.8% last year, and 78.2 per cent in 2019. The SQA claimed that there had been different approaches to awarding in each year since 2019 which do not allow for \"meaningful conclusions to be drawn on changes in education performance\".\n\nThis year's results are much lower than the previous three years. And in more bad news the attainment gap widened to 17.1% at Higher level, compared to 16% last year, and 14.9% the year before.\n\nIn addition, the gap in percentage points between the proportion of pupils passing has risen in National 5 from 15.6% to 17.2% and Advanced Higher increased from 11.5% to 15.5%.\n\nMs Sturgeon previously said it was the \"defining mission\" of her government to halt the gulf in performance between rich and poor pupils. But this has been failed again for another year and by a wide margin.\n\nExam pass rates Category National 5 Higher Advanced Higher Entries 327,950 196,250 28,495 A-C attainment rate 77.2% 74.9% 75.3% A attainment rate 38.0% 30.3% 30.0%\n\nEducation Secretary Jenny Gilruth said: \"Congratulations to all of Scotland's young people receiving their results for this year. Their resilience is remarkable, and their achievements all the more impressive given the significant disruption to learning due to the pandemic at the end of primary school and start of the secondary school journey. Today is a chance to celebrate the full breadth of achievements attained by Scotland's young people.\n\n\"I also want to give my thanks to the teachers, lecturers and staff in our schools and colleges - and, importantly, Scotland's parents and carers - for supporting each individual young person. Among those achievements, I'm really heartened to see a record high 90,045 vocational or technical qualifications have been awarded this year, up almost a quarter on 2023's results.\n\n'Shambolic situation is last thing pupils need'\n\nFiona Robertson, SQA Chief Executive and Scotland's Chief Examining Officer, said: \"All learners can be confident that the qualifications they have earned - by demonstrating their knowledge, understanding and skills across full course assessment - provide a solid foundation for the next stage in their learning, training, or employment. We wish them all continued success.\n\n\"While there is some variability in the national attainment picture in 2024, this is a solid set of results for learners in National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses. 2024 also marks a record-breaking year for vocational qualifications, as Scotland's learners excelled in achieving valuable skills to build rewarding careers.\n\n\"And all of this has been achieved by a group of learners who experienced significant disruption to teaching and learning during the pandemic. Scotland's learners should be rightly proud of their achievements, supported by Scotland's dedicated and hard-working teachers, lecturers, our schools and colleges, and the wider education community.\"\n\nScottish Conservative shadow cabinet secretary for education Liam Kerr MSP said: \"This chaotic and shambolic situation is the last thing pupils across Scotland needed on results day. Receiving a blank email will have only added to pupils worries about how they did in their exams.\n\n\"Successive SNP education secretaries have dithered and delayed on reforming the SQA for too long. Even then their plans amount to a sticking plaster rather than the widespread changes that Scottish education requires.\n\n\"Those in charge at the SQA must urgently be upfront as to why many students have failed to receive their results as they expected to and ensure these errors are rectified as soon as possible for all those affected.\"\n\nExtra support is available SQA's Appeals 2023 service is free of charge and opens at 9am on Results Day.

Many students are receiving their all-important grades via text or email while a healthy number are still opting for the traditional postal route.\n\nBut while many will be delighted that they have received what they needed to go on to their next adventure, there will be disappointment for those who haven't achieved what they set out to. For those people, the Scottish Qualifications Authority helpline is open from 9am to help pupils who have questions about their certificates and those who may wish to appeal their grade.\n\nLast year, the SQA announced a change to the appeals system, with alternative assessment evidence no longer being considered.\n\nREAD MORE: SNP exam results shambles as pupils sent blank certificates and pass rate falls to lowest level since 2007\n\nSo, if you're looking to appeal a grade, here's everything you need to know:\n\nAm I eligible to appeal?\n\nAny pupil concerned about their grade can launch an appeal - but typically this will only happen after being discussed with a teacher, lecturer or staff member to decide if it is in the best interest. Pupils are encouraged to consider if the grade reflects predictions or if it is unexpected.\n\nThere is a free appeals system to support all those affected, and it can be accessed by any student who feels the need. The SQA website confirms that students can apply to this service directly, and that it opens at 9am on results day.\n\nWho can't appeal?\n\nThe appeals process is open to many, but there are few circumstances where pupils will not be able to appeal. If the grade received is an A, if a course has been cancelled due to malpractice, or if a pupil has been through the Examination Exceptional Circumstances Consideration Service - which is aimed at young people who could not sit exams due to personal circumstances.\n\nThe following courses are also exempt from the appeals process: National 5 Practical Electronics; National 5 Practical Metalworking and National 5 Practical Woodworking.\n\nWhat happens in the appeal process?\n\nFollowing a change in the service announced in 2023 - an SQA appeal now doesn't involve any additional evidence being considered. The process will now simply address any possible mistake in the marking of a National 5, Higher or Advanced Higher exam paper.\n\nDuring this process, a senior marker will check that all the questions have been marked, that the marks have been added up properly, and that the correct total has been entered into the SQA system. Basically, the process is an administration check to ensure that no mistakes have been made in the original marking.\n\nSQA appeal deadline\n\nIf you are submitting an appeal, the deadline for a priority appeal is 11.59pm on Tuesday, August 13. Appeals can be withdrawn within the deadline.\n\nIf a school, college or training provider is submitting an appeal, priority appeals must be submitted by 5pm on Wednesday, August 21. All other appeals must be submitted by 5pm on Friday, August 30.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIf an appeal is submitted, the grade can go up, down or stay the same. The outcome of an appeal will not be sent directly to the candidate, instead it will be sent to a school, college or training provider.\n\nWhen will I find out if my appeal is successful?\n\nDecisions on priority appeals will be sent to schools on Monday, September 2. For any other appeals, the majority of decisions will be issued in October.\n\nFor more news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter but never miss the latest top headlines and sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "scottishdailyexpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_connor@scottishdailyexpress.co.uk", "name": "Mark Connor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalworking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metalworking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woodworking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web_Columns", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web Columns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i2-prod.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/incoming/article33403148.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_052baaa16e23b971c21969da300e45cb-1659964805.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-13", "textStart": 2836, "textEnd": 2845}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-21", "textStart": 3017, "textEnd": 3026}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-30", "textStart": 3082, "textEnd": 3091}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-02", "textStart": 3437, "textEnd": 3448}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Scotland's secondary school results are in - and it's not looking good for John Swinney's SNP government. As vast numbers of nervous students are anxiously awaiting exam outcomes that could decide whether they get a university place, it transpires that hundreds of school pupils have instead received 'blank' emails this morning. Not like the Nats to underperform, eh?\n\nJust under 150,000 pupils in Scotland are due to receive the results of their national exams today and students had the option to receive these over text, by email and by post. But many of those who signed up for email results - which were expected to come in at 8am this morning - received an, er, blank template rather than their final grades. Scotland's exam board has said it is working to 'urgently resolve an issue' and added that exam results will also be delivered by post, but frustrated parents have taken to social media to blast the soon-to-be-replaced Scottish Qualifications Authority - and the government - for the mess. One posted: 'As if the SQA needed to convince us that it wasn't fit for purpose. They managed to send out empty draft emails to a whole cohort of students waiting for results.' Another fumed: 'Thanks a lot Scot Gov, it is stressful enough without your incompetence'. Quite.\n\nBut it's not the first exam result blunder Swinney has been associated with. Mr S would advise readers to cast their minds back to 2020 when, under the former Education Secretary, pandemic results were based on predicted grades submitted by teachers to the SQA. The Scottish exam board accepted almost 75 per cent of estimates, but downgraded over 120,000 results - and it quickly transpired that students predominantly from poorer areas had fallen victim to the approach. So much for progressiveness...\n\nSwinney then had to stage a rather humiliating U-turn, while Dear Leader Nicola Sturgeon admitted the SNP 'did not get it right'. You can say that again.

It's easy and will only take a moment.\n\nAS SQA exam results start to drop through letterboxes, a Scottish Youth Parliament representative has shared a message to his peers, reminding them \"these results do not define who you are\".\n\nAround 145,000 pupils across Scotland are set to receive their high school exam results today from the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA), arriving digitally from 8am onwards or in the post.\n\nJamie Dickson, Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament and Alness Academy pupil, shared some thoughts with his peers.\n\nHe said: \"Results day can be really stressful for lots of people, especially if you don't get the results you wanted. It is extremely important to remember that these results do not define who you are -- although they can help you in life, there are always ways to work around it.\n\n\"It's important that if you are frustrated, anxious or angry after your results come through the post, that you talk to someone about how you are feeling.\n\n\"It is very important to look after your mental health and wellbeing during this time, as it is really stressful. Talk to someone you trust, and don't let feelings build up inside you.\n\n\"Never feel pressured to share your results with anyone if they ask you too.\"\n\nNSPCC have also provided their advice for managing results day.\n\nAdvice from NSPCC for young people who may not achieved the results they wanted, is:\n\n* Ask a teacher, careers advisor or any adult you trust what they think and discuss your options and how you are feeling.\n\n* Remind yourself of what you did well in whether that be specific pieces of coursework, or other parts of your life.\n\n* Don't compare yourself to your friends.\n\n* If you do not feel your grade reflects your ability speak to your school about making an appeal.\n\n* Look at other courses or training programmes and apprenticeships that you can do.\n\n* If you haven't got a place at your chosen university, try not to worry as there is a chance you could get a place at another university through the clearing process.\n\n* Take a gap year and do something different like volunteering.\n\n* Look at different courses that you can do with the grades you have achieved.\n\nAdvice from NSPCC for parents and carers is:\n\n* Your child may find it hard to talk to you about their results so be patient and supportive until they feel ready to talk about how they feel.\n\n* Encourage your child to take their time to think about what they want to do next. There's no need to rush into a decision straightaway.\n\n* Help them think about their choices by writing down a list of pros and cons for each of their options\n\n* If they are finding it hard to talk to you, let them know they can contact Childline for free, confidential support and advice on 0800 1111 or www.childline.org.uk\n\nThe SQA's candidate advice line will also be open from 8am to 6pm on August 6, as well as guidance staff at schools being on hand for help.", "source": {"uri": "ross-shirejournal.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "RossShire Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Youth_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Youth Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Children", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alness", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alness"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alness"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Childline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gap year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.ross-shirejournal.co.uk/_media/img/UPW7XU0O8F7LS07PPJD7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2915, "textEnd": 2923}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Their resilience is remarkable, and their achievements all the more impressive given the significant disruption to learning due to the pandemic at the end of primary school and start of the secondary school journey. Today is a chance to celebrate the full breadth of achievements attained by Scotland's young people.\n\n\"I also want to give my thanks to the teachers, lecturers and staff in our schools and colleges - and, importantly, Scotland's parents and carers - for supporting each individual young person.\n\n\"Among those achievements, I'm really heartened to see a record high 90,045 vocational or technical qualifications have been awarded this year, up almost a quarter on 2023's results.\n\n\"Young people now have a much wider range of choice than ever before, allowing them to find the route into employment or further education that is right for them and we know that the poverty related gap has reduced by 60% since 2009 for young people leaving school and going on to a positive destination, such as work, training or further study.\n\n\"Of course Scotland is not unique - and like countries the world over, our education system is still in recovery from the pandemic. Undoubtedly, that has contributed to some of the variability we have seen in results this year, particularly with the full return to qualifications requirements for the first time since the pandemic.\n\n\"I am determined to work with our teachers, school staff and local authorities to drive further improvements in our schools.\n\n\"The curriculum improvement cycle is already underway, with mathematics and numeracy being prioritised first, which is being led by the recently appointed new national specialist in Mathematics. In the coming weeks, I will publish the Behaviour Action Plan, set out new action to improve attendance and confirm the Scottish Government's next steps on qualifications reform early in the new parliamentary term.\n\n\"I am also conscious that there is a wide degree of variation in results between our 32 local authorities. To that end, I will be meeting with all local authority Directors of Education, the Chief Examiner and the interim Chief Inspector to consider the context of these results and how the Scottish Government can work with our councils to drive the improvements we all want to see.\"\n\nAnyone who did not receive the results they had hoped for, or who is just unsure about their next steps, should get in touch with the SDS exam helpline for access to expert careers advice.\n\nStudents can also access the SQA's free and direct appeals service will give them the right to request a review of their marked exam papers or coursework for their National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher results this year.", "source": {"uri": "caithness-business.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "caithness-business.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Higher (Scottish)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Gilruth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Gilruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vocational education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Further education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://caithness-business.co.uk/images/orgmap.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

However, our initial assessment suggests attainment in Highland largely mirrors the national picture. It is important to acknowledge, as the Cabinet Secretary for Education said herself this morning, this is the first year since 2019 that the full range of external assessment has been undertaken, with no adjustments made for Covid. At the same time, there is no doubt that the cohort of young people taking exams this year have experienced significant disruption in their education over the last 4 years. They are to be congratulated on their hard work and resilience.\"\n\nAssistant Chief Executive - People, Kate Lackie said: \"I would like to congratulate all our young people today as they receive accreditation for their achievements, for both graded and ungraded course awards. Today's results reflect the hard work of the students over many months and years of study and the support and guidance of their families, teachers and wider school staff.\n\n\"Where a young person may not have received the grades or qualifications they set out to achieve, it is only natural that they will be disappointed. I would encourage anyone in this position to access the support and guidance that's available to help them. It is also important to recognise that exams are not the sole route to success.

An already stressful time for anxious pupils has been made worse after hundreds of students across the country received blank email templates instead of their grades - a gaffe which the Scottish Qualifications Authority is scrambling to fix - while a flailing Scottish government struggles to explain why the poverty-related attainment looks worse, and wider, than ever.\n\nThe bad news for Scottish students doesn't end there. 2024's national exam results don't just demonstrate that the gap has widened; today's figures have almost all eclipsed pre-pandemic levels. The overall pass rate for National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exam results has plunged again - as it has every year since the pandemic highs in 2020.\n\nPupils from all backgrounds - whether rich or poor - have achieved worse outcomes than their peers in previous years. It spells trouble for an SNP that only a month ago faced off a frustrated electorate in the national poll and came away rather badly. John Swinney, the current First Minister, has continually talked about tackling child poverty, and yet his country's schools are failing Scotland's poorest children.\n\nFor Scotland's most deprived students, things look particularly bad. Since last year, the 20 per cent poorest students have seen their pass rate drop by almost 3 per cent to 68.4 per cent - the lowest since equivalent figures were collected in 2016. For those sitting Highers, the most important exams required for university admission, the pass rate has fallen by just under 3 per cent since last year, with this year's pass rate only marginally better than the low of 2019. As for Advanced Highers, which are increasingly crucial in the securing of an offer from university, there was a staggering decrease in pass rate of 7.5 per cent since 2023, and over 5 per cent since the last low in 2019.\n\nWhat does this mean in terms of attainment gap? The difference in pass rates between the top most affluent students and the most deprived is, for every single level of exam, wider than ever. It's a damning indictment of an SNP government that has consistently overpromised and underdelivered. Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister, told the nation when she got the top job that she wanted to be judged on her ability to close the poverty-related attainment gap. Despite the gap narrowing in 2020 - after another SNP government slip-up that led to the reversal of downgraded results - Sturgeon wasn't able to make sufficient progress on this before she left office. Her successor Swinney has his work cut out if he is to turn things around before the Holyrood election in 2026.\n\nThe Scottish government has proposed that a new exam body replace the current Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) in 2025, to be called Qualifications Scotland. It's one of a number of changes put forward in a new Education (Scotland) Bill that was published last month, including a reform of Education Scotland to focus more on curriculum changes. But many have argued the government is moving too slowly on an issue that needs serious attention. The SNP administration has already spent almost \u00a31 million on commissioning education and exam system reviews, and yet there has been no material improvement in pupil performance. Today's results show that it is action - not more paperwork - that is desperately required.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_dunn@spectator.us", "name": "Lucy Dunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Salmond_government", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Salmond government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher (Scottish)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Sturgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Education Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1227905443.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Undoubtedly, that has contributed to some of the variability we have seen in results this year, particularly with the full return to qualifications requirements for the first time since the pandemic.\n\n\"I am determined to work with our teachers, school staff and local authorities to drive further improvements in our schools.\n\n\"The curriculum improvement cycle is already underway, with mathematics and numeracy being prioritised first, which is being led by the recently appointed new national specialist in Mathematics.\n\n\"In the coming weeks, I will publish the Behaviour Action Plan, set out new action to improve attendance and confirm the Scottish Government's next steps on qualifications reform early in the new parliamentary term.\n\n\"I am also conscious that there is a wide degree of variation in results between our 32 local authorities. To that end, I will be meeting with all local authority directors of education, the chief examiner and the interim chief inspector to consider the context of these results and how the Scottish Government can work with our councils to drive the improvements we all want to see.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_(Scottish)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Higher (Scottish)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Qualifications_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Qualifications Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_for_Excellence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum for Excellence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Higher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Higher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Gilruth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Gilruth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vocational education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Further education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.thenational.scot/resources/images/17499006/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793502", "eventUri": "eng-9793502", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

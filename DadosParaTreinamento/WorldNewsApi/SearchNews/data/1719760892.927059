The total number of blocked spam and scam SMS messages fell substantially from 1.1 billion in Q1 2023 to 362.8 million in Q1 2024. Over the same time span, the number of scam SMS messages directly reported by customers declined 44% year-on-year \u2013 from 610 in Q1 2023 to 342 in Q1 2024. Mavenir\u2019s SpamShield technology has delivered an immediate and measurable impact for Globe \u2013 which reported blocking over 5 billion spam and scam messages in 2023 \u2013 by significantly raising the technical barriers to send fraudulent campaigns, increasing the cost of fraud, and removing profit incentives for scammers. Mavenir\u2019s SpamShield operates as a powerful SMS firewall \u2013 incorporating advanced monitoring, adaptive analytics, and real-time machine learning (ML) capabilities \u2013 that empowers Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to automatically block millions of fraudulent messages before they ever reach subscribers. SpamShield\u2019s AI/ML detection algorithms adapt to current network conditions and subscriber behavior to continually detect spammer and fraudster attempts \u2013 enabling CSPs to quickly identify and act on potential threats and harmful events. This unique and innovative solution delivers an improved experience and greater security for customers, while protecting CSPs\u2019 revenues from the negative costs of malicious activity. Commenting on its successful spam reduction initiative, Anton Bonifacio, Chief Information Security Officer for Globe said: \u201cMavenir\u2019s SpamShield technology has proven its ability to offer timely, precise, and effective threat detection and response, playing a central role in this dramatic reduction of spam and scam SMS traffic across our network to the immense benefit of all our customers. We now consider SpamShield an essential component of Globe\u2019s anti-spam strategy moving forward, as we increase our innovation investment and strengthen our defenses against the tide of increasingly sophisticated fraudulent activity.\u201d Ilia Abramov, VP & GM of the Security Business Unit at Mavenir added: \u201cGlobe\u2019s implementation of our SpamShield technology underlines its stringent and highly proactive approach to safeguarding customers, protecting users through the most robust and intelligent anti-spam messaging solution available today. The massive drop in blocked messages evidenced by these remarkable numbers shows how SpamShield achieves its transformative results in operation \u2013 making fraudulent activity prohibitively difficult and unprofitable for scammers, who then move on to easier and less protected targets including other operators and OTT channels such as WhatsApp. Globe is at the forefront of industry efforts to protect subscribers from this growing and ever-evolving array of threats, and we will continue to vigorously support its efforts to optimize communication safety and messaging authenticity in the Philippines.\u201d", "summary": "Figures show scale of fraudster deterrence, with blocked messages falling by 67% \u2013 from 1B in Q1 23 to 362K in Q1 24 RICHARDSON, Texas &#8212; Mavenir, the cloud-native network infrastructure provider building the future of networks, today announces that its world-leading SpamShield messaging fraud prevention technology is driving a steep decline in the volume [&#8230;]", "url": "https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/mavenirs-spamshield-messaging-technology-drives-steep-decline-in-spam-and-scam-sms-for-globe-telecom", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/commuters-on-bay-street-as-canadian-stocks-mixed.jpg?quality=5&strip=all&w=100&sig=gCsOruxPhrA8bPqdSVYb6g", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:21:47", "author": "Business Wire", "authors": ["Business Wire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.059}

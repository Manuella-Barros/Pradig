The driver, he said, could be held criminally responsible for the deaths.\n\n\"Assuming that we know who the driver is, and assuming that the driver survived, then the driver can be held accountable for any of the unfortunate fatalities that occurred,\" Lustgarten said. \"As far as what specific charges, that remains to be seen.

We have very little physical evidence. So, for us to determine exactly who was driving is going to be a chore. It's not impossible.\"The sheriff says it might also be difficult to charge the teens in connection with the stolen car since prosecutors will have to prove the teens knew the car they were in was stolen.For now, the teens have been released pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nMartin County Sheriff William Snyder said it's not clear if anyone will be held criminally responsible for a fatal high-speed crash Tuesday morning.\n\nRescuers pulled two more bodies from the river near Kanner Highway Wednesday, confirming that three people were killed when a car crashed into the water.\n\nThe sheriff's office identified one victim as 17-year-old Marcus Griffin of Lake Worth.\n\nThe identities of the other two have not yet been released.\n\nInvestigators said five people had been in the stolen car as it sped through the county at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour, running red lights and driving into oncoming traffic.\n\nThe car eventually lost control as it reached the end of Cove Road, crossed Kanner Highway, went through trees and into water, sinking.\n\nTwo teenagers survived.\n\n\"A tragic loss of life, very sad,\" Snyder said. \"But this was completely avoidable. Had that car stopped, had they not gotten into a stolen car, had they not went racing through the streets at triple digit speeds, we would not have three people dead right now.\"\n\nSnyder said it's unknown right now if the two survivors will be charged.\n\nHe said in order to charge them in connection with the three deaths, investigators have to know who was driving the car.\n\nAnd he said the two teens aren't talking.\n\n\"This is a difficult case, because we have two uncooperating suspects,\" Snyder said. \"We have three dead victims. We have very little physical evidence. So, for us to determine exactly who was driving is going to be a chore. It's not impossible.\"\n\nThe sheriff says it might also be difficult to charge the teens in connection with the stolen car since prosecutors will have to prove the teens knew the car they were in was stolen.\n\nFor now, the teens have been released pending the outcome of the investigation.", "source": {"uri": "wpbf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPBF"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ari_hait@wpbf.com", "name": "Ari Hait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Otterbein_Snyder", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Otterbein Snyder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Martin County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Snyder_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Snyder (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/fatal-crash-663c14f13ba40.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.357xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551413", "eventUri": "eng-9551413", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Rattler's draft fall was mostly attributed to character concerns and a loaded QB class, not talent. However, some scouts consider Rattler on par with first-round prospect Bo Nix, claiming the Saints got the steal of the draft.\n\nWith the 150th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, the New Orleans Saints drafted quarterback Spencer Rattler from the University of South Carolina.\n\nThe pick ended a four-round-long drought in between quarterback selections. After six quarterbacks were drafted in the top-12 - Caleb Williams (No. 1 overall), Jayden Daniels (No. 2), Drake Maye (No. 3), Michael Penix Jr. (No. 8), J.J. McCarthy (No. 10), and Bo Nix (No. 12) - the Saints waited 138 selections to make Rattler the next signal caller off the board.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The 2024 NFL Draft set a couple of QB-related records: the most quarterbacks selected in the first twelve picks of the draft (six), as well as the most picks between quarterback selections (138).\n\nHis draft slide was the culmination of a myriad of factors, as Rattler was once seen as a potential number-one overall pick following a stellar sophomore season at Oklahoma, when he threw for 3,031 yards and 28 touchdowns and led the Sooners to a 9-2 record in the shortened COVID year.\n\nHe eventually transferred to South Carolina after losing his starting gig and performed adequately, though it was reported last week that many NFL GMs chalked up Rattler's draft board fall to an appearance on a reality show back in high school.\n\nHowever, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler is now reporting that many scouts had Rattler in the same tier of prospect as Nix. One source in particular told Fowler that Rattler \"[was] not perceived as 138 picks worse than Bo Nix\", and that the Saints got a late-round steal.\n\nThough it remains to be seen if the former Sooner and Gamecock can usurp Derek Carr for the starting gig in the Big Easy, the Saints seemingly made an excellent call in halting Rattler's slide.\n\nRelated How a Reality Show from High School Damaged Spencer Rattler's Draft Stock The New Orleans Saints selected quarterback Spencer Rattler with the 150th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft despite character concerns. Rattler's Fall Due To Need, Not Talent QB-needy teams scratched their itch early on during the draft\n\nRattler started his college career at the University of Oklahoma, where he was seen for a time as the next face of college football. After struggling following his breakout season, Rattler was eventually replaced by the number one pick in this year's draft class, Caleb Williams.\n\nAfter losing his gig at Oklahoma, Rattler transferred to South Carolina for a fresh start and a chance to get his college career back on track. Rattler threw for over 3,000 yards during the 2023 season and had 19 touchdown passes. His 147.7 QBR showed a much more poised player capable of making good decisions when throwing the ball down the field.\n\nThough his athletic testing left much to be desired, Rattler's maturity and leadership improved tremendously as the years wore on. According to the scout, Rattler's performance in the QB1 documentary didn't alter perceptions around him too much, at least for teams that took him seriously to begin with.\n\n\"Really didn't harp on it much -- it wasn't a big thing. He's matured a lot since then, like we all have. If there was a camera in my face when I was in high school, I wouldn't have looked great, either. He was impressive in his interviews.\"\n\nAs such, it seems likely that Rattler's fall was simply just a product of being last among a loaded quarterback class. All five teams who were desperate for a quarterback this year took their preferred prospect early on, and because the Atlanta Falconsshocked the world by taking Michael Penix in the top-ten, the Las Vegas Raiders decided to stick with their incumbent tandem of Gardner Minshew and Aidan O'Connell.\n\nThe Saints currently have Carr as their starting quarterback, with Jake Haener, Nathan Peterman, and Kellen Mond listed as backups. Rattler should have every opportunity to become QB2 on the depth chart during his rookie season, and there remains a remote possibility that he becomes the next Day Three quarterback to take over as the franchise signal caller.\n\nSource: Jeremy Fowler\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless otherwise stated.\n\nRelated 2024 NFL Draft Prospects: Spencer Rattler's scouting

The seventh, Spencer Rattler, waited five rounds and two days to be drafted at 150th overall - a record gap between passers in the draft - by the New Orleans Saints.\n\nWhat NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported about a dozen picks earlier, as the Los Angeles Chargers were on the clock at No. 137, is why figures from Rattler's past feel that the pre-draft process was another opportunity for his detractors to misconstrue his character.\n\n\"This is kind of weird to say, honestly. Spencer Rattler did a reality show in high school. It's called, 'QB1: Beyond the Lights,'\" Rapoport said on the NFL Network draft broadcast. \"It did not make him look great, and it is unbelievable how many different teams mentioned to me the image of him in that show, and how they can't get it out of their heads. Which I think would be a public service announcement to all 17-year-olds, but it is fascinating as teams weigh whether or not to draft him.\"\n\nRattler began his college career at Oklahoma only to lose his starting job to Caleb Williams (the No. 1 pick in the draft) amid a tumultuous sophomore campaign, later calling the events surrounding his departure a \"toxic\" situation. In high school, though, Rattler appeared on the third season of the documentary series directed and produced by \"Friday Night Lights\" TV show creator Peter Berg. The episodes aired in 2019 and chronicled Rattler's senior season the previous year at Pinnacle High School in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nOne clip from the show, which has nearly 775,000 views on YouTube, shows Rattler laying into receivers during practice and also getting into an argument with junior quarterback J.D. Johnson.\n\n\"What did you do in one-on-ones?\" Johnson asked Rattler.\n\n\"I blamed it on you,\" Rattler replied. \"Because you sucked.\"\n\nAlthough Rattler told Johnson later in the clip he \"made him better,\" he also called Johnson \"soft\" and \"a girl.\"\n\n\"You never lift me up,\" Johnson said at one point in the nearly two-minute video.\n\nReality television also has a way of distorting perspectives.\n\n\"It does make him look pretty bad, but in the same breath, there's not a lot of context to it,\" Johnson told USA TODAY Sports. \"The reason why they put that clip together the way they did was to make him look bad and to create exactly what they created.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' request for comment to Berg's production company, Film 45, was not returned.\n\n'Clickbait' to some, not the full story to others\n\nThe image of Rattler in \"QB1\" as a combative teammate with nefarious leadership tendencies followed him around to his early enrollment with the Sooners and his transfer to South Carolina. And it was something NFL teams mentioned during their interactions with Rattler's high school coach, Dana Zupke, and his trainer, Rube Oliver.\n\n\"I think that's clickbait,\" Zupke said of \"QB1\" being a reason why Rattler waited a while to hear his name called in the draft. \"I don't think that that had much bearing at all on where he ended up in the draft.\"\n\nBased on the feedback he received in his discussions with teams, Zupke - who provided teams with written evaluations and also spoke directly with a handful - said he's \"really confident that was not an issue.\"\n\n\"It came up, but I don't think there was a lot of concern about how he was portrayed on 'QB1,' to be honest,\" Zupke told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe microscope of \"QB1\" exacerbated Rattler's suspension due to an eligibility rule violation toward the end of his final high school season. That Rattler and his parents first tried to mask the suspension as an injury didn't help and put Zupke in a difficult situation since he knew his quarterback was healthy.\n\nBut the Rapoport report was the first time Oliver had heard \"QB1\" rubbed people wrong at the NFL level. Rattler's people-handling skills and leadership abilities have only improved since then, Oliver said.\n\n\"He was a kid, man. A lot of kids act like that,\" Oliver told USA TODAY Sports. \"But he was the No. 1 QB in the country. So it's highlighted. Doesn't make it right.\"\n\nWhile the interaction might appear cruel to a viewer outside the Pinnacle locker room, what the clip does not account for is the relationship behind the words. Rattler and Johnson were friends. And like most people, Zupke said, Rattler isn't the same person he was in high school.\n\n\"He was one of my good friends and I can confidently say he's one of the most competitive guys I've ever met,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe animosity in the clip, Oliver said, is \"like brothers bickering, 'Hey, man, I'm better than you.'\"\n\nThey hung out away from school and football. Rattler would drive Johnson to their private quarterback workouts. And everything was a competition.\n\n\"The clip didn't show me giving anything back to him, but there was days I was ... screaming at him, 'You suck, Spencer!' That's what we did,\" said Johnson, who committed to Michigan but had to medically retire and became a student-coach. \"Honestly, that's what made both of us so good, in my opinion.\"\n\nNo NFL teams contacted Johnson during their vetting processes.\n\n'Come out the other side a really good dude'\n\nRattler was the consensus seventh quarterback in the class and placed in a tier below those who went off the board before him.\n\nThere are many football-related reasons to explain Rattler's fall to the fifth round. Teams that needed quarterbacks got them early. Entering the draft, most teams didn't need a starter, or even youthful depth at the position. On \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" ESPN insider Adam Schefter said the two teams most interested in Rattler heading into the draft were the Atlanta Falcons, who took Michael Penix at No. 8 overall, and the Denver Broncos, who got their guy in Bo Nix at No. 12.\n\n\"Those are all good players, good quarterbacks,\" Rattler said in a news conference regarding the crop of quarterbacks picked at the top of the draft. \"Whatever team felt like they needed to make that pick, they did. You got to control what you can. That's something I live by. I knew my time would come.\"\n\nMultiple teams leaking their concerns regarding Rattler to Rapoport because of the documentary troubled Johnson.\n\n\"I think that's pretty (expletive) to do to a kid in high school and ultimately have a long-time effect on what people think of him,\" Johnson said.\n\nRattler's college career began auspiciously. As a redshirt freshman in 2020, he completed 67.5% of his passes in Lincoln Riley's offense for 3,031 yards with 28 touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\nWilliams arrived in 2021, though, and Rattler - who measures at 6-foot, 211 pounds - was benched during the \"Red River Rivalry\" game against Texas. He never regained his starting role and transferred to South Carolina in 2022.\n\nGamecocks head coach Shane Beamer raved to NFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah about Rattler's growth while playing with the Gamecocks; the quarterback was a two-time captain and started all 12 games in 2023, throwing for 3,186 yards, 18 touchdowns and eight interceptions with a 70.1% completion percentage.\n\n\"For the immaturity that he got tagged with from the show when he was in high school, and maybe some of the early stuff at Oklahoma, he's made it through all that stuff,\" Jeremiah said last month on the \"Mina Kimes Show.\" \"He's come out the other side a really good dude on top of somebody who's gotten better throughout his college career.\"\n\nAnd for all of the baggage Rattler has had to check because of \"QB1,\" the idea itself wasn't misguided. Quarterbacks such as Justin Fields, Jake Fromm and Sam Hartman also appeared on the show. Zupke and Rattler's parents had to be the ones who agreed to allow camera-crew access, and Zupke said he still sees more upside than downside because of the national recognition for the program that came with the show.\n\n\"I don't know if anyone would ever want a camera crew following them around like that for the rest of their life, but for six to eight months, it's a good experience,\" Johnson said, adding it was good publicity for the vast majority of the team.\n\nBut not for Rattler.\n\n\"The ones closest to him understand him and know who he is at heart,\" Oliver said. \"And he's always known who he is at heart. He's just now reflecting it.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Rattler",

While six signal-callers were chosen in the first round, the next was Rattler in the fifth round, a steep fall-off as character concerns crashed his stock, something that Saints star Tyrann Mathieu relates to in some ways.\n\nMathieu was on the show \"RG3 and The Ones\" hosted by former player Robert Griffin III and spoke about how he knew about Rattler since he was with the Arizona Cardinals and how the quarterback played high school football in the same state. He would even call him the \"Aaron Rodgers of high football\" and even said that \"I went through some of the same challenges.\"\n\n\"You know I spent the early part of my career in Arizona. He was like the Aaron Rodgers of high school football. The kid can always spin the rock. We all go through challenging stuff, I went through some of the same challenges you know as a youngster,\" Mathieu said. \"You know a lot of people that I've talked to they've said he's turned the corner.\n\n\"You know I think as a youngster man, that's all you can ask of them is to grow and learn from things you need to learn from and then just start to put your best foot forward,\" Mathieu continued. \"He's going to get a lot of work with us, we got 2,3 DB Units that can go out there, so he's gonna get plenty of work. And then he's in a good role too like you said man, DC is a good dude and takes a lot of punches too. He'll learn from him, he'll learn a lot from him, especially first year.\"\n\nRattler's character concerns spawned in high school\n\nAs Mathieu alluded to, he had some troubles in his collegiate career as he was at one time, thrown off the LSU football team for violating substance abuse policies. He would fall to the third round, turned a corner, and became a top defensive player in the NFL.\n\nWhen it comes to Rattler, the troubles happened during when he was on a high school football reality show called \"QB1: Beyond the Lights\" where he was not painted in the best light. According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, he said that teams expressed that the way he was portrayed on the show wasn't the best and \"how they can't get it out of their heads.\"\n\n\"This is kind of weird to say, honestly. Spencer Rattler did a reality show in high school. It's called, 'QB1: Beyond the Lights,'\" Rapoport said via USA Today. \"It did not make him look great, and it is unbelievable how many different teams mentioned to me the image of him in that show, and how they can't get it out of their heads. Which I think would be a public service announcement to all 17-year-olds, but it is fascinating as teams weigh whether or not to draft him.\"\n\nOn the other hand, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler spoke to an anonymous team source and mentioned how the Rattler in high school isn't the same person in the present. They even mentioned how \"he's matured a lot since then.\"\n\n\"Really didn't harp on it much -- it wasn't a big thing,\" the anonymous source said to Fowler. \"He's matured a lot since then, like we all have. If there was a camera in my face when I was in high school, I wouldn't have looked great, either. He was impressive in his interviews.\"\n\nThe draft stock of Rattler is not bad besides the character concerns\n\nThere are some saying that the Saints selecting Rattler is the \"steal of the draft\" since he came into it with a lot of talent, but the character concerns were in some ways holding him back. Apparently, the Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos were also high on Rattler according to Fowler.\n\n\"South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler's fall to the fifth round was, in part, a need issue. Two teams extremely high on him -- the Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos -- drafted quarterbacks in the top 12,\" Fowler wrote. \"That essentially left the Las Vegas Raiders, who had made the calculation that an Aidan O'Connell-Gardner Minshew combo alleviated the need to reach for a quarterback. But make no mistake, Rattler is not perceived as 138 picks worse than Bo Nix -- some evaluators had him awfully close to the same tier as Nix. One team source had zero issues with the perceived image concerns facing Rattler, whose appearance in the documentary \"QB1\" during his high school career did not portray his personality in the best light.\"\n\nRattler has had an interesting career himself as coming out of high school as a top recruit, he started with the University of Oklahoma. He actually ended up losing the starting job to Caleb Williams who ended up transferring to USC and became the No. 1 pick this draft.\n\nThe 23-year old quarterback would then transfer to the University of South Carolina where he spent two seasons and in his last one, threw for 3,186 yards, 19 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. He looks to learn under current Saints starting quarterback Derek Carr and be their hopeful future.\n\nMathieu talks about the mindset of Saints\n\nAs for Mathieu, he is entering in his 12th season this fall and his third with the Saints after spending other years with the Cardinals, Houston Texans, and the Kansas City Chiefs. He said on the Ross Tucker Football Podcast that the only motto the team should have is to \"work hard.\"\n\n\"Our motto this year is to keep our head down and work,\" Mathieu said via Yard Barker. \"Don't even cater or give in to expectations, if there are any. ... We don't even need anybody to talk about us. We just need to work hard.\"\n\nNew Orleans is trying to improve after a 9-8 finish which put them second in the NFC South after a disappointing overall season with a lot of expectations around them. They look to live up to those same expectations this season as Rattler will likely learn on the sidelines.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"},

With the 150th pick, the New Orleans Saints took South Carolina quarterback Spencer Rattler. New Orleans now has five quarterbacks on the roster.\n\nSpencer Rattler had to rebuild his career. He played at Oklahoma for three years (2019-2021) before he was benched for Caleb Williams. At Oklahoma, he played in 19 games with 4,595 passing yards 40 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He was also named first-team Big-12 in 2020.\n\nRattler would transfer to South Carolina before the start of the 2022 season. He would start in 25 games and gather 6,212 passing yards with 48 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. It seems that Rattler was more comfortable in South Carolina than he was in Oklahoma. His last two seasons were the best of his career.\n\nThe Saints now have five quarterbacks on the roster:\n\nWhat makes Rattler stand out to scouts is his arm talent and pocket presence. Rattler can move within the pocket and make the necessary throws. Spencer Rattler also mentioned that he has a strong connection with Saints legend Archie Manning.

He will be expected to slot in as a first-year starter as Russell Wilson's replacement in Denver.\n\nThe Broncos made NFL history by drafting Nix at the top of the first round.\n\nThe 2024 draft marked the first time in league history that six quarterbacks had been selected within the top 12 picks, as the Chicago Bears, New England Patriots, Washington Commanders, Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings selected new signal-callers by the time the Broncos came up on the board.\n\nRattler then had to wait four more rounds to hear his name called as the next quarterback drafted behind Nix.\n\nThe Saints drafted Rattler after he passed for more than 3,000 yards for the second straight season as a starter for South Carolina in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_stumbaugh@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Julia Stumbaugh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Nix", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bo Nix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Rattler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Rattler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Carr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Carr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715092728/bzzmlpp9sldatp7n9ncq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550965", "eventUri": "eng-9550965", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The hype around the former South Carolina Gamecock is palpable. Even beyond the bounds of the Gulf Coast, the impact of the selection can be felt.\n\nFormer NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III called Rattler the \"QB steal of the draft\" after the Saints selected him in the fifth round of the 2024 selection process. Griffin cited Rattler's ability to manage the game pre-snap, make plays under pressure and arm talent in the process.\n\nRattler had an embattled journey into and through college. From his often-criticized Netflix docuseries appearance in \"QB1: Beyond the Lights\" to a tumultuous couple of years at Oklahoma, the 23-year-old quarterback is looking to buck expectations after two years at South Carolina.\n\nMuch like the fans, even Saints players themselves feel they see a lot in Rattler. Griffin continued his conversations around the young signal caller in his recent t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Saints safety Tyrann Mathieu, who spent his early career days with the Arizona Cardinals while Rattler played high school football in the same state. Turns out, Rattler's reputation as a star quarterback proceeded him.\n\n\"He was like the Aaron Rodgers of high school football,\" Mathieu said. \"The kid could always spin the rock. Like I said, we all go through challenging stuff. I went through some of the same challenges as a youngster.\"\n\nFor all the off-field attention that Rodgers has garnered in the latter-days of his playing career, his on-field performance was always considered among the best in the league. Especially during Mathieu's days with the Cardinals. High praise for the rookie.\n\nMathieu went on to explain that Rattler is landing in a good spot for a young passer as well, highlighting the opportunity to learn from the team's starting quarterback Derek Carr. \"He's going to get a lot of work with us,\" Mathieu said. \"He's in a good room, too. (Derek Carr) is a good dude. He takes a lot of punches too. I think he'll learn from him. He'll learn a lot from him. Especially in his first year.\"\n\nCarr addressed the idea of having another young passer in the building this week in his conversation with Zach Ewing of NOLA.com.\n\n\"I am 33 years old, Taysom is 33 years old. You have to eventually find someone to groom for the next several years to be that guy.\"\n\nThe best opportunity Rattler is going to get at the next level is going to start with landing in a supportive environment. With the vote of confidence from a veteran leader like Mathieu and the understanding nature of his selection from Carr, it sure sounds like he will be settling into exactly that here in New Orleans.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Rattler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Rattler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griffin_III", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Griffin III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Gamecocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Gamecocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Gamecocks football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QB1:_Beyond_the_Lights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QB1: Beyond the Lights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Carr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Carr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrann_Mathieu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrann Mathieu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3378,h_1900,x_0,y_109/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/saints_news_network/01hxfprb8x5w58k1j7k4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550965", "eventUri": "eng-9550965", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

I felt like I was the best, felt like I could have helped us win all the games,\" Williams said.\n\nRattler was projected to be a No. 1 overall pick when he eventually came out of college, giving the Sooners a strong quarterback room. Williams believed that he had earned the right to start but that the program gave preferential treatment to Rattler.\n\n\"I told people before I went there that I was going to start and play, beat him out,\" Williams noted. \"Thought I beat him out in spring and he was project No. 1 and all that so he started for six games so I prepared, kept preparing.\"\n\nA few games into the season, Rattler was eventually benched for Williams and the now No. 1 overall pick showed what he could do. He helped the Sooners make an incredible comeback against the University of Texas and from then on, he was the starter.\n\nWilliams has always believed in his abilities and it has helped him get to where he is today.

Of the 40 invitees all but two play offense, outside of Indianapolis Colts defensive end Laiatu Latu and Minnesota Vikings linebacker Dallas Turner. And nearly half the group plays wide receiver. You won't find a single offensive lineman in the group, either. There's a pretty clear emphasis on wideouts and quarterbacks, plus running backs.\n\nMaybe that's a side effect of fantasy football limiting fans' exposure to the most popular positions in standard-format leagues.

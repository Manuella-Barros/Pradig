As AI systems become more advanced and ubiquitous, the need for companies to develop comprehensive AI policies has become critical. These policies serve as a framework for responsible AI deployment, ensuring that the technology is used ethically, legally, and effectively. The importance of having an AI policy is underscored by the actions of several leading organizations that have already established such guidelines.\n\nFirstly, AI policies are essential for managing ethical considerations. AI systems can make decisions that have profound implications on people's lives, such as in hiring processes, loan approvals, and law enforcement. Without proper guidelines, these systems can perpetuate or even exacerbate biases and discrimination. An AI policy helps companies identify potential ethical issues and implement measures to mitigate them. For instance, Google has developed its AI Principles, which outline objectives such as avoiding unfair bias, being accountable to people, and ensuring privacy and security. These principles guide Google's AI development and use, aiming to prevent harm and promote fairness.\n\nSecondly, AI policies are crucial for legal compliance. The regulatory landscape for AI is evolving, with governments around the world introducing new laws and regulations to govern its use. Companies need to navigate this complex environment to avoid legal pitfalls. An AI policy provides a structured approach to compliance, helping organizations adhere to relevant regulations. For instance, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes explicit rules governing automated decision-making and profiling. Companies operating in the EU must ensure their AI systems comply with these rules, and having a robust AI policy can facilitate this process.\n\nMoreover, AI policies help safeguard user privacy and data security. AI systems often rely on large datasets to function effectively, which raises concerns about how this data is collected, stored, and used. A well-defined AI policy addresses these issues by establishing standards for data governance, including data anonymization, consent, and access controls. Microsoft's AI principles emphasize the importance of privacy and security, committing to stringent data protection measures and transparent data practices. This safeguards users and at the same time fosters trust among customers and stakeholders.\n\nAI policies also play a vital role in fostering transparency and accountability. As AI systems and platforms become more complex, understanding their decision-making processes becomes increasingly challenging. This opacity can lead to mistrust and skepticism among users and the public. An AI policy that promotes transparency can help demystify these systems. For instance, IBM has published its AI Ethics and Principles, which include commitments to transparency and explainability. IBM aims to ensure that AI decisions are understandable and that there is clarity about how data is used, and AI models are trained.\n\nFurthermore, AI policies encourage innovation and sustainable growth. By providing clear guidelines, these policies can help companies navigate the ethical and legal challenges associated with AI, allowing them to focus on innovation and development. A structured approach to AI can lead to the creation of more reliable and effective AI solutions. For example, Accenture's Responsible AI framework is designed to foster innovation while ensuring ethical use of AI. This approach balances the need for cutting-edge technology with the imperative to act responsibly.\n\nIn addition, AI policies support workforce preparedness and development. The rise of AI is reshaping job roles and skill requirements, necessitating new training and education programs. An AI policy can include strategies for workforce development, ensuring employees have the skills needed to work with AI technologies. This is essential for maintaining a competitive edge and for mitigating the potential displacement of workers. For instance, Deloitte's AI Institute focuses on understanding the impact of AI on the workforce and developing strategies to upskill employees, thereby supporting a smooth transition to an AI-driven workplace.\n\nThe importance of having an AI policy is also reflected in the initiatives of industry consortia and standard-setting bodies. Organizations like the Partnership on AI, which includes members such as Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, work to establish best practices and standards for AI. These efforts underscore the collective recognition of the need for responsible AI development and deployment.\n\nIn the end, the necessity for companies to adopt an AI policy cannot be overstated. Such policies provide a framework for addressing ethical concerns, ensuring legal compliance, protecting privacy and data security, fostering transparency and accountability, encouraging innovation, and supporting workforce development. By adopting and adhering to AI policies, companies can harness the transformative potential of AI in a responsible and sustainable manner, ultimately contributing to societal well-being and progress.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed above are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of FINEX\n\nReynaldo C.

The risk categories are:\n\nA variety of obligations apply to high-risk AI systems providers. Key obligations relate to:\n\nGPAI providers are subject to obligations including drawing up technical documentation, copyright policy and publishing data on content used for training. However, GPAI providers may adhere to voluntary codes of practice to be published by the EU AI Office (see further below) to demonstrate compliance.\n\nGPAI systems which carry systemic risk must prepare for model evaluation, ongoing assessment and mitigation of risks, notifying the European Commission (\"Commission\") of such risk and put in place incident reporting and cybersecurity measures.\n\nAI users will have fewer obligations to comply with than AI providers. However, all organisations which use AI must ensure that their staff have some level of AI literacy.\n\nUsers of high-risk AI must ensure they put in place technical and organisational measures, human oversight, monitoring, ensure relevant and representative input data, keep logs and conduct data protection impact assessments. For example, if AI is used in an employment context, employees must be informed of this.\n\nAI systems which create deep fakes, or public interest publications or which involve emotion recognition or biometric categorisation are subject to transparency rules and users must disclose that such systems have been used and that the content created has been artificially generated or manipulated.\n\nThere will be a range of bodies and mechanisms put in place to enforce the AI Act.\n\nAt EU level, the EU AI Office will regulate the implementation of the AI Act across the Member States. The AI Board will comprise of one representative per Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the EU AI Office will observe their meetings but cannot vote. The AI Board will oversee the application of the AI Act and act as an advisory body to the Commission. The Commission will also have powers to implement delegated legislation under the AI Act.\n\nAt national level, national supervisory authorities will have competency to enforce the AI Act. A national public authority with powers to supervise or enforce fundamental rights must be appointed.\n\nThe AI Act provides for significant fines for infringements:\n\nFines for infringement of the AI Act by SMEs will take into account the interests of the SME including their economic viability, and where fines are applied to SMEs, it will be up to the lower of percentages or the amounts referred to above.\n\nThere are special provisions for SMEs to help boost innovation.

However, GPAI providers may adhere to voluntary codes of practice to be published by the EU AI Office (see further below) to demonstrate compliance.\n\nGPAI systems which carry systemic risk must prepare for model evaluation, ongoing assessment and mitigation of risks, notifying the European Commission (\"Commission\") of such risk and put in place incident reporting and cybersecurity measures.\n\nUsers' Obligations\n\nAI users will have fewer obligations to comply with than AI providers. However, all organisations which use AI must ensure that their staff have some level of AI literacy.\n\nUsers of high-risk AI must ensure they put in place technical and organisational measures, human oversight, monitoring, ensure relevant and representative input data, keep logs and conduct data protection impact assessments. For example, if AI is used in an employment context, employees must be informed of this.\n\nAI systems which create deep fakes, or public interest publications or which involve emotion recognition or biometric categorisation are subject to transparency rules and users must disclose that such systems have been used and that the content created has been artificially generated or manipulated.\n\nEnforcement\n\nThere will be a range of bodies and mechanisms put in place to enforce the AI Act.\n\nAt EU level, the EU AI Office will regulate the implementation of the AI Act across the Member States. The AI Board will comprise of one representative per Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and the EU AI Office will observe their meetings but cannot vote. The AI Board will oversee the application of the AI Act and act as an advisory body to the Commission. The Commission will also have powers to implement delegated legislation under the AI Act.\n\nAt national level, national supervisory authorities will have competency to enforce the AI Act. A national public authority with powers to supervise or enforce fundamental rights must be appointed.\n\nFines\n\nThe AI Act provides for significant fines for infringements:\n\nFines for infringement of the AI Act by SMEs will take into account the interests of the SME including their economic viability, and where fines are applied to SMEs, it will be up to the lower of percentages or the amounts referred to above.\n\nSME Supports\n\nThere are special provisions for SMEs to help boost innovation. For example:\n\nTiming\n\nThe provisions of the AI Act are expected to begin to apply from 1 August 2026 with certain exceptions:\n\nFuture Developments\n\nThe AI Act is part of the Commission's three-pronged legal approach to regulating AI. In addition to the AI Act, the proposed AI Liability Directive will set down procedural rules for civil claims concerning AI and the proposed Product Liability Directive will address harm caused by defective AI systems and provide for compensation.\n\nWhat to Do Now\n\nNavigating compliance with the AI Act will present significant strategic and governance challenges which must be met within the relevant timeframes. To ensure compliance and mitigate risks, organisations should proactively:\n\nFootnotes", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Systemic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emotion recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_and_secondary_legislation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary and secondary legislation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Protection_Supervisor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Data Protection Supervisor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.mondaq.com/images/profile/individual/2113920.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The proposal for a Regulation on laying down harmonized rules on Artificial Intelligence (known as the \"AI Act\") was approved by the European Parliament in March 2024.\n\nAt the same time, in January 2024, Commission launched a package of measures to support European startups and Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses in the development of trustworthy AI that respects European Union's values and rules. These measures aim at facilitating and enhancing cooperation on AI across the European Union to boost its competitiveness.\n\nIt is in this context that the creation of the AI Office was announced on May 29, 2024.\n\nThe AI Act, a unique framework in the world\n\nThe overall objective of the AI Act is to protect fundamental rights, democracy, the rule of law and environmental sustainability from high-risk AI, while boosting innovation and establishing Europe as a leader in the field.\n\nIt creates obligations with respect to AI, based on its potential risks and level of impact. For this purpose, 4 risk levels have been identified: minimal risk, limited risk, high risk, and unacceptable risk. It also introduces dedicated rules for general purpose AI models (\"GPAI\").\n\nAs such, the new rules ban some AI applications that threaten citizens' rights, including biometric categorization systems based on sensitive characteristics (race, sexual orientation, political or religious opinions, etc.) and untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases.\n\nEmotion recognition in the workplace and schools, social scoring, predictive policing (when it is based solely on profiling persons or assessing their characteristics), and AI that manipulates human behavior or exploits people's vulnerabilities are also forbidden.\n\nGenerative AI, like ChatGPT, are not classified as high-risk, but must comply with transparency requirements and EU copyright law:\n\nHigh-impact general-purpose AI models that might pose systemic risk, such as the more advanced AI model GPT-4, must undergo thorough evaluations and any serious incidents must be reported to the Commission.\n\nContent that is either generated or modified with the help of AI - images, audio or video files (for example deepfakes) - need to be clearly labelled as AI generated so that users are aware when they come across such content.\n\nThe AI Act should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in June-July 2024.\n\nThe structure of the new AI Office\n\nThe AI Office is part of the Directorate\u2011General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) of the Commission, and will ultimately employ more than 140 staff members, including technology specialists, administrative assistants, lawyers, policy specialists, and economists.\n\nIt consists of 5 Units:\n\nThe AI Office works under the guidance of a Lead Scientific Adviser and an Adviser for International Affairs.\n\nTasks of the AI Office\n\nSupporting the implementation and enforcement of the AI Act\n\nThe AI Office will ensure the coherentimplementation of the AI Act across the Member States.\n\nIt will coordinate the creation of a governance system, including by preparing the establishment of advisory bodies at the EU level and monitoring the establishment of relevant national authorities, and monitor, supervise, and enforce the AI Act requirements on general purpose AI (GPAI) models and systems within the European Union.\n\nConcretely speaking, this includes developing tools, methodologies and benchmarks for evaluating capabilities and reach of GPAI models, and analyzing the emerging unforeseen systemic risks stemming from their development and deployment.\n\nThe AI Office will investigate potential incidents of infringement or non-compliance and, as the case may be, demand corrective actions. It will provide coordination support for joint investigations conducted by one or more competent authorities.\n\nIn cooperation with AI developers, the scientific community and other stakeholders, the AI Office will coordinate the drawing up of state-of-the-art codes of practice with specific, measurable objectives, including key performance indicators, and monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of these codes.\n\nIn his context, the AI Office will prepare guidance and guidelines as well as implementing and delegated acts to support effective implementation of the AI Act and monitor due compliance.\n\nStrengthening the development and use of trustworthy AI\n\nThe AI Office, in collaboration with relevant public and private stakeholders and the startup community, will contribute to this objective by advancing actions and policies to reap the societal and economic benefits of AI across the EU.\n\nIn particular, it will provide technical support, advice and tools enabling ready-access to AI sandboxes, real-world testing and other European support structures for AI uptake, such as the European digital innovation hubs, and the AI factories.\n\nThe AI Act indeed provides that Members States must establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox either independently or by joining other Member States' sandbox(es), within two years from the entry into force of the Act.\n\nThe overall objective is to foster innovation, particularly for Small- and Medium-sized Businesses, by facilitating AI training, testing, and validation, before the placement on the market or the introduction into service, under the competent national authorities' supervision.\n\nSuch supervision is designed to provide legal clarity and improve regulatory expertise. The AI Office must be notified by competent national authorities of any suspension in sandbox testing due to significant risks. These authorities must also submit publicly available annual reports to the AI Office detailing sandbox progress, incidents, and recommendations.\n\nIn addition, the AI Office will develop and maintain a single information platform providing easy to use information for all operators across the European Union, organize appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about the obligations arising from the AI Act, and evaluate and promote the convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems.\n\nFostering international cooperation\n\nThe AI Office will ensure a strategic, coherent and effective European approach on AI at the international level.\n\nTo achieve this, it will:\n\nNecessary cooperation with institutions, experts and stakeholders\n\nTo ensure well-informed decision-making, the AI Office will collaborate with Member States and the wider expert community through dedicated fora and expert groups.\n\nAt the EU-level, the AI Office will work closely with the European Artificial Intelligence Board composed of representatives of Member States.\n\nThe Scientific Panel of independent experts will ensure a strong link with the scientific community and further expertise will be gathered in an Advisory Forum, representing a balanced selection of stakeholders, including industry, startups and SMEs, academia, think tanks and civil society.\n\nThe AI Office may also partner up with individual experts and organizations, and create fora for cooperation of providers of AI models and systems.",

These measures aim at facilitating and enhancing cooperation on AI across the European Union to boost its competitiveness.\n\nIt is in this context that the creation of the AI Office was announced on May 29, 2024.\n\nThe overall objective of the AI Act is to protect fundamental rights, democracy, the rule of law and environmental sustainability from high-risk AI, while boosting innovation and establishing Europe as a leader in the field.\n\nIt creates obligations with respect to AI, based on its potential risks and level of impact. For this purpose, 4 risk levels have been identified: minimal risk, limited risk, high risk, and unacceptable risk. It also introduces dedicated rules for general purpose AI models (\"GPAI\").\n\nAs such, the new rules ban some AI applications that threaten citizens' rights, including biometric categorization systems based on sensitive characteristics (race, sexual orientation, political or religious opinions, etc.) and untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases.\n\nEmotion recognition in the workplace and schools, social scoring, predictive policing (when it is based solely on profiling persons or assessing their characteristics), and AI that manipulates human behavior or exploits people's vulnerabilities are also forbidden.\n\nGenerative AI, like ChatGPT, are not classified as high-risk, but must comply with transparency requirements and EU copyright law:\n\nHigh-impact general-purpose AI models that might pose systemic risk, such as the more advanced AI model GPT-4, must undergo thorough evaluations and any serious incidents must be reported to the Commission.\n\nContent that is either generated or modified with the help of AI - images, audio or video files (for example deepfakes) - need to be clearly labelled as AI generated so that users are aware when they come across such content.\n\nThe AI Act should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in June-July 2024.\n\nThe AI Office is part of the Directorate\u2011General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) of the Commission, and will ultimately employ more than 140 staff members, including technology specialists, administrative assistants, lawyers, policy specialists, and economists.\n\nIt consists of 5 Units:\n\nThe AI Office works under the guidance of a Lead Scientific Adviser and an Adviser for International Affairs.\n\nSupporting the implementation and enforcement of the AI Act\n\nThe AI Office will ensure the coherentimplementation of the AI Act across the Member States.\n\nIt will coordinate the creation of a governance system, including by preparing the establishment of advisory bodies at the EU level and monitoring the establishment of relevant national authorities, and monitor, supervise, and enforce the AI Act requirements on general purpose AI (GPAI) models and systems within the European Union.\n\nConcretely speaking, this includes developing tools, methodologies and benchmarks for evaluating capabilities and reach of GPAI models, and analyzing the emerging unforeseen systemic risks stemming from their development and deployment.\n\nThe AI Office will investigate potential incidents of infringement or non-compliance and, as the case may be, demand corrective actions. It will provide coordination support for joint investigations conducted by one or more competent authorities.\n\nIn cooperation with AI developers, the scientific community and other stakeholders, the AI Office will coordinate the drawing up of state-of-the-art codes of practice with specific, measurable objectives, including key performance indicators, and monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of these codes.\n\nIn his context, the AI Office will prepare guidance and guidelines as well as implementing and delegated acts to support effective implementation of the AI Act and monitor due compliance.\n\nStrengthening the development and use of trustworthy AI\n\nThe AI Office, in collaboration with relevant public and private stakeholders and the startup community, will contribute to this objective by advancing actions and policies to reap the societal and economic benefits of AI across the EU.\n\nIn particular, it will provide technical support, advice and tools enabling ready-access to AI sandboxes, real-world testing and other European support structures for AI uptake, such as the European digital innovation hubs, and the AI factories.\n\nThe AI Act indeed provides that Members States must establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox either independently or by joining other Member States' sandbox(es), within two years from the entry into force of the Act.\n\nThe overall objective is to foster innovation, particularly for Small- and Medium-sized Businesses, by facilitating AI training, testing, and validation, before the placement on the market or the introduction into service, under the competent national authorities' supervision.\n\nSuch supervision is designed to provide legal clarity and improve regulatory expertise. The AI Office must be notified by competent national authorities of any suspension in sandbox testing due to significant risks. These authorities must also submit publicly available annual reports to the AI Office detailing sandbox progress, incidents, and recommendations.\n\nIn addition, the AI Office will develop and maintain a single information platform providing easy to use information for all operators across the European Union, organize appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about the obligations arising from the AI Act, and evaluate and promote the convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems.\n\nFostering international cooperation\n\nThe AI Office will ensure a strategic, coherent and effective European approach on AI at the international level.\n\nTo achieve this, it will:\n\nTo ensure well-informed decision-making, the AI Office will collaborate with Member States and the wider expert community through dedicated fora and expert groups.\n\nAt the EU-level, the AI Office will work closely with the European Artificial Intelligence Board composed of representatives of Member States.\n\nThe Scientific Panel of independent experts will ensure a strong link with the scientific community and further expertise will be gathered in an Advisory Forum, representing a balanced selection of stakeholders, including industry, startups and SMEs, academia, think tanks and civil society.\n\nThe AI Office may also partner up with individual experts and organizations, and create fora for cooperation of providers of AI models and systems.\n\nFootnotes\n\nTo read in French, please click here.", "source":

Other institutions are also involved in the enforcement of the AI Act, such as the European Artificial Intelligence Board (AI Board), the scientific panel established under the AI Act and, with regard to institutions and bodies of the European Union falling in scope of the AI Act regarding their use of AI, the European Data Protection Supervisor.\n\nRole and setup of the AI Office\n\nThe AI Office, established within the European Commission's Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT), is supposed to not only play a major role in the enforcement of the AI Act, but also with regard to promoting an innovative ecosystem of trustworthy AI by ensuring a coherent European approach on AI at an international level.\n\nRegarding the enforcement of the AI Act, the European Commission, acting through its AI Office, has exclusive powers to supervise compliance with, and enforce, the provisions that apply to GPAI (including in respect of sanctions for non-compliance). It will also help with the coordination and cooperation of enforcement activity at Member State level, in particular with regard to joint investigations that may be carried out between (or together with) national market surveillance authorities of different Member States in cross-border scenarios (Article 74(11) AI Act). In certain cases, it can also overrule decisions of national market surveillance authorities, where a market surveillance authority of another Member State objects to the measure, or if it considers the measure taken by the national authority to be contrary to Union law ('Union safeguard procedure').\n\nWith the recently unveiled structure of the AI Office, the European Commission aims to ensure continuity and coherence on the implementation of the AI Act, with several staff from the existing DG CNECT AI Directorate having been deployed to the AI Office. In fact, the AI Office is headed by Lucilla Sioli, former DG CNECT Director for AI, who will work under the guidance of a lead scientific adviser who still needs to be appointed and an adviser for international affairs to represent the AI Office in global conversations on convergence towards common approaches. The latter position is held by Juha Heikkil\u00e4, former DG CNECT Advisor for International Affairs.\n\nWithin the AI Office, five different units have been set up covering the following key aspects: (i) compliance, (ii) safety, (iii) excellence, (iv) international engagement and (v) innovation. It is worth flagging that key EU policymakers who have been involved in the negotiations of the AI Act are heading some of these units, such as Kilian Gross, who will be in charge of ensuring uniform application and enforcement as well as contributing to investigations and possible infringements. A dedicated unit focused on the risks of very capable GPAI models and in charge of developing the codes of conduct required under the AI Act will be headed by one of the lead negotiators from the European Parliament, Dragos Tudorache.\n\nEnforcement at EU Member State level\n\nApart from the AI Office with its exclusive power regarding GPAI rules, each EU Member State has to appoint or establish at least one market surveillance authority and one notifying authority in order to supervise the application and implementation of the AI Act (Article 70(1) AI Act) except for the GPAI-related provisions (see above). Between these types of authorities, the market surveillance authority in particular is responsible for enforcing the AI Act, while the notifying authority carries out conformity assessment-related tasks.\n\nThe market surveillance authorities have extensive competences in the areas of surveillance, investigation and enforcement (see Article 74 AI Act in conjunction with Article 14 Market Surveillance Regulation (2019/1020/EU)). This includes, inter alia, the power to require providers, deployers and importers of AI systems to provide relevant data for assessing the AI system's compliance (including, under certain conditions, access to the source code of high-risk AI systems) and to require them to take appropriate action to bring instances of non-compliance to an end or, where the latter fails, to take appropriate corrective action itself (including the power to prohibit or restrict the making-available of an AI system).\n\nEU Member States will still have to enact implementing rules on penalties and other enforcement measures (which may also include warnings and non-monetary measures) within the framework provided by the AI Act and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that those rules are properly and effectively implemented.\n\nAI Board and scientific panel\n\nNot to be confused with the AI Office, the AI Board, composed of one representative per Member State, is supposed to advise and assist the European Commission/the AI Office and the Member States in order to facilitate the consistent and effective application of the AI Act. With regard to the enforcement of the AI Act, this applies in particular to the enforcement of the rules on GPAI. To ensure the involvement of the AI Board, the AI Act provides for various information, notification and consultation obligations between the AI Office and/or the national market surveillance authorities and the AI Board (see, for example, Articles 75(2) and 90(2) AI Act).\n\nSimilar to the AI Board, a scientific panel of independent experts which will be established under the AI Act also has a supporting function vis-\u00e0-vis the AI Office and the national market surveillance authorities regarding the enforcement of the activities under the AI Act and can, in particular, issue so-called 'qualified alerts' to the AI Office in case of identified systemic risks in GPAI models.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAfter we have taken a closer look here at the AI Office and (other) key actors involved in the enforcement of the AI Act, we will explore one of the most well-known standards already existing in relation to AI: ISO 42001 on the AI management system, in the next post of our blog series.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_surveillance_(products)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market surveillance (products)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Protection_Supervisor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Data Protection Supervisor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Code of conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Source code"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

As AI continues to advance at a breakneck pace, it's crucial for tech professionals to understand its current state and future potential.\n\nIn this post, we'll explore how AI is transforming software development practices, driving innovation, and reshaping the tech landscape. Most importantly, we'll emphasize how AI is not replacing humans, but rather empowering those who embrace it to become dramatically more efficient and productive.\n\nAI is rapidly becoming an indispensable tool for developers, automating repetitive tasks and freeing up time for more creative and strategic work. Here are some concrete examples:\n\nA team at Spotify used AI to automate the creation of data pipelines, reducing the time to deploy new data feeds from days to minutes. This allowed data scientists to focus on analysis rather than data preparation, significantly accelerating their workflow.\n\nAI-powered coding assistants are becoming increasingly sophisticated, offering context-aware suggestions that can dramatically speed up the coding process. These tools are not replacing developers, but rather augmenting their capabilities:\n\nA developer reported that by using GitHub Copilot, they were able to complete a task in 2 hours that would have typically taken 2 days. This 800% increase in productivity aligns with my experience of AI, making me 400-500% more efficient over the last 2 years.\n\nThe rise of AI in software development is creating new roles and demanding new skillsets:\n\nCompanies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have created entire departments dedicated to AI ethics, hiring philosophers and ethicists to work alongside their engineers.\n\nTo remain competitive in the AI-driven tech industry, continuous learning is crucial:\n\nA software engineer at a financial services company reported that after completing Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera and participating in several Kaggle competitions, they were able to transition into a machine learning engineer role, increasing their salary by 30%.\n\nAI is enabling the development of software that can learn, adapt, and improve over time:\n\nGrammarly uses AI to provide real-time writing suggestions, helping millions of users improve their writing skills and productivity. The tool not only corrects grammar and spelling but also offers style and tone improvements, demonstrating how AI can augment human capabilities.\n\nAI is revolutionizing how we optimize and maintain software:\n\nGoogle uses AI to manage cooling in its data centers, resulting in a 40% reduction in energy used for cooling. This not only saves money but also significantly reduces environmental impact.\n\nAs AI becomes more integral to software development, ethical considerations are paramount:\n\nIBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit is an open-source library that helps detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models. This demonstrates how the tech industry is actively working to address ethical concerns in AI development.\n\nThe AI revolution is not about replacing developers, engineers, and architects. Instead, it's about empowering those who embrace AI to become dramatically more efficient and productive. As we've seen through numerous examples, AI is already making people's lives simpler and easier, from writing assistance to personalized recommendations and predictive maintenance.\n\nRemember, AI will not replace people. People who use AI will replace people who do not.

It's a technology that's seemingly everywhere and that everyone's talking about. So why isn't AI already widely adopted for work? And how can you engage your workforce to embrace AI in their jobs? Read on for insights from the \"2024 HP Work Relationship Index\" that decode the common challenges to AI adoption and show you how to cut through all the hype and empower your workforce to embrace AI.\n\nAt a time when hybrid and remote work are blurring the lines between home and office, it's no wonder people are struggling to maintain work-life harmony. As workloads increase, they eat into the time we used to have to run errands and plan our lives.\n\nLeverage AI to save time\n\nPeople shouldn't view using AI as one more thing on their to-do list. Instead, help them embrace it as a useful solution to work and personal lives that are becoming increasingly intertwined. Help people reclaim their time and focus on more meaningful work by encouraging them to use AI as their personal assistant for both work and life tasks. After all, AI is there to fuel personal productivity, using powerful performance to adapt workflows that create more time and space in the day to do more of the tasks that drive growth in a fulfilling way.\n\nLike with many new technologies -- especially ones with this much media buzz -- people worry that AI will be used to replace them. In fact, 36% of knowledge workers in mature economies worry AI will replace their job [1]. This is understandable, especially when AI's capabilities are viewed in broad terms such as, \"It can write articles,\" or \"It can carry on conversations with customers.\"\n\nIncrease worker value with AI\n\nFirst and foremost, communicate. Provide confident leadership and clear information about what your business hopes to gain from AI and how it can empower teams, not replace them. Help them view AI as a tool they can use to drive individual development as well as organizational innovation -- to work better and more strategically. For example, by offloading tedious and repetitive tasks to AI, they can focus on the more meaningful and rewarding aspects of their work and life.\n\nThe potential for AI to make our jobs easier and more enjoyable hinges on one thing: being able to use it effectively in that capacity. Understanding how and when AI can enhance tasks alleviates concerns and builds confidence in its benefits.\n\nInspire an AI-savvy workforce\n\nIt's not enough for organizations to tell employees they can and should use AI. Clear guidance and training on how to apply AI need to come from the top. When polled, many business leaders agreed. AI has so many uses that drive creativity and enhance personalization, it's hard to know where to start. Creatives could use it to turn ideas into images or to easily edit photos. Marketing managers could use it to create frameworks or optimize campaigns. Analysts could use it to quickly process data and identify trends. It's best to set parameters and provide training.\n\nRead the full guide from HP here.\n\n[1] HP, \"Work Relation Index: AI in the Workplace Report,\" March 2024, https://publish-pro.hp.com/content/dam/sites/worldwide/apps/work-relationship-index/reports/ ai-in-the-workplace/us-en_ai-in-the-workplace.pdf", "source": {"uri": "cio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CIO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Empower-your-workforce-to-embrace-AI-.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It emphasizes the need for a \"fair, open, inclusive and nondiscriminatory business environment\" in AI development and deployment, potentially reshaping global trade dynamics in the tech sector.\n\n\"The resolution supports efforts to export U.S. AI technology to developing countries,\" Ed Watal, founder and principal at Intellibus, told PYMNTS. \"This can be thought of as a conduit to enable Chinese firms that need access to those technologies to get them through these other nations, provided they have operations in these developing countries.\"\n\nThe push for technological equity could have far-reaching implications for global trade patterns and economic relations in the AI sector. Observers suggest that the balance of power between rich and developing countries in AI may depend on rules that have yet to be set. The U.N. and groups like the World Digital Governance are creating guidelines covering policies, regulations, shared language, standards and ethics. How these rules are defined will affect which countries have AI development and use advantages.\n\n\"Policymakers need to make sure these regulations don't strangle innovation,\" SecurityPal founder and CEO Pukar Hamal told PYMNTS. \"We need rules that protect the tech industry without suffocating its growth. We're still in the early days of AI -- the infrastructure, architecture and approaches are just getting started. We need to give innovation a chance to take root.\"\n\nHamal emphasized the potential drawbacks of stringent rules, particularly for new entrants in the AI field.\n\n\"If regulations are too tight, incumbent companies will end up with a massive data advantage, leaving new startups out in the cold and unable to improve their products and services,\" he said.\n\nThe resolution's emphasis on a non-discriminatory business environment for AI development will likely affect international investment flows and market dynamics.\n\n\"A non-discriminatory business environment is an ideal condition for AI,\" Watal said. \"It allows the best talent in the world to collaborate speedily and effectively to produce the next generation of AI.\"\n\nHe predicted shifts in global AI investment patterns.\n\n\"International investments will likely go to cities [or nations] that become the 'AI Capital of the World,'\" he said. \"Organizations or locations that can position themselves as the 'destination for AI' will win this economic race.\"\n\nWatal even suggested a potential reshaping of the AI landscape.\n\n\"Silicon Valley is up for a challenge as the next AI destination may be an island with the greatest weather, beautiful oceans and villas where a handful of the smartest AI engineers live and reshape the world,\" he said.\n\nDespite the collaborative nature of the U.N. resolution, geopolitical tensions continue to simmer beneath the surface. Chinese officials have criticized U.S. proposals to restrict investments in Chinese AI and semiconductor sectors, urging them to lift these perceived sanctions. The tension highlights the delicate balance between national security concerns and promoting open, global innovation in AI.\n\nHamal suggested a way forward for companies navigating this complex landscape.\n\n\"To stay competitive on the global stage, tech companies must focus on innovation and agility and tackle challenges like super alignment among AI systems,\" he said. \"Overly stringent regulations could chill the startup ecosystem, preventing new companies from entering the market and stifling the diversity of ideas that drive progress and address these challenges.\"\n\nAs AI capabilities advance, the U.N.'s measures represent initial steps toward establishing a global framework for responsible AI development and use.\n\nHamal advised a proactive approach.\n\n\"Companies should bake compliance into their innovation processes from the start, developing technologies with built-in safeguards and ethical considerations,\" he said. \"Open dialogue with regulators can help shape more practical, effective rules.\"\n\nThe long-term impacts on global trade, technological innovation and geopolitical dynamics remain to be seen. Still, it's evident that the race to shape the future of AI -- and, by extension, the future of global commerce -- is intensifying on the world stage.\n\nAs Watal said, \"While AI has a lot of promise, it still is nascent in its capabilities, applications, and real business or life impact at scale.\"", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Watal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equal opportunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_power_(international_relations)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance of power (international relations)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_and_Society", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business and Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/United-Nations-AI-regulations-China.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 53, "textEnd": 59}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

A Chinese expert said that China's prominent performance noted in the report once again underscores the country's global leading position in AI development and innovation, despite relentless efforts by the Biden administration to curb China in areas such as chips and AI technology.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2023, there were 54,000 generative AI inventions globally, with over 25 percent emerging in last year alone, according to the report. During the period, China led with over 38,000 generative AI inventions, six times more than the second-ranked U.S., which had only 6,276 inventions, with South Korea following in third place with 4,155.\n\nIt is worth noting that according to the report six out of the top ten applicants for generative AI patents globally are Chinese enterprises or institutions. Tencent, Ping An Group, Baidu and the Chinese Academy of Sciences rank in the top four, with the U.S. tech giant IBM placing in the fifth.\n\nIn defining the generative AI, the report said that it allows users to create text, images, music and computer code, powering a range of industrial and consumer products, including chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Baidu's ERNIE. As an emerging field, generative AI patents currently account for only 6 percent of all AI patents globally, the report said, indicating a great potential for growth.\n\nThe Chinese expert said that the WIPO's report shows the efforts that China has made in boosting its AI capabilities over the years.\n\nOver the past decade, from research institutes to enterprises, China has consistently kept pace with the forefront of the world in AI, demonstrating significant efforts and discoveries in this field, Ma Jihua, a veteran telecom industry observer, told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that \"the substantial number of patents is a direct reflection of China's efforts in the field of AI innovation.\"\n\nIn recent years, this trend has become even more pronounced as AI has rapidly driven the development of related industrial ecosystems. Chinese companies such as Baidu and Alibaba are intensifying their efforts to expand their presence in this booming field.\n\nDespite U.S. relentless efforts to suppress China in the AI field, including export controls on high-end NVIDIA chips, AI development in China is thriving. This success is attributed to its vast application market, early-stage investments and supportive government policies, among other factors, experts said.\n\n\"China possesses a significant advantage with a vast annual production and the widest application scope of internet-based services globally, providing a good condition for the development of AI,\" Ma said.\n\nMoreover, China's emphasis on talent development also plays an important part in driving its AI innovation growth. By certain measures, China has surpassed the U.S. as the largest producer of AI talent. According to recent research from MacroPolo, a think tank run by the Paulson Institute in the U.S., China has by some metrics eclipsed the U.S. as the biggest producer of AI talent, with the country generating almost half the world's top AI researchers. By contrast, about 18 percent come from U.S. undergraduate institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, China has expanded its domestic AI talent pool over the last few years to meet the demands of its own growing AI industry. According to the U.S. think tank, China produces a sizable portion of the world's top AI researchers -- rising from 29 percent in 2019 to 47 percent in 2022.\n\nThe WIPO's report also reflects China's contribution in being an important leading player in the AI innovation to the world.\n\nOn Monday, the 78th UN General Assembly adopted a China-led resolution on enhancing international AI cooperation, with over 140 countries supporting it. This highlights global consensus on AI governance and China's leadership, aiming for inclusive and sustainable AI development, the Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nChina's development in AI has huge potential, however, the industry is still in the early stages and requires global cooperation not confrontation for win-win development. Instead of attempting to curb China in AI development, the U.S. should put more focus on advancing its own capabilities in the field, Ma said.", "source": {"uri": "ecns.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China News \u4e2d\u56fd\u65b0\u95fb\u7f51"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Intellectual_Property_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Intellectual Property Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baidu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tencent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_An_Insurance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ping An Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alibaba Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

There is a real risk that AI systems used in recruitment may perpetuate historic biases, e.g. against women or people of certain races, and using AI systems to monitor an individual's employment performance risks interfering with their fundamental rights and privacy. Note that, in common with the provisions governing high-risk AI systems, the key employment-related provisions will not apply for another two years from the date the Act enters into force.\n\nWhy does the AI Act matter to UK employers now that we have left the EU?\n\nWhilst the AI Act may not be relevant to all UK employers, those who have a European footprint and intend to utilise the same AI systems across all territories may well decide to put in place similar arrangements in the UK to those required in EU states. It is expected that the EU's approach to AI will set a minimum global standard for regulation.\n\nFurther, the AI Act applies if the output of an AI system is to be used within the EU, so any UK-based employers who target, or accept applications from, EU-based candidates will need to comply with the AI Act to the extent they use AI as part of their recruitment process,\n\nWhat is a high-risk AI system?\n\nAs described in this article, the AI Act identifies certain AI uses as \"high-risk\", which means that they pose a significant threat to a person's health, safety, or fundamental rights, and are therefore subject to stricter regulation. Various employment-related uses of AI are deemed high-risk. They fall broadly into two categories:\n\nAre there any exceptions?\n\nIf an AI system does not \"pose a significant risk of harm, to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons\" then it will not be deemed high-risk. The AI Act gives four specific examples of when a system will fall within this exception/derogation, all of which could potentially be relevant to HR-related AI systems. For example, an AI system intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity, or an AI system intended to carry out a narrow procedural task.\n\nFurther guidelines on high-risk AI systems are to be published by the Commission 18 months from entry into force of the AI Act. These will include practical examples of what would and wouldn't be considered a high-risk system, so this will hopefully provide clarity on what will fall within the high-risk derogation.\n\nWhat does this mean for employers using or considering the use of AI systems as part of their HR processes?\n\nMost of the obligations relating to high-risk AI systems fall on providers, who are those that develop AI systems or have them developed in their name. In summary, providers of AI systems are required to design systems that have appropriate risk management systems in place;\n\nMost employers will be \"deployers\" for the purpose of the AI Act. The key obligations for deployers of high-risk AI systems are:\n\nIs there anything else employers should be aware of?\n\nWhilst the majority of HR AI use cases will fall within the high-risk category, there are also certain uses that are entirely prohibited. The prohibition most relevant to employers is the restriction on using AI systems to infer emotions in the workplace. Certain AI-powered video interview software already on the market that analyses a job candidate's facial expression may well fall within this category.\n\nKeep an eye out for our future updates on the AI Act as further guidance is published by the Commission.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Roulette", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Roulette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Gain essential insights about GenAI and expand your network at this exclusive three day event. Learn More\n\nSalesforce has unveiled an AI model that punches well above its weight class, potentially reshaping the landscape of on-device artificial intelligence. The company's new xLAM-1B model, dubbed the \"Tiny Giant,\" boasts just 1 billion parameters yet outperforms much larger models in function-calling tasks, including those from industry leaders OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThis David-versus-Goliath scenario in the AI world stems from Salesforce AI Research's innovative approach to data curation. The team developed APIGen, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality, diverse, and verifiable datasets for training AI models in function-calling applications.\n\n\"We demonstrate that models trained with our curated datasets, even with only 7B parameters, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Benchmark, outperforming multiple GPT-4 models,\" the researchers write in their paper. \"Moreover, our 1B model achieves exceptional performance, surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-3 Haiku.\"\n\nSmall but mighty: The power of efficient AI\n\nThis achievement is particularly noteworthy given the model's compact size, which makes it suitable for on-device applications where larger models would be impractical. The implications for enterprise AI are significant, potentially allowing for more powerful and responsive AI assistants that can run locally on smartphones or other devices with limited computing resources.\n\nThe key to xLAM-1B's performance lies in the quality and diversity of its training data. The APIGen pipeline leverages 3,673 executable APIs across 21 different categories, subjecting each data point to a rigorous three-stage verification process: format checking, actual function executions, and semantic verification.\n\nThis approach represents a significant shift in AI development strategy. While many companies have been racing to build ever-larger models, Salesforce's method suggests that smarter data curation can lead to more efficient and effective AI systems. By focusing on data quality over model size, Salesforce has created a model that can perform complex tasks with far fewer parameters than its competitors.\n\nDisrupting the AI status quo: A new era of research\n\nThe potential impact of this breakthrough extends beyond just Salesforce. By demonstrating that smaller, more efficient models can compete with larger ones, Salesforce is challenging the prevailing wisdom in the AI industry. This could lead to a new wave of research focused on optimizing AI models rather than simply making them bigger, potentially reducing the enormous computational resources currently required for advanced AI capabilities.\n\nMoreover, the success of xLAM-1B could accelerate the development of on-device AI applications. Currently, many advanced AI features rely on cloud computing due to the size and complexity of the models involved. If smaller models like xLAM-1B can provide similar capabilities, it could enable more powerful AI assistants that run directly on users' devices, improving response times and addressing privacy concerns associated with cloud-based AI.\n\nThe research team has made their dataset of 60,000 high-quality function-calling examples publicly available, a move that could accelerate progress in the field. \"By making this dataset publicly available, we aim to benefit the research community and facilitate future work in this area,\" the researchers explained.\n\nReimagining AI's future: From cloud to device\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff celebrated the achievement on Twitter, highlighting the potential for \"on-device agentic AI.\" This development could mark a major shift in the AI landscape, challenging the notion that bigger models are always better and opening new possibilities for AI applications in resource-constrained environments.\n\nThe implications of this breakthrough extend far beyond Salesforce's immediate product lineup. As edge computing and IoT devices proliferate, the demand for powerful, on-device AI capabilities is set to skyrocket. xLAM-1B's success could catalyze a new wave of AI development focused on creating hyper-efficient models tailored for specific tasks, rather than one-size-fits-all behemoths. This could lead to a more distributed AI ecosystem, where specialized models work in concert across a network of devices, potentially offering more robust, responsive, and privacy-preserving AI services.\n\nMoreover, this development could democratize AI capabilities, allowing smaller companies and developers to create sophisticated AI applications without the need for massive computational resources.

Systems built with this technology can carry out several tasks that people now accomplish by hand. The intelligence of these systems has increased in recent years.\n\nOfficials in Connecticut have been working to establish what they believe would be the first Citizens AI Academy in the nation. This will be a free online series of specialized classes that will educate fundamental AI concepts and grant the necessary credentials for work.\n\nAccording to sources, Connecticut Democratic Senator James Maroney stated that because AI is changing the workplace so quickly, \"we\" all need to find the greatest resources to stay up to speed and refresh \"our\" skills.\n\nGregory LaBlanc teaches finance, strategy, and law at California's Berkeley Law School's Haas School of Business. He believes that managers and employees should be trained in generative AI.\n\nAccording to LaBlanc, it makes more sense to focus on teaching students how to enhance AI rather than how to become extremely poor imitations of it. At least four states, California, Mississippi, Maryland, and Connecticut, passed legislation this year attempting to address the use of AI in the classroom.\n\nRead Also: \"Godfathers of AI\" Warn Regulations on Booming Technology are Insufficient\n\nAccording to a California bill, math, physics, history, and social science courses must incorporate AI literacy skills, subject to a state working group review.\n\nCalifornia Assemblyman Marc Berman is the author of the measure. In a statement, he asserted that AI could improve several facets of human life.\n\nBerman stated that all students should be taught the essential components and systems of AI and that they should be taught how to recognize when AI is being utilized.\n\nWhile states are looking to train future and current employees in AI, universities are also looking to offer AI programs for students to equip them with future-proof skills.\n\nThe University of South Florida formally announced plans to establish a new college devoted to artificial intelligence in March of this year. The college would provide new graduate and undergraduate degrees, certifications, and other academic alternatives emphasizing computers, cybersecurity, and AI.\n\nAccording to reports, the announcement attempts to position Florida and the Tampa Bay region as national leaders in artificial intelligence, suggesting that it will address the persistent scarcity of AI experts.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school, has also announced that its Engineering and Applied Science Department will offer the first AI degree for an educational institution of its stature this year.\n\nThe program, officially designated as a Bachelor of Science in Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, is being provided at a time when technology is becoming increasingly common in almost every aspect of society.

It's just helping those teachers get past that so they can spend more time on teaching.\"\n\nCollins said AI tuition could lead to more equitable outcomes.\n\n\"So you have your own AI tutor. So instead of having to be wealthy enough to employ a tutor to help the children with the maths or science questions, or something else that the parent doesn't know much about maybe, is to enable that child to have their own (AI) tutor,\" she said.\n\n\"It doesn't do the work for them. It says some things like 'go back, rethink that one, look at that number,' those sorts of things. What an exciting way to do your homework if you're a child.\"\n\nCollins is also eager for AI to be used in the health system and said processing mammogram results was one example.\n\n\"That is the sort of data that is collected all the time and if that can be turned into an AI solution that could instantly tell women whether or not they have something that they need to be concerned about and whether or not they need to go to the next stage of seeing a specialist - instantly, not in a few weeks, not when someone's available, but instantly.\"\n\nDeploying AI in education and health would be seen as high risk uses under new legislation passed by the European Union regulating AI.\n\n\"Examples of high-risk AI uses include critical infrastructure, education and vocational training, employment, essential private and public services (e.g. healthcare, banking), certain systems in law enforcement, migration and border management, justice and democratic processes,\" according to an EU press release when the law was passed in March.\n\nUsing AI in those settings in EU countries must include high levels of transparency, accuracy and human oversight.\n\nThe EU regulation bans certain applications including biometric categorisation systems, scraping internet or CCTV footage to create facial recognition databases, emotion recognition in the workplace and schools and AI that manipulates human behaviour or exploits vulnerabilities.\n\nBut New Zealand has no specific AI regulation and Collins is keen to get productivity gains from extending its use across government, including using it to process Official Information Act requests.\n\n\"It's a perfect example of how we in government could use AI because the rules around Official Information Act requests are very clear. The information or data that government agencies have access to - that can be used to actually provide OIA requests that are not held up any longer than they need to be.\"\n\nAn OIA request by RNZ for a government Cabinet paper on AI was turned down (by a human) on the grounds that the policy is under live consideration.\n\nCollins said AI policy was \"under very active consideration\" now. \"I'm trying to see if we can better use AI in our government services,\" she said.\n\n\"The amount of data that government agencies collect on people is enormous. But do we have any mechanism to make sure that that data is shared sufficiently so that we provide better services for people?\"\n\nShe would not pursue a \"big bang\" approach but wanted to trial the technology in government agencies.\n\n\"I think the health sector and the education sector are both up for it. So they may have to vie for who wants to be first.\"\n\nBut Collins has some work to do in shifting attitudes to AI in Aotearoa.\n\nNew Zealand has the second-highest level of concern among 32 countries surveyed by market research company Ipsos.\n\nTwo-thirds of New Zealanders said AI makes them nervous, behind Ireland on 67 percent and compared with a global average of 50 percent.\n\nIn the survey, released last month, 69 percent of New Zealanders said they had a good understanding of AI and 64 percent thought it would profoundly change their lives in the next three to five years.\n\nJust over half of New Zealanders think AI will make the spread of false information worse - again the second highest level of concern, behind Sweden at 55 percent and compared with a global average of 37 percent.\n\nThere has been concern about how fast AI is developing - even from its creators.\n\nIn March 2023 more than 1000 tech leaders, including Elon Musk, signed an open letter calling for a pause in AI development, warning of profound risks to humanity from an arms race to develop powerful digital minds not even their creators could understand or control.\n\nIn his 2021 book Scary Smart Mo Gawdat, formerly chief business officer of Google X, predicts that by 2049 AI will be a billion times smarter than the smartest human. The gap in intelligence would be similar to that between a fly and Einstein, leading Gawdat to ask, how do you convince the superbeing not to squash the fly?\n\nOne morbid metric sweeping Silicon Valley is P-Doom: the probability of doom, where zero means humanity will be fine and 100 means we're all dead. A survey recently found the average AI engineer had a P-Doom of 40 - meaning a 40 percent chance AI will wipe us out.\n\nBut Collins described herself as an AI optimist. New Zealand could not stop AI so had to embrace it.\n\n\"It's like trying to stop the wind blowing. It's already here and it's going to keep going,\" she said. \"I think we just need to stop being so frightened and actually understand that there are enormous benefits. But we have to also be aware that some people might misuse AI and we have to be ready for that too.\"\n\nUsing voice cloning technology in scams or disinformation and deep fakes to influence opinion were examples of this.\n\nCollins said New Zealand already had privacy and digital identity laws that could be used to counter those uses of AI and the government was \"always willing to regulate\" if that was in the public interest.", "source": {"uri": "business.scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Image Credit: Andrea De Santis/Unsplash)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is altering businesses, economies, and the fundamental fabric of society in today's rapidly evolving digital world. AI technologies are permeating every aspect of human lives. While ranging from virtual assistants to self-driving cars, AI is completely transforming how people work, communicate, and learn. Likewise, learning the concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more crucial for students. Their ability to successfully navigate the future technological environment will be driven by their AI literacy.\n\nTeaching AI literacy should, however, begin in primary school when kids attain the age of ten. Since young minds are usually most receptive to new ideas, it will undoubtedly be of significance to introduce AI effectively as the technology becomes more pervasive in everyday life.\n\nRole Of Educators\n\nWith the advent of ChatGPT and other models, artificial intelligence has taken centre stage for the majority of students in school today. Young kids may not be able to adequately assess the potency of these tools without the right guidance, which might have a variety of detrimental effects. This is where the role of educators comes into play.\n\nA significant role in the development of AI literacy is exercised by both parents and teachers. Nevertheless, they must be knowledgeable about AI themselves in order to carry out this role effectively. They require instruction on the pedagogical, ethical, and sociological facets of AI along with its technical elements.\n\nAlso, educators play an important role in developing an AI-positive learning environment. This entails creating a classroom setting that values research, critical thinking, and ethical reflection about artificial intelligence.\n\nIt involves using diverse approaches to improve learning while critically assessing the use of AI.\n\nSome of them are listed below:\n\nStarting With Basics: It is usually best to begin instructing elementary and middle school kids with the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning. While frequently used interchangeably, they reflect distinct principles whose understanding is essential for present-day technology progress.\n\nAfter that, educators may also provide real-life examples of AI-enabled virtual assistants, most of which they use regularly without even realising they are utilising AI. Giving students a glimpse of how AI is used and influences their daily lives inspires their curiosity and builds a strong platform for future learning.\n\nOnline Resources: There are various free online tools available to help youngsters understand and appreciate artificial intelligence. These platforms can help students gain a hands-on understanding of how AI works, making the subject more accessible and interesting. In addition, these free tools frequently incorporate visually attractive information, quizzes, and real-world examples to keep young students interested throughout classes.\n\nSeveral online tools are available for educators to teach AI literacy to their children, including the Free Basic Courses in AI and ML offered by Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft.\n\nCoding Games: These are a wonderful, engaging approach for youngsters to learn AI fundamentals while having fun. These interactive platforms simplify hard concepts and provide a fun way to show AI foundations while also teaching kids basic coding ideas.\n\nThe use of these games can help students develop problem-solving abilities and creativity as they try to overcome problems in the game using code. Using such an instructive yet interesting approach is certain to attract young minds and kindle their curiosity about solving AI's secrets.\n\nEducators can visit websites such as CodaKid, Scratch, and Blockly, which provide a variety of engaging games for young children to learn about coding fundamentals.\n\nComics: A comic book on AI will make Artificial Intelligence exciting and approachable for kids. It includes engaging storytelling along with vivid illustrations to explain complicated AI concepts in a manner easy to relate to -- one that provokes curiosity and creativity with characters and scenarios.\n\nThe visual format and narrative storylines are better understood and retained with interactive elements encouraging active participation and critical thinking. One of such Comic Book Series available is\"WHY AI\".\n\nHands-On Activities: After students have understood the fundamentals of AI, it's time to introduce them to hands-on exercises. Educators can emphasise the need to teach students the principles of machine learning systems and data structure.\n\nIt will be more helpful for students to apply Python coding and generative AI in real-world applications. Similarly, learners should be encouraged to perform industry-related projects with AI to complete their learning with practical outcomes.\n\nThis type of active learning requires direct engagement with AI systems.\n\nWhat Parents Can Do On AI Privacy\n\nToday, AI systems are continually evaluating children's activities to make predictions and decisions that benefit not just them but also the AI's creators. It's therefore important for educators to teach students the significance of privacy and prudence while dealing with artificial intelligence-driven services available on the internet.\n\nThey can try to describe how their online behaviour affects the AI's response and the information it provides to them, right down to the slightest nuances. For example, certain websites that offer goods or services could alter their rates based on how long a user stays on a page.\n\nA more sinister example is that oversharing personal information on social media may allow AI algorithms to target users with improper content or expose them to real-world threats.\n\nThe incorporation of AI into education can transform traditional teaching techniques, give vital insights for student improvement and provide learners with the skills they need to survive in a technologically driven environment.\n\nFurthermore, AI tools are a strong and interesting technology that may assist children with their academic work across a variety of areas. As a parent or teacher, one can confidently teach children and incorporate AI tools to help them with their schoolwork while communicating and encouraging them to use technology wisely and responsibly.\n\nBy embracing this initiative, educators can harness the full potential of AI in education and prepare students for success in the ever-changing digital world.\n\n(The author is the Director of YuviPep)", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedagogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scratch (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data structure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Python (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/06/21/9812941158b43f8cd709ab2bac7f1ebb1718947830923402_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

In addition, FINMA stated that it has started to conduct on-site inspections and supervisory exchanges with financial institutions using AI. Overall, the challenges posed by AI are not considered to be fundamentally new but can be addressed within the existing frameworks.\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nFINMA has identified four areas in which the use of AI can pose challenges: governance and responsibility, robustness and reliability, transparency and accountability, and non-discrimination. Each challenge has its own implications within the AI lifecycle for financial institutions that decide to implement AI in their processes. Attention should be paid to the implementation of sufficient risk management processes, depending on the intended use case and the associated risks, issuing appropriate internal guidelines, and providing appropriate information about the AI solutions used in the client documentation.\n\nThis means that although the use of AI is on the rise, it is not (yet) possible to use it for fully autonomous decision-making. However, while human oversight remains necessary to ensure sufficient oversight and accountability, AI-based solutions will likely lead to a substantial increase in efficiency, scalability and productivity as the humans involved can focus more on the supervisory function (i.e., diligently assessing investment advice received from an AI solution etc.).\n\nThe oversight of the accountable person requires in-depth knowledge of the respective matter in order be able to critically assess and challenge AI-based results.\n\nAs only time will tell which AI tool is best suited to which task, the choice of tools and the area of application will be crucial in determining the role of AI in the financial industry.\n\nChallenges for the Use of AI in Financial Markets\n\nIn its Risk Monitor 2023, FINMA identified fundamental challenges for the use of AI in the financial industry in four areas: firstly, governance and responsibility; secondly, robustness and reliability; thirdly, transparency and explicability; and finally, non-discrimination.\n\n1. Governance and Responsibility\n\nWhen decisions are based on the results of AI applications, there is an increased risk of errors going unnoticed and a lack of accountability and responsibility. AI models produce results so confidently that they create a false sense of security. If decisions are made based on such results without questioning their validity, undetected errors may occur. When used in complex, organisation-wide decision-making processes, there is an additional risk that no one will feel responsible or is held accountable. Learn more about our expertise in Banking and Insurance.\n\n2. Robustness and Reliability\n\nRisks in the use of AI can also arise from the poor quality of the training data used, incorrect optimisation and IT security risks, which can lead to unreliable or even incorrect results. When AI models are trained, they generalise the statistical information contained in the training data. To avoid unreliable results, the training data must be representative, without significant outliers, and complete, or in other words, of \"good quality\". Good quality data is therefore a prerequisite for accurate results.\n\nMoreover, there is the danger that AI models become less accurate over time, due to mistakes in the self-optimization process. In addition, the use of large amounts of data increases IT security risks when it leads to increased outsourcing and cloud use.\n\n3. Transparency and Explicability\n\nIn AI applications, it is not possible to isolate the impact of individual parameters on the model, making it difficult to explain or verify its results. AI models generalise the statistical information in data sets and calculate the most likely value. As such, their output is based on probabilities rather than causal relationships. With complex models, it becomes increasingly difficult to explain, reproduce or control their output. In addition, on the client side, clients are unable to fully assess the risk of AI if they are not adequately informed about its use. Discover our expertise in Regulatory Compliance.\n\n4. Non-discrimination\n\nThe use of AI applications to make individual predictions about groups of people can lead to unintended and unjustified discrimination if they are based on unrepresentative personal data. Particularly for groups of people who have been historically underrepresented, this can lead to unintended bias and discrimination against them.\n\nFINMA's Supervisory Expectations Applied to the Use Cycle of AI Models\n\nThe use of AI models in the financial industry can be divided into three phases, each with its own challenges that need to be addressed. First, the AI model has to be developed according to the needs of the financial institution. The second stage is to deploy it, and the third stage, is to address any issues that arise during deployment, possibly fix them and adjust the model accordingly. Each stage has different implications for addressing the four previously identified challenges.\n\n1. Development\n\nThe first step is to develop the AI model according to its use case in the organization. This includes defining the scope and objective of the model, designing it accordingly, training and finally testing it. From a regulatory perspective, this phase should define the responsible parties and the risk management processes, which must always take into account the specific environment and use case of the model and the associated risks. Reference can be made, for example, to the abstract requirements laid down in FINMA's Circular 2023/1 on operational risks and resilience for banks.\n\nThe board of directors must regularly approve strategies on how to deal with AI. Internally recognised standards, competencies and responsibilities must be defined. The development and test environments of the AI models must be separated from the rest of the IT infrastructure and must consider the underlying responsibilities. The AI models themselves must be tested and validated according to the risk associated to their use case. The design of the model should consider mandatory legal requirements to ensure that it does not violate any domestic or, where applicable, foreign legislation. If external infrastructure is used, such as cloud services, the increased risk associated therewith must be addressed with appropriate measures. Overall, this first stage involves a forward-looking, ex-ante consideration of potential risks and the definition of appropriate processes to address them.\n\n2. Deployment and Monitoring\n\nIn the second stage, the developed AI model is deployed. Once deployed, the model needs to be continuously monitored and evaluated according to the risk management processes defined in the development phase. Attention should be paid to the accuracy, robustness and reliability of the results. Systematic collection and analysis should be put in place. This will allow results to be tracked and errors to be corrected. The responsible person must actively review the results and not just \"rubber stamp\" any output. This is a prerequisite if the AI model is to be used in an automated decision-making process. When reviewing the results, the responsible person ensures that they are sufficiently explainable. As such, the AI model can never make a decision on its own but can only support a decision-making process. This is important because AI models are based on probabilities, not causality, but decisions should be explainable based on causalities.\n\nDuring implementation, care should be taken to inform clients about the use of AI. As AI models are often very complex, providing the right information can be a challenge. On the one hand, the information needs to be detailed enough so that the use of the model can be understood. On the other hand, clients often lack knowledge about how AI works and may be overwhelmed by too much detail. So, there is a balance to be struck between providing enough detail without defeating the purpose of the information. However, it is not only external transparency that is important, but also internal transparency about the use, processes, responsibilities, risks, and limitations within the financial institution.\n\n3. Adjustment and Remedies\n\nThe third stage involves continuous adjustment of the model according to the feedback collected during its deployment. This stage involves a backward-looking, ex-post perspective to remedy risks that have materialized.

But as these AI tools enter the market, how are we managing the ethical and cultural dilemmas that arrive alongside them? From the broad societal fears and anxieties AI has raised, to the risks of irresponsible usage, it's essential to approach AI with a clear sense of what can go wrong.\n\nCarter Cousineau, the vice-president of responsible AI at Thomson Reuters, sees a number of key concerns around AI today. These include fears of privacy loss and digital manipulation, and apprehension around fairness and bias. When it comes to bringing AI into knowledge resources, Cousineau sees governance work as critical to building trusted AI-enabled systems.\n\n\"When you're looking at integrating AI into systems where trusted knowledge and content resources are foundational, governance work is essential,\" he says.\n\n\"Ensuring AI-driven processes are accountable, transparent and aligned to ethical standards.

A report from Gartner last year even discussed the hype surrounding generative AI and said the technology was at the 'peak of inflated expectations' section on the emerging technology 'Hype Cycle'.\n\nBut while generative AI has drawn attention to this tech and its various use cases, AI itself is not a new concept and some people have been excited about its potential for a long time.\n\nOne of those people is Angie Ma, the co-founder of Faculty, a tech company that provides software, consulting and services related to AI. This company was founded in 2014 and has grown into an entity of 400 staff with various clients, including some government contracts.\n\nMa said her journey into AI began around 18 years ago, as her and Faculty co-founder Marc Warner would meet with some of the eventual founders of DeepMind to discuss AI and AI safety.\n\n\"I actually got into AI because of AI safety,\" Ma said. \"Even then, I think it was mind-blowing, and I was convinced that the technology would be transformative for the society.\"\n\nMa's role in Faculty involves shaping the company's strategic direction and building relationships with customers, collaborators, partners and media. She describes co-founding Faculty as her biggest achievement, being \"the hardest thing I've ever done, but also the most rewarding\".\n\n\"I think over 10 years, some of the stuff that we have delivered are nationally and internationally important,\" she said. \"So you make a lot of sacrifices personally as well to do it. So yeah, I would say naive optimism is how usually people do start-ups.\"\n\nThe phases of AI\n\nSince co-founding Faculty, Ma believes there have been different phases in terms of how people approached AI. She said the first three to five years was a \"proof of concept\" phase, where people appeared to be testing how this tech could be applied.\n\nFrom around 2017 onwards, Ma said this changed to a more \"operationalised\" phase, where companies began implementing AI \"into business and the everyday running of a business\".\n\nOver the past couple of years, Ma said the technology witnessed a \"breakthrough\" through the rise of generative AI and she anticipates that there will be increased adoption of the technology and AI breakthroughs as a result.\n\nThere is evidence that employees across various sectors are embracing the use of AI in the workplace, despite some concerns of the impact the technology could have on certain jobs. Though a recent Microsoft Index report suggests Irish employers may be falling behind on the AI wave, causing many workers to jump ship.\n\nReaping real rewards from AI\n\nMa is no stranger to AI, but noted that there has been an \"unprecedented\" surge in interest in recent years. But she also believes there is a danger that industries \"and wider society\" are in \"a bit of an AI hype\".\n\n\"There's so many cases, but I think what I've really seen that where organisations truly benefit from AI is that they see it more than just a shiny, cool toy,\" Ma said. \"They actually sort of really integrate that into their core business strategy processes, align it with really clear business outcomes.\n\n\"I think through those lenses, all the AI initiatives or efforts become valuable and collectively transformational for the organisations.\"\n\nDespite the hype surrounding the sector and some of the more questionable uses of AI that are being witnessed, Ma believes that AI remains a very important technology that will lead to some major improvements.\n\n\"I'm a physicist by training, but I got into AI because I do believe that it's the transformative technology of our time that will touch upon every aspect of lives,\" Ma said. \"So, it's already sort of being used in many aspects of our lives, from the very old-school spam filters to AI recommending, to stabilising our photos when we take photos without our phone.\n\n\"But I think the biggest opportunities are in a few areas. I think AI has really got the potential to improve the effectiveness and how we experience public service, healthcare and life sciences, from improving the NHS to speeding up clinical trials, speeding up drug discovery.\"\n\nMa also believes that AI will be a \"real game changer\" in terms of helping with the \"energy transition\" and support the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nHowever, a recent report by Google suggests AI can be a problem when it comes to energy - the tech giant's emissions have surged by nearly 50pc since 2019, which Google attributed to a growth in data centres and AI.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

We may be allowing it to run unattended for low-level matters, such as keeping computer viruses at bay or managing car-sharing engagements, but we'll never leave it alone for most mid-level and high-level tasks.\n\nThat's the consensus of a range of industry leaders, who acknowledge that there will always need to be humans checking or even squashing AI-originated output. This means humans will always be needed to potentially override AI output, be it making hires, recommending business action, or making medical decisions.\n\nThe importance of human oversight in any AI-driven recommendation process is acknowledged by leaders of even the most technologically savvy companies in the world. Diya Wynn, responsible AI lead at Amazon Web Services, recalled how she witnessed the importance of human intervention when AI was used to help determine her father's health conditions and develop a care plan. \"The doctor reviewed the output, didn't agree with some of the recommendations, and ultimately made the final decision based on his own experience and expertise,\" she said.\n\nMoments such as these \"underscores the importance of AI as a tool to augment human expertise, not replace it,\" she added. \"It's not one or the other. By working together, humans and AI can achieve better outcomes.\"\n\nThe threshold for human intervention in AI decisions is likely set at a low level. \"AI has been embedded in everyday applications for many years,\" Wynn said. \"AI helps us discover new products and keep spam out of our inboxes. Generally speaking, people trust these low-risk use cases.\"\n\nSuch low-risk use cases may also now include \"automatically generating or adjusting purchase requisitions to procure and replenish inventory across the supply chain,\" says Sudarshan Seshadri, corporate vice president of Generative AI for Blue Yonder.\n\nAt the same time, he agrees \"we're not ready for large-scale, fully autonomous decisions.\" Rather, AI \"is a journey, with companies enabling varying levels of autonomy based on the degree of complexity across their supply chain. Trust will come with time.\"\n\nFor example, \"while large language models offer a great start for supply chain challenges, they lack the business process context that's required to meaningfully analyze data, orchestrate problem resolution, and offer meaningful, actionable and accurate responses,\" Seshadri continued.\n\nFor critical use of AI \"that impacts our lives and even rights, we need humans in command,\" Wynn said. \"This means humans must be accountable to assess risks and make informed decisions about the necessary level of oversight before allowing the AI-powered product or service to go into production.\"\n\nThat's not to say that as AI becomes more pervasive, and trust in AI grows, there could be a gradual letting go of some functions where AI proves its prowess. \"Think of AI as a new hire,\" says Forrest Zeisler, chief technology officer and co-founder at Jobber. During the initial period, \"you need to review all the new employee's output until the person has proven they can perform the task without errors. Then, you can lessen the oversight. Reversible tasks will gain trust quickly, while one-way doors will take longer before we step back.\"\n\nAs operational and generative AI technology \"improves, becomes more tested, and human confidence in it grows, processes that are more routine and lower risk can be left largely automated,\" says Manish Garg, co-founder at Skan.ai. This will allow \"human employees to focus on more meaningful work and be more productive.\"\n\nAt this time, trust is low, Zeisler adds. At his own company, \"we s AI responding independently more and more, but a human will still need to review aspects of the output. For example, if a conversation with a customer through our chatbot needs to be evaluated against a number of characteristics and escalated when appropriate.\"\n\nHaving a human at the AI switch will be a business necessity for a number of reasons. \"For example, if you ask a large language model an inappropriate question related to hate speech, it'll likely give you an inappropriate answer if it doesn't have safeguards in place,\" Wynn cautions. \"This could be damaging to a business or organization's brand reputation, and upset employees and customers.\"\n\nCould AI itself help facilitate human oversight? Garg advocates AI-assisted oversight into organizations' AI systems. This includes \"integrated mechanisms such as a compliance and alerting cockpit, which enables users to monitor all actions taken in a process,\" he explains. \"This can be seen in the front-end UI.\"\n\nManual oversight is problematic as \"humans can only sample and audit outcomes at scale,\" says Garg. Once the AI understands the process and a user's behavior, \"human users can identify in real-time any faulty behavior or anomalies that could indicate a risk for security or compliance breaches.\"\n\nOrganizationally, humans need to be in the loop \"throughout the AI lifecycle, including design and development, deployment, and ongoing use,\" Wynn urges. \"During the design phase, AI developers should ensure their company's values align with an AI application or service's goals, and solicit input from their colleagues.\"\n\nAs things move on to the development phase, AI teams will \"need to curate diverse, robust training data to ensure fair, accurate, and compliant outputs,\" she continues. \"For ongoing use, end users can leverage AI-generated content to improve different aspects of their lives, but they are still ultimately the decision makers. People remain critical to building and using AI responsibly.\"\n\nZeisler points to the factory process Jidoka used by Toyota, \"where any worker can stop the assembly line if they see a problem. It's a philosophy we share at Jobber. I'm a big believer in anyone being able to hit the stop button if something doesn't look or feel right. Responding quickly is more important than avoiding false positives. This is as true for AI as for human-made decisions,\" he says.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spamming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger_Management", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/639cee1eba8c17f97ef31824/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Nevertheless, just 8% reported using AI for five or more business functions - suggesting that we are still in the initial stages of AI integration.\n\nAI can be applied to a wide spectrum of activities, from routine and repetitive tasks to knowledge-based and creative work. It has been argued that AI is a general-purpose technology - akin to the steam engine, electricity or the computer - with the potential to transform our economies in the long run.\n\nBut, like the computer before it, AI may involve a paradox similar to the one made famous by the economist Robert Solow: \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\"\n\nThe dawn of the computer era saw information and communication technology (ICT) profoundly alter our personal lives and the economy. Today, our workplaces, homes and social lives are interwoven with digitalisation.\n\nAt the European Central Bank (ECB), our Information Systems department has become the largest business area within the institution. ICT has become key to our core tasks, from the economic models that underpin our forecasts to monetary policy implementation and the operation of market infrastructures.\n\nYet technology has not fundamentally changed the way we think about monetary policy. Moreover, just as Solow observed, the macroeconomic impact of ICT on productivity has not been as large as might have been expected - at least outside of the tech sector.\n\nIndeed, the transformative potential of AI may not always be productivity-enhancing. Consider, for example, a recent AI-generated deepfake video of the actor Tom Cruise dressed in a bathrobe and singing Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer\" to Paris Hilton that went viral on TikTok.\n\nMight we see another Solow paradox emerge in the context of AI? In other words, what is the potential of AI to boost the productive capacity of the economy, as well as that of central banks?\n\nToday I will take stock of what we know about the impact of AI on the economy and discuss its possible implications for our monetary policy. I will then share the ECB's perspective on how we can best use AI in our central banking tasks, while putting in place the necessary safeguards for its responsible use.\n\nAI could affect the economy in several areas that are particularly relevant for the conduct of monetary policy. Today I will highlight just three of them.\n\nThe first area relates to productivity.\n\nThe potential of AI to raise productivity is undeniable - from acting as a powerful coding assistant to running autonomous \"smart factories\". AI could increase productivity through various channels - for example, via direct productivity effects that boost total factor productivity or through individual production factors.\n\nIndeed, several studies already point to sizeable AI-induced productivity gains at firm level. But estimates of aggregate effects over the coming decade differ markedly across studies - from an increase in annual total factor productivity growth of less than 0.1 percentage points to annual labour productivity growth of up to 1.5 percentage points.\n\nThe eventual outcome will depend on whether we see a rapid and broad-based adoption and diffusion of AI across all sectors of the economy. Up until now, the sheer speed of diffusion across sectors and firms has little historical precedent. And survey evidence suggests that adoption by European firms nearly matches that of North America.\n\nBut a key risk stems from the possibility that most of the value created by AI is extracted by a few companies that end up dominating the AI ecosystem. This is a key reason why productivity gains from AI at firm level may not translate into sustained value-added gains at the aggregate level, as market power increases costs. We saw this happen already with the rise of IT, which resulted in productivity gains being concentrated in the IT sector and primarily benefiting countries with large, successful tech firms. This is also reflected in the unprecedented concentration of market value in the \"Magnificent Seven\" firms in the United States. These are currently benefiting from the AI boom and making higher yearly profits than all the listed companies of France, Germany and Italy combined.\n\nThis has important implications for Europe. As Mario Draghi recently observed, EU productivity growth over the past twenty years would have been on a par with that of the United States if it were not for the tech sector. Current data point to the euro area trailing behind the United States in terms of private investment in AI, as well as patent applications and journal publications in the field. It is therefore critical to devise a European AI strategy with a threefold aim: to preserve competition in the AI space; to create an ecosystem that supports' European AI firms' competitiveness, generating sectoral productivity gains over time; and to support the diffusion of AI across the economy, facilitating the development of AI-supported products and services.\n\nThe labour market is the second area of the economy that is likely to be affected by AI.\n\nNew technologies can substitute or complement labour. On the one hand, automation implies capital taking over a task previously performed by a worker. On the other, productivity tends to increase with the automation of tasks, which may contribute to increased labour demand for non-automated tasks if price reduction brought about by productivity-improving technology spurs strong demand growth. And new technology can lead to the creation of new kinds of jobs. Whether AI represents an opportunity or risk for employment depends on the net effect.\n\nECB staff analysis suggests that around 25% of jobs in European countries are in occupations that are highly exposed to AI-enabled automation, while another 30% have a medium degree of exposure. Other research finds that knowledge-intensive services in particular - including finance and insurance, advertising, consultancy and IT - are most likely to be affected by AI.\n\nInitial evidence for Europe suggests that, on average, occupations more exposed to AI have seen an increase in their share in total employment - although mostly for highly skilled occupations and younger workers, and with significant heterogeneity across countries. But the ultimate impact on employment remains uncertain and is likely to hinge on equipping the workforce with skills that complement AI.\n\nThe third area of the economy that may be affected by AI is financial stability.\n\nCertainly, AI can bring benefits to the table. The application of AI could allow banks to conduct more efficient risk assessments and capital and liquidity planning. But there are also risks. If new AI tools are used widely in the financial system and AI suppliers are concentrated, operational risk, market concentration and too-big-to-fail externalities may increase. Furthermore, widespread AI adoption could heighten the potential for herd behaviour, market correlation, deception, manipulation and conflicts of interest.\n\nCentral banks, including the ECB, are monitoring these developments closely. Not only does AI influence the environment in which we operate, it also affects how that environment interacts with our monetary policy.\n\nFirst, AI could affect cost pressures in the economy in both directions.\n\nWe may see AI exerting downward pressure on prices in various ways. For instance, if the net effect of AI is that it substitutes labour and increases productivity, we could see a reduced risk of labour shortages and downward pressure on unit labour cost growth. This is especially relevant in the euro area, where unemployment is at a record low and the working age population is projected to decline by 19% by the end of the century as a result of population ageing.\n\nAI could also lead to a decline in energy prices through its impact on the supply side, for instance through enhanced grid management and more efficient energy consumption. And it could provide consumers with better tools for price comparison.\n\nBut AI could also create upward price pressures.\n\nFor instance, the uptake of AI will also have an impact on global energy demand, with the computational power required for sustaining AI's rise doubling every 100 days. This could push up energy costs. Moreover, AI may encourage discriminatory pricing by facilitating the real-time analysis of consumer demand and price elasticities. And algorithms consistently learn to charge collusive prices that are higher than competitive ones, even without communicating with one another - in part by exploiting well-known biases that deviate from rational consumer behaviour.\n\nSecond, we may see AI affect monetary policy transmission.\n\nAI is likely to create new winners and losers in the labour and capital market, with consequences for income and wealth distribution. This matters for monetary policy because it can influence people's marginal propensity to consume and their access to credit, which in turn affect how demand responds to changes in monetary policy.\n\nMoreover, if AI leads to a change in financial structures, such as an increase in non-bank intermediation, it may have further implications for monetary policy transmission. There is evidence to suggest that compared with banks, non-banks are more responsive to monetary policy measures that influence longer-term interest rates, such as asset purchases. Non-banks also exhibit higher levels of credit, liquidity and duration risk compared with the banking sector.\n\nThird, AI may go on to influence the natural rate of interest.\n\nIf AI boosts productivity growth and potential output, we may see upward pressure being exerted on the natural rate of interest, as demand increases for capital to invest in new technologies and expand production capabilities.\n\nBut if AI leads to higher rates of labour displacement and causes rising income inequality, we may see some downward pressure on the natural rate, owing to an increase in precautionary savings and a subsequent boost to the supply of loanable funds.\n\nThese developments will play out over time outside the walls of the ECB, and we will be monitoring them closely. But within the ECB's walls, AI also has the potential to help with multiple tasks.\n\nLet me give you a few examples.\n\nGiven that we are here at the National Conference of Statistics, it is fitting to begin with statistics. The ECB needs trustworthy and high-quality statistical products, services and a wide range of data to inform its monetary policy decisions.\n\nA key lesson from the global financial crisis was that aggregate statistics alone are insufficient to grasp the complexity of financial markets. We need more granular data.\n\nAs you can imagine, the resulting datasets are so vast in terms of the number of observations they contain that collecting and disseminating them requires the use of statistical processes and analytical methods that surpass traditional statistical approaches.\n\nAround six years ago the ECB began exploring the application of AI to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its statistical processes. And these efforts are reaping dividends.\n\nWe use AI to improve the quality of our datasets, from identifying and matching observations across datasets to using modern machine learning techniques for quality assurance.\n\nMoreover, large language models (LLMs) can support statistical processes in ways that were once simply not feasible. These include unlocking new and non-traditional data sources - for instance, unstructured data like text, image, video or audio. These sources can complement and enhance our existing data collections.\n\nAI is also increasingly being incorporated into the economic analyses we carry out to help us prepare our monetary policy decisions.\n\nAI can identify patterns in data more effectively than traditional methods. This is particularly true for non-linearities, which have been playing a bigger role in an environment that is becoming more shock prone. AI also enables the real-time analysis of economic indicators, helping central banks to make more timely policy decisions - a particularly valuable capability in times of crisis.\n\nWhat do these applications look like in practice?\n\nECB staff use AI to nowcast inflation. This includes web-scraping price data and using LLMs for data classification. We are currently exploring the use of Big Data and new generative AI models in close cooperation with the BIS Innovation Hub.\n\nStaff are also applying machine learning models to euro area inflation forecasting, accounting for possible non-linearities. These models are already performing well compared with our conventional forecast and survey-based measures of inflation expectations. Another project is employing machine learning techniques to nowcast global trade.\n\nStaff are also exploring the possibilities opened up by innovative datasets. For instance, projects include using a combination of text data and machine learning techniques to quantify risks and tensions in the global economy and exploring the use of satellite data to track economic activity.\n\nCentral bank communication is another area in which AI can contribute.\n\nAI could help in areas where central bank communication is key, such as ensuring that policy decisions are well understood and keeping inflation expectations anchored. With AI, we can rapidly analyse vast volumes of media reporting and market commentary.\n\nMoreover, AI can help us communicate with the public in all parts of the euro area. As a European institution, the ECB communicates in all 24 official languages of the EU. Even today, AI and machine translation are helping us meet a demand for translation that exceeds 6 million pages per year. Without those tools, the ECB's language services would be limited to covering around 150,000 pages per year.\n\nAI can also help broaden our reach by simplifying key messages and communication products for targeted audiences that have less awareness or knowledge of the ECB. And it could help us answer any questions the public may have.\n\nAll these innovations could ultimately make the ECB better understood, facilitate the effectiveness of our monetary policy and boost our accountability.\n\nAI might also bring profound changes to the field of market infrastructures and payments.\n\nThe technology could help design and develop innovative payments services customised to consumers' needs and preferences. And it could help foster financial inclusion, for example, by facilitating voice activated payments. These potential developments are clearly relevant when it comes to the ECB's role in promoting efficient, integrated and inclusive payments.\n\nMoreover, AI could also help us oversee payment systems. There is an opportunity to use AI as part of early warning models that aim to identify financial stability risks related to financial market infrastructures before these risks materialise. And it could play a supporting role in the scrutiny of information provided by overseen entities, helping us ensure that their practices align with the applicable regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe ECB has developed an AI action plan to facilitate the adoption of AI wherever it is relevant to our tasks. It aims to develop and deploy the necessary AI tools and infrastructure, while fostering AI skills and ensuring the technology is used safely and responsibly.\n\nLet me now turn to the limits of AI.\n\nA key strength of human intelligence is the ability to reflect on its limits. As the philosopher Immanuel Kant once wrote, \"we can cognize of things a priori only what we ourselves have put into them\". But AI does not have this capacity for self-reflection. Nor does it have the ability to produce its own safeguards independently of human critical thinking. We therefore need to be aware of the limits of AI and their implications for the ECB, so that we can put the necessary guardrails in place.\n\nFirst, we need to ensure confidentiality and privacy.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of central banks' decisions, guaranteeing confidentiality is a key condition for the in-house use of AI. Likewise, when it comes to data use, AI will increase concerns about privacy, underlining the importance of applying technological and governance safeguards and complying with regulations such as the EU AI Act.\n\nTake, for instance, the AI solutions we use for our statistics. These tools need to provide comprehensive documentation. This is a prerequisite for clarifying how AI solutions have been used to assess, improve or integrate data. Trust in these solutions comes from first understanding them.\n\nThe second risk stemming from AI is the degree to which it can be used to spread false information and data, facilitate fraud or launch cyberattacks.\n\nSince late 2022 there has been a 53-fold increase in generative AI-related incidents and hazards reported in the media. It is one thing for an AI-generated deepfake video of Tom Cruise to go viral. But it is quite another when a deepfake of a policymaker goes viral - particularly at moments of crisis, when attention levels are high and volatility and uncertainty are already pronounced.\n\nAt the same time, AI can be used to detect and address such risks. It can help prevent and detect cyberattacks by identifying anomalies in user, system and network behaviours in real time.\n\nThe third risk emerges from what we might describe as an over-arching dependence on AI. And this can manifest itself in several ways.\n\nFor instance, a greater dependence on AI may inadvertently increase the risk of falling into an \"echo chamber\" trap.\n\nGiven that LLMs are trained using available data and information - which, over time, will increasingly be produced by AI - there is a risk of AI becoming self-referential or repeating existing biases.\n\nTo the extent that this dynamic increases the impact of central bank communication on markets, while central banks look to the markets for information, it could increase the risk of central bank echo chambers emerging. This could, for instance, increase the risks of using forward guidance.\n\nAn excessive reliance on AI could also reduce our own operational resilience.\n\nAs AI becomes a bigger part of our way of working, we may find ourselves growing more dependent on it for core tasks. That is why it is so important to understand the properties of the AI algorithms and models we use to reduce the risks of a potential \"black box\" effect.\n\nSimilarly, if it is not used responsibly, AI could also suppress the diversity and originality of thought, thereby increasing the risk of groupthink and confirmation bias. The mathematician Alan Turing once famously asked, \"Can machines think?\" The last thing we want is for the same question to be asked about central bankers who end up being too reliant on AI.\n\nA key feature of human cognition is the ability to question existing theories, produce new ones and identify data to test them. This ability needs to be preserved. ECB Governing Council meetings are best understood as a process of comparing views on the economy, considering alternative interpretations of economic developments and assessing risks from multiple perspectives. The ongoing uncertainty in the economy shows that we need to do this more, rather than less.\n\nThe overall lesson is that humans need to remain firmly in control, not only to ensure a trustworthy use of AI systems, but also to address questions of accountability and maintain the public's trust in the central bank.\n\nTo conclude, as we enter the AI age, we face the challenge of realising its potential while managing its risks.\n\nWhether AI will show up in productivity statistics or create a new paradox remains uncertain. To an extent, whether we face an AI productivity paradox will partly depend on our ability to accurately measure its contribution - and statisticians have an important role to play given the complexity of measuring intangible capital.\n\nBut as with other technologies, for AI to be able to produce its full effects, the right ecosystem must be in place - one that facilitates competition in the AI sphere, ensures a fair distribution of possible productivity gains, establishes robust regulatory and ethical safeguards and fosters the corresponding skills in the labour market.\n\nFor central banks, AI offers opportunities for innovation and efficiency gains, from economic analysis to communication. But there are also risks that must be considered, and we are duly building appropriate safeguards.\n\nAs we integrate AI into our processes, we must ensure that human judgement and critical thinking remain at the forefront. This balance will be essential to maintaining trust in our data, our decisions and the broader financial system.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

Li noted that China has always actively embraced the intelligent revolution, vigorously promoted the innovation and development of AI, attached great importance to the security and governance of AI, and implemented a series of practical measures.\n\nHaving been held annually for six times, this year's WAIC focuses on the theme \"Governing AI for Good and for All,\" with aims to establish international cooperation and exchange platforms featuring openness, inclusiveness, and equal participation, advance global AI governance, and develop an open, fair and effective governance mechanism.\n\nIndustry insiders and experts noted that Premier Li's remarks further demonstrated China's role as a great power, and China's significant achievements in the AI development and its firm determination of opening-up will provide more efficient plans to the global AI governance, as well as inject more growth momentum into the sound, safe and orderly development of AI.\n\nChina launched the Global AI Governance Initiative and proposed a resolution at the 78th UN General Assembly to enhance international cooperation on AI capacity building, which was unanimously adopted. China has made positive explorations and contributed constructive ideas and solutions to the global development and governance of AI, said Li.\n\nLi said China is ready to work with other countries to make the AI better serve global development and enhance human well-being.\n\nHe put forward three suggestions - to deepen innovation cooperation and unleash the dividend of intelligence; to promote inclusive development and bridge the digital divide; and to strengthen collaborative governance and ensure the benevolence of intelligence.\n\n\"Premier Li's statement reflects a deep understanding and vision of the global development of AI. As Li recognized the importance and potential of the AI technology, as well as its uneven development globally, he called for a 'fair and open' environment to promote the balanced development of AI globally, so that more countries can have the opportunity to benefit from this emerging technology,\" Wang Peng, an associate research fellow at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, told the Chinese on Thursday.\n\nWang noted that as a country with significant influence in the field of AI, China has demonstrated a strong sense of international responsibility and commitment in promoting the sound development of the AI industry. Li's remarks once again demonstrated China's willingness to work with all countries to address the challenges and embrace the opportunities brought about by AI, said Wang.\n\n\"International cooperation is key to ensuring that AI benefits all regions and sectors equally, so we look forward to joining international voices at this event to share information and innovations that can improve global collaboration,\" Seizo Onoe, director of the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau at the International Telecommunication Union, told media on Thursday at the conference.\n\nThis year's conference, being held from Thursday to Saturday, continues to expand when compared with previous editions, with the exhibition scale, and the number of exhibitors and new products reaching the highest in history.\n\nThe conference focuses on key areas such as large language models, arithmetic, robotics, and automatic driving, showcasing a number of the latest achievements in \"AI+\" innovation and application.\n\nMore than 500 companies, including Tesla and Microsoft, have participated in the exhibition, with the number of exhibits exceeding 1,500.\n\nChinese leading AI companies and innovation centers are gearing up for their showcase in this big stage. Qinglong, the world's first full-size general-purpose humanoid robot independently researched and developed by China, made its debut at the WAIC. With a height of 185 centimeters and a weight of 82 kilograms, the humanoid robot has a highly bionic torso configuration and anthropomorphic motion control.\n\nMoreover, a number of Chinese tech companies including SenseTime, iFlytek and Kingsoft Office debuted their large language models or applications.\n\n\"China has a lot of excellent AI companies and research institutions, which have made important breakthroughs in areas such as deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. These technological achievements have not only provided strong support for China's development, but also made important contributions to the advancement of global AI technology,\" Wang noted.\n\n\"I am optimistic about the whole AI outlook in China, because only in China can the technology iteration be so rapid with abundant application scenarios,\" a visitor surnamed Tan told the Global Times at the conference.\n\nTesla on Thursday also showcased its cybertruck and a model of humanoid robot Optimus Gen2 at the WAIC, drawing a large audience. This marks the first time that the robot is showcased in China.\n\nAslan Tarik, chief technology officer of Beijing Tangta Technology Co, said China is a pioneer in the use of new technologies, and is more open and progressive, which also accelerates further development.\n\n\"As a pioneer, China can take the lead, show how to use it to help people, make it available to everyone, no matter whether it is in a big city or in the countryside, and serve as an example for other countries and make this solution available to other countries as well,\" Tarik told media.", "source": {"uri":

That's unsurprising, given that generative AI will likely be the most important technology advancement this decade. However, despite this sentiment and ambition, actual production deployments of AI have only grown by two to five percent in recent years.\n\nPart of the problem is that organizations don't always know how to optimize AI to work for IT. To get the most out of AI, you must ensure it's designed for your use cases. So where do you start?\n\nAI That Speaks IT\n\n\"AI that speaks IT\" lets you quickly extract actionable insights from IT data to achieve your goals.\n\nWhether you want to reduce the number of help desk tickets, make it easier for end users to find answers themselves, or increase productivity on mobile devices, AI is a proven tool that can identify key trends and highlight correlations -- if it has the right features.\n\nAI tools purpose-built for IT typically include specific IT-focused functionality, such as virtual assistants for help desk technicians, natural language queries based on common IT tasks, and predictive analytics for anomaly detection across devices.\n\nHigh-Quality Data: The Foundation of AI\n\nTo get the most ROI from your AI, it needs to be trained on data from your IT endpoints. But you must be intentional about the data to achieve adoption and solve complex enterprise IT challenges.\n\nAs our CEO shared, \"The value of unique large language models and generative AI integrations for enterprises has everything to do with data. The better the data, the better the results are for customized enterprise applications.\"\n\nCollect data from all devices and endpoints to get a complete picture of your organization. Fuel your model with real-time data from various systems, people, apps, and other sources.\n\nDepth\n\nIt's important to train your AI on the most relevant domain-specific data. For example, if you're building an AI to support your help desk, gathering more data from tickets, technician chat logs, support-related emails, devices, and networks will give you more accurate results than simply feeding it generic company-wide data.\n\nHistory\n\nHistorical data is crucial for identifying trends, providing additional context, and building trust with users throughout your organization; we typically recommend using at least three years' worth of data.\n\nQuality\n\nWell-structured, labeled data reduces costs, saves time, and prevents issues from training AI on poor-quality data.\n\nUltimately, your goal is to build employees' trust. As one white paper stated, \"Without good data to feed into the AI, trust can never be achieved. Without trust, full adoption can't happen. And without full adoption, the overall goals can't be achieved.\"\n\nLet Your IT Teams Do More\n\nAI built for IT enhances employee experience, saves time, optimizes budgets, and reallocates resources to core business initiatives.\n\nOne study found that data insights and automation could reduce help desk tickets by 25 percent and MTTR by 50 percent, saving an organization millions of dollars in the process.\n\nFocus on how generative AI can transform the IT experience as its power becomes widely recognized. By fueling your purpose-built AI with high-quality IT data, you can maximize uptime with predictive analytics, give employees more access to answers with natural language queries, and use new insights to fix the right things throughout your organization.", "source": {"uri": "iotforall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IoT For All"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Help desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End user"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anomaly detection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.iotforall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Is-Your-AI-Built-for-IT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

However, this expertise has failed to translate into real-world applications, says Fritzi K\u00f6hler-Geib, the chief economist at the Frankfurt-based bank.\n\n\"With AI, as with many other areas of technology, we struggle to translate research into products that can be used by businesses,\" he told state-owned broadcaster DW.\n\nGermany is not alone in its struggle to keep up with AI advances. Other European countries haven't fared much better, with the U.K.'s AI skills proficiency ranked a distant 45th globally. The U.K. also lags behind France and Germany in AI investment.\n\nFrance has been a brighter spot, with some startups, such as Paris-based Mistral AI, raising $645 million at a $6 billion valuation last month. French AI startups have raised over $2.3 billion, the most in Europe.\n\nStill, European nations have lost out to Asia and North America in AI. Data from KfW shows that the US and China collectively control over half of all global AI patents. Germany is a distant fifth, ranking behind South Korea and Japan as well.\n\nFor Germany, its sluggish progress in AI development leaves its people at the mercy of companies based in other regions. With China and the U.S. seemingly ready to keep investing in the technology for years, Germany, and Europe in general, could lose out yet again on the opportunity to be technologically self-sufficient.\n\nIt could get worse for Germany, says Alexander L\u00f6ser, a data science professor at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences and Technology. He pointed out that Germany is increasingly losing its best talent to Silicon Valley and other global AI hotspots, which could spell doom for the country's ambitions down the road.\n\n\"Many universities here do excellent research and train highly qualified people, but a significant number of them then choose to work abroad,\" he said.\n\nThe EU's stringent data laws add to the problem, L\u00f6ser noted. It's much costlier to acquire training data in the EU, which is the lifeblood of AI development. The recent clash between Meta (NASDAQ: META) and EU regulators over its attempt to use Facebook and Instagram data to train its AI is the latest demonstration of the region's strict data laws.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Indians have been slow to adopt the AI chatbot for their use cases but a new report suggests ChatGPT is now part of more than 90 percent Indian offices who are relying on the AI chatbot for their work.\n\nWe continue to hear how India Inc is ready to invest billions into bringing AI tools to its operations and the latest data provided by DeskTime seems to hint that the workforce is more than equipped to tackle the transition to AI tools.\n\nThe ticket size of the time tracking done by the platform includes 297 companies with over 14000 employees. So, you could say the proportion of people using AI tools like ChatGPT has steadily gone up, giving companies more reason to upskill and upgrade their workforce.\n\nThe data collected from these companies range from January 2023 to March 2024. ChatGPT was introduced in late 2022 so the pace of adoption seems quite good, with many more expected to lap up ChatGPT and other AI tools to optimise their work and do it efficiently.\n\nDeskTime also claims that Indians are leading the way for adopting AI tools for their productivity but this is just the start for the transition that brings its own challenges.\n\nThe same report highlights that as of March 2024, more than 40 percent of the Indian workforce is using ChatGPT actively without sharing details about what is their prime use case. The AI chatbot offers a gamut of features, from basic queries to complex prompts. People who are getting left behind will need to upgrade their skills and train in these tools so that more companies find available workforce ready to be part of the AI shift.\n\nTech giants like Google and Meta have already shown the way by laying off employees and replacing them with AI but there is still a large part of the industry that can co-exist with the advancement of AI in the years to come.\n\nIt is fascinating to see AI become a core part of people's work setup but we still wait for the hardware to match up to these advanced AI models. Intel, Apple and Qualcomm are doing their bit for the AI PC evolution while Google, Apple and Meta build mobile use cases for AI on the pocket-friendly hardware.\n\nApple is also tying up with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to macOS, and iPhones.

In this episode, our labor and employment lawyers, Mark Goldstein and Carl de Cicco, discuss what employers need to know about the use of AI in the workplace and the key differences between and implications for the UK and the United States.\n\nTranscript:\n\nIntro: Hello, and welcome to Tech Law Talks, a podcast brought to you by Reed Smith's Emerging Technologies group. In each episode of this podcast, we will discuss cutting edge issues on technology, data, and the law. We will provide practical observations on a wide variety of technology and data topics to give you quick and actionable tips to address the issues you are dealing with every day.\n\nMark: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Tech Law Talks podcast. We're starting a new series on artificial intelligence or AI, where the coming months we'll explore the key challenges and opportunities within the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Today, we will focus on AI in the U.S. and U.K. workplaces. My name is Mark Goldstein. I'm a partner in Reed Smith's Labor and Employment Group, resident in our New York office. And I'm here joined today by my colleague, Carl De Cicco from our London office. And we're going to talk today about some of the U.S. and U.K. Implications for AI as it relates to the workplace. So, Carl, let me kick it over to you. And if you can tell us, you know, from a high level, what do employers in the UK need to know when it comes to AI related issues in the workplace?\n\nCarl: Thank you, Mark. So, yes, my name is Carl. I'm a partner here in the London Employment Group of Reed Smith. And essentially, I think the AI issues to be concerned about in the UK are twofold. The first is how it pertains to day to day activities. And the second is how it relates to kind of management side of things. So look on the type of day-to-day activities point that's hopefully the things that people are starting to see themselves in their own workplace starting to come in so use of particular generative AI programs or models to help generate content and that's obviously increasing the amount of output individuals can have and so on the one hand it's quite good on the other hand thinking about it there might be some issues to look at so for example are people being overly reliant on their AI are they simply putting the request in and whatever is churned out by the AI system is that being submitted as the work product and if so that could be quite concerning because, AI is obviously a very useful tool and is sure to continue improving as time goes on but where we stand right now AI is far from perfect and you can get what are known as hallucinations and this seems to be quite a nice term of art for effectively what are errors so things that are conclusions that are drawn on the basis of information that doesn't exist, or quotations of things that do not exist either. So really, the content that's produced by AI should be seen as something that's collaborative with the worker that's involved in the matter rather than something which AI should be totally responsible for. So see it as a first pass rather than the finished product. You should be checking the product that comes out, not just the things like making sure that sources stack up and the conclusions draw back to the data underneath, but to make sure also that you're not getting to a stage where there might be plagiarization. So AI takes what is available on the internet and that can lead to circumstances where actually somebody somebody's very good work is already out there is simply being reproduced if not word for word substantially that can obviously lead to issues not just for the person who's submitting the work but for the employer who might use that particular piece of generated work for something that they're doing. Other benefits could be things like work allocation so one of the issues that people look at in the DEI space is our opportunities for work being fairly and equally distributed, people getting enough of a looking at work, both in terms of amount and quality. And obviously, if you have a programme which is blind to who the work is going to, there's potential for that work to be more fairly distributed so that those who don't often get the opportunity to work on particular matters are actually finding themselves onto the kind of work they weren't previously dealing with and they would like to be able to get and experience of. Now, that's the positive side of it. The potential negative there is that there might be some bias in the AI that underpins that resourcing program. So, for example, it might not pick all the individuals who are less occupied than others in a way which a business might have in a view to what's coming up over the next week or two. It might not even pick up quite how the quality of work should be viewed through all particular lenses. It might have a particular skew on how quality of work is viewed. And that could lead perhaps to an individual being even more pigeonholed than before. So all of these things are potentially positive but need to be underpinned by essentially a second human checker so whilst there are many many positives it shouldn't be seen as a panacea. So well how's that holding up for what you're seeing in the states particularly new york?\n\nMark: I think that that's absolutely right Carl similar principles apply here in the US i think it's by way of background to go through kind of where I've seen AI kind of infiltrate the workplace, if you will. And I'll distinguish between AI, traditional AI, and then generative AI. So I've seen, you know, we've seen AI be used by employers in the U.S. and a whole host of fronts from headhunting, screening job applicants, running background checks, inducting job interviews coming up with a slate of questions. Also to things like performance management for employees and even selection criteria and deciding which employees to select for a reduction in force or mass layoff. I've also seen employers use AI in the context of simple administrative tasks like guiding employees to policy documents or benefits materials and then creating employee and workplace-related agreements and implementing document retention and creation policies and protocols. In terms of generative AI, which is more, as you noted, on the content creation front, I've certainly seen that by employees being used to translate messages or documents. And to perform certain other tasks, including creating responses from manager inquiries to more substantive documents. But as you rightly note, just as in the UK, there are a number of potential pitfalls in the US. The first is that there's a risk, as you noted, of AI plagiarizing or using a third party's intellectual property, especially if the generative AI is going to be used in a document that's going to be outward facing or external, you run substantial risk. So absolutely review and auditing any materials that are created by generative AI, among other things, to ensure that there's no plagiarism or copying, especially when, again, that material is going externally, is incredibly important. Simply reviewing the content as well, just beyond plagiarism, simply to ensure general accuracy. There was a story out of, you know, New York Federal Court last summer about an attorney who had ChatGPT help write a legal brief and asked ChatGPT to, you know, run some legal research and find some cases. And ultimately, the case sites that were provided were fictional, were not actual cases that had truly been decided. So a good reminder that, as Carl said, while generative AI can be useful, it is not, you know, an absolute panacea and needs to be reviewed and conducted, you know, reviewed thoroughly. And then, you know, similarly, you run a risk if employees are using certain generative AI platforms that the employee may be disclosing confidential company information or intellectual property on that third party platform. So we want to make sure that, you know, even when generative AI is used, that employees are doing so within the appropriate confines of company policy and their agreements, of course, things like confidential information and trade secrets and intellectual property. You know, so I think it's important that employers, you know, look to adopt some sort of AI and generative AI policy so that employees know what the expectations are in terms of, you know, what they can and equally, if not more importantly, what they cannot do in the workplace as it relates to AI and generative AI. And certainly we've been helping our clients put together those sorts of policies so employees can understand the expectations. Carl you know we talked we've talked so far kind of generally about you know implications for the workplace is there any specific legislation or regulations from the UK side of things that you all have been monitoring or that have come out?\n\nCarl: The approach of the UK government to date has been to not legislate in this area in a in what I think is an attempt to achieve a balance between regulation and growth the plan I think so far has been to to at some point introduce a voluntary self-regulatory scheme, which bodies sign up to. But we're recording this in June 2024, less than one month away from a UK general election. So matters of AI regulation and legislation are currently on the back burner, not to be revived perhaps for at least another two to three months. But what we can, there is still, of course, a lot of interest in this area. And the UK TUC, which is a federation of trade unions in the UK, has published sort of a framework proposal for what the law might look like. This is far from being a legislation and obviously many hurdles to pass before this might even come before Parliament and whether or not if it is passed, put before Parliament, whether it's approved by all there. But this looks at things very similar to what the EU are looking at, that is to the risks-based approach to legislation in this area. And they draw a distinction between regular decision-making and what they call high-risk decision-making. And the high-risk decision-making is really shorthand for decisions which might affect the employment of an individual, whether that's recruitment. Whether it's a decision, disciplinary decisions, termination decision. Essentially all the major employment related decisions are to go through essentially a system of checking so you couldn't rely purely for example in the framework on a decision made purely by AI. It'd be required that an individual sits alongside that or at least only uses the AI tangentially to decision that they're making. Things like no emotion recognition software would be allowed so that's for example if you were to have a disciplinary hearing and that's to be recorded you could use software which is designed to pick up on things like inflection word pattern things that might infer a particular motive or meaning behind what's been said and what this framework proposal does is say that kind of material could have that kind of software or programming couldn't be used in that kind of setting. So what happens in the UK remains to be seen but i think you guys are a bit further ahead than us and actually have some law and statute. How are things working out for you?\n\nMark: We've seen a lot of government agencies, as well as state legislatures, put an emphasis on this issue in terms of potential regulatory guidance or proposed legislation. To date, there has not been a huge amount of legislation passed specifically relating to AI in the workplace. We're still at the phase where most jurisdictions are still considering legislation. That said, there was an extremely broad law passed by New York City a few years ago, which finally went into effect last July. And in a nutshell, we can have an entirely separate podcast just on the nuances of the New York City law. But essentially what the New York City law does is it stops employers or bars employers from using an automated employment decision tool or an AEDT to screen job candidates when making employment decisions unless three criteria have been satisfied. First, the tool has been subjected to an independent bias audit within the year prior to the use. A summary of the most recent bias audit results are posted on the employer's website, and the employer has provided prior written notice regarding use of the AEDT to any job applicants and employees who will be subject to screening by it. If any one or more of these three criteria aren't satisfied, then an employer's use of that AEDT with respect to any employment decisions would violate the New York City Human Rights Law, which is one of the most employee-friendly anti-discrimination statutes in America. And other jurisdictions have used the New York City law as somewhat of a model for potential of the legislation. We've also seen the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the EEOC weigh in and issue some guidance, though not binding necessarily strongly cautions employers with regards to the use of AI and the potential for disparate impact on certain protected classes of job applicants and employees, and generally cautioning and recommending that employers conduct periodic audits of their tools to ensure no bias occurs. Carl, do you have any final thoughts?\n\nCarl: So whilst we're still a long way from legislation in the UK, there are things employers can be thinking about and doing now to prepare themselves for I think what will inevitably be coming down the road. So just a few suggestions on that front. Establish an AI committee. So take ownership of how AI is used in the business, whether that's in the performance of day-to-day tasks and content generation and such. As Mark said earlier on, setting up things like what can be done what checks should be carried out ensuring that there is a level of quality control and also in terms of decision making ensuring that there is a policy that employers can look to to make sure that they are not going to one fall foul of something in the act and also have something so that if any decisions are challenged in future not just can they look back on the measures they've taken but show that it's consistent with a policy that they've adopted and applied on an equal basis for all individuals going through any particular process may give rise to complaints. And they might also, for example, conduct a risk assessment and audit of their systems. I mean, one of the things that will be key is not just saying that I had AI and that was used in a particular process, but knowing how that AI actually worked and how it filtered or made decisions that it did. So, for example, if you want to be able to guard against an allegation of bias, it would be good to have a good understanding of how the AI system in question that gave rise to decision that's in dispute had made its determination as over one individual than the other that will help the employer to be able to demonstrate first of all that they are an equal opportunities employer in the event of real challenge the discrimination didn't occur, so look those kind of things are things employers can be thinking about and doing. Now what kind of things do you think people on your side of the pond might be thinking about?\n\nMark: Yeah so I think you know similar similar considerations for U.S. employers. I think among them, considering the pros and cons, if you're going to use an AI tool, building your own, which some employers have opted for versus purchasing from a third party. If purchasing from a third party, particularly given the EEOC and other agencies' stated interest in scrutinizing how tools potentially might create some sort of discriminatory impact, consider including an indemnification provision in any contracts that you're negotiating. And in jurisdictions like New York City, where you're required to conduct an annual audit, but even outside New York City, especially given that it's been recommended by the EEOC, consider periodic auditing of any employee and company AI use to ensure, for instance, that tools aren't skewing a paper of or against a particular protected class during the hiring process. And again, I strongly recommend developing and adopting some sort of workplace AI and generative AI policy. Thank you all for your time today. We greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Carl.

And some U.S. states have launched specialized programs to train workers on how to deal with the new technologies.\n\nMany industries are expected to heavily depend on a series of tools known as generative AI. This technology includes systems designed to perform many jobs currently done by humans. Such systems have become increasingly smarter in recent years.\n\nIn Connecticut, officials have been working to create what they hope will be the country's first Citizens AI Academy. This will be a free, online collection of special classes designed to teach basic AI skills and provide certifications needed for employment.\n\nConnecticut Democratic Senator James Maroney told the Associated Press that AI changes in the workplace are happening very quickly. \"So we need to all learn what are the best sources for staying current,\" he said. \"How can we update our skills? Who can be trusted sources?\"\n\nGregory LaBlanc is a professor of Finance, Strategy and Law at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley Law School in California. He says workers should be taught how to use and manage generative AI.\n\nLaBlanc said he thinks it makes more sense to center on teaching ways to support AI \"as opposed to learning to be really bad imitators of AI.\" He added that employees should be trained in areas where AI does not perform well so that workers can make up the difference.\n\nThis year, at least four states proposed legislation that sought ways to deal with AI in the classroom. Those states included Connecticut, California, Mississippi and Maryland.\n\nOne bill in California would require a state working group to consider including AI literacy skills in math, science, history and social science studies.\n\nThe writer of the bill is California Assemblyman Marc Berman. He said in a statement that AI offers the possibility to improve parts of our lives. \"But only if we know how to use it, and use it responsibly,\" he added.\n\nBerman noted that all students should be taught about basic AI elements and systems. He said students should also learn \"the skills to recognize when AI is employed...\"\n\nIn Connecticut, Senator Maroney said his state's planned AI Academy will also aim to provide studies on AI basics. He noted the importance for people to have the skills to understand, examine and effectively interact with a range of AI technologies.\n\nA study released by the job-search company Indeed found that all U.S. jobs listed on the service had skills that could be performed or improved by generative AI tools.\n\nNearly 20 percent of the Indeed job listings were considered \"highly exposed.\" This means the technology is considered good or excellent at 80 percent of the skills the jobs require. Nearly 46 percent of jobs on the service were \"moderately exposed.\" This means that AI tools can perform 50 to 80 percent of the skills.\n\nMaroney said he is concerned that AI will worsen existing equity problems related to a lack of high-speed internet, computers and smart phones in some underserved communities. Inequities have been identified between more digitally literate people, often living in cities, and those living in more rural areas without dependable internet and modern devices.\n\nMarvin Venay shares that concern. He is with the Massachusetts-based group Bring Tech Home Advocates. The group has been working for years to narrow differences in computer literacy and high-speed internet availability.\n\nVenay said, \"Education must be included in order for this to really take off publicly...in a manner which is going to give people the ability to eliminate their barriers.\"\n\nVenay added, \"And it has to be able to explain to the most common individual why it is not only a useful tool, but why this tool will be something that can be trusted.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported this story.

Certain copyright-protected works may no longer be available for use in training AI models.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere are three primary aspects of generative AI applications that intersect with copyright protection: (1) machine learning with protected works (the input side); (2) the protectability of works created with the assistance of generative AI (the discussion on copyright protection of AI generated works); and (3) potential infringement by the output of preexisting works (the output side). This GT Alert focuses on legal issues with respect to the input side.\n\nOn the input side, a main concern is whether publicly available, copyright-protected works may be used to train AI models used by commercial companies.\n\nBecause AI is designed to mirror human intellect, the input side of AI may be compared to a person reading a book or listening to music. The process of gaining knowledge or inspiration through reading the book or listening to music is seamless and happens automatically. There are no laws prohibiting the use of the increased knowledge or inspiration for commercial purposes, barring any direct or indirect copying from the respective books or music.\n\nCompared to the organic way that humans gain knowledge, those who train AI models have more control over how and whether AI learns from data fed to it. Another difference between AI and human intelligence is AI's capacity to consume and build on ostensibly unlimited quantities of data. As a result, AI has the potential to accelerate technological processes and innovation exponentially.\n\nConsequently, an emerging question surrounding AI regulation is the extent to which machine learning should be limited in order to respect intellectual property rights.\n\nMachine Learning under the EU AI Act\n\nThe EU AI Act, approved by the EU Council 21 May 2024, takes a first stab at answering this question. The EU AI Act contains a provision that equates AI/machine learning with \"text-and-datamining\" (TDM) under the EU Text and Data Mining Directive.[1] Consequently, \"machine learning\" is allowed, provided that\n\nThe EU AI Act is expected to enter into force in 2024 and will fully apply 24 months thereafter. However, the TDM exception under the EU Text and Data Mining Directive already exists. Therefore, the TDM exception for machine learning can already be enforced in anticipation of the EU AI Act's interpretation.\n\nOpt-Out Mechanism\n\nWhile it is not yet clear how a legally valid opt-out request would be made, various organizations, such as the Dutch collecting society Pictoright (pictures) and the French collecting society Sacem (music), have drafted general reservation of rights statements, allowing creators to opt out of their data being used to train AI models. In addition, many websites and images on social media now include similar opt-out statements.\n\nWhile no case law or other authoritative document exists to determine the sufficiency of such statements to trigger the opt-out criteria, the trend may intensify now that the EU AI Act has been adopted.\n\nTakeaways\n\nAlthough the EU AI Act and its TDM exception have yet to become formally applicable, AI system providers and developers should consider implementing measures and configurations to avoid infringement claims by rightsholders.

But the opposite is apt to be true.\n\nFact: AI will likely create far more jobs than it destroys\n\nA recent study revealed that AI tools like ChatGPT can help bridge skill gaps, enhancing the capabilities of less knowledgeable workers and boosting efficiency for seasoned professionals [1]. Copilot in Windows also frees up valuable employee time by automating administrative tasks, freeing workers to focus on strategic initiatives that drive individual and organizational growth. Ultimately, AI is poised to help people offload lower-value tasks and prioritize more meaningful work.\n\nWhen it comes to leading the AI charge, some leaders are playing hot potato.\n\nFact: Employees rely on leaders for strategic AI implementation\n\nTo effectively leverage AI, employees need more than just access -- they require clear guidance. IT teams must be able to equip workers with the right AI tools and ensure thorough training for optimal use. The right training will cut confusion and frustration.\n\nDespite what you might've heard, integrating AI into workflows doesn't require a complete overhaul of existing IT infrastructure.\n\nFact: Familiar platforms can drive easy and effective AI adoption\n\nThe new HP AI PCs running Windows 11 and the latest Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors make it easy to access cutting-edge tech through an intuitive interface. By allowing teams to tap into new capabilities within a familiar platform, IT can be a hero without a lot of extra effort and stress. Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors featuring NPU engines also mean these HP AI PCs, such as the EliteBook 1000 series, can extend battery life, boost productivity, and enhance collaboration, packing a powerful punch of added benefits.\n\nWhile AI-enabled threats and on-device AI activity are turning endpoints into prime targets, that doesn't mean AI PCs will be less secure than traditional PCs.\n\nFact: AI PCs fortified with hardware enforced protections can instantly block fast-evolving threats\n\nZero-trust hardware can stop sophisticated AI and non-AI threats in their tracks. By choosing HP AI PCs with embedded security at the chip level, IT teams can cut out one major concern and even future-proof devices against advanced quantum computing attacks.\n\nWaiting to implement AI could be a costly mistake. From accelerating innovation to empowering the workforce to reclaim time, AI is quickly becoming a game-changer for employees and companies of every size across industries.\n\nFact: The right tech providers can help you capitalize on AI\n\nTrusted tech providers can partner with you to deliver clarity and assistance. They can create a tailored roadmap to help everyone in your business make the most of AI -- from top management to remote workers.

{"uri": "8208384480", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-03", "time": "19:31:13", "dateTime": "2024-07-03T19:31:13Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-03T19:30:38Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "url": "https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240703/fundamentals/the-rise-of-telco-ai-is-very-much-an-exercise-in-ecosystem-collaboration", "title": "How to get telco AI right -- it takes an (even bigger) ecosystem", "body": "From devices to on-prem to the public cloud, getting telco AI right involves bringing more new players into an already rapidly expanding ecosystem\n\nIt's still early days for advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI (gen AI) with the telecoms set, but the big idea is that customer-facing and internal automation, enabled by AI, could (hopefully) fundamentally change the value proposition operators can put into the market. And that's market in the sense that new products and services would help expand addressable market specifically within the enterprise space, and potentially convince financial markets that AI-powered operators are a going concern rather than a safe dividend with flat growth prospects. But before any of that happens, a lot of other things need to happen and, given the scale and complexity, doing those things will require an even bigger ecosystem than already services the sector.\n\nThe rise of gen AI comes at a time when communications service providers were already going through major technological and operating model overhauls. The transition to multi-cloud network operations environments, and the reskilling needed to manage the new pace of change that cloud necessitates, and the move towards hardware/software disaggregation in the radio access network (RAN) were already heavy lifts. And now AI.\n\nSome key trend lines that speak to the expanding ecosystem operators need around them to get AI right came up during the recent Telco AI Forum, available on demand here. Standouts were the changing nature of customer interaction, the organizational changes needed for humans to work effectively alongside AI-enabled solutions to boost productivity, on-device AI setting the stage for a sort of hybrid processing paradigm, a potential network re-architecture that considers where compute is (or needs to be) in order to support AI use cases and, underlying it all, the people and skills needed to make it all work.\n\nBlue Planet Vice President of Products, Alliances and Architectures Gabriele Di Piazza, formerly of Google Cloud and VMware, rightly called out that new players are becoming increasingly relevant to telecoms-the hyperscalers with the money to stand up GPU clusters at global scale and the companies that develop large language models (LLMs), for instance. There will need to be a good bit of ecosystem-level dialogue to \"try to understand what can be done to tune an LLM specific for the telco industry,\" he said. And he likened the necessary shift in operating model to the advent of DevOps alongside cloud-native-which is very much still a work in progress for operators. \"I think the same dynamic is at play right now in terms of management of AI, in terms of supervision, operations, and so I think it will be a big skills transformation happening as well.\"\n\nLooking more narrowly at the radio access network (RAN), Keysight Technologies' Balaji Raghothaman said gen AI for customer care type applications is fairly well established but, \"When it comes to the network itself, it's very much a work in progress.\" AI can improve processes like network planning, traffic shaping, mobility management, etc... \"But I think the challenge and focus for me is really on energy efficiency because, as we blow up our capacity expectations, we are having to add...more and more antennas to our radios and then blast at higher power.\"\n\nThe radio, he said, is the \"ultimate bottleneck\" in the network and requires the majority of compute and the energy needed for that compute. \"The radio is where the action is. There are laws of physics-types of limits that have to be conquered and AI can play an important role.\" From an ecosystem perspective, Raghothaman said early attempts leaned toward the proprietary, black box end of the spectrum whereas the movement now is towards collaborative, multi-vendor implementations and emerging standardization.\n\n\"This is really opening up the space,\" he said, \"but also leading into new and interesting areas of how different vendors collaborate and exchange models, but still keep their innovative edge to themselves. This is going to be the emerging big area of...struggle as we accept AI into this wireless network space.\"\n\nExpanding from the network out to the actual end user, KORE Wireless Vice President of Engineering Jorrit Kronjee looked at the rise of powerful chipsets that can run multi-billion parameters LLMs on-device, meaning no edge or central cloud is needed to deliver an AI-enabled outcome to a user. Thinking about that opportunity, he said, \"I think when we really start re-imagining what will it look like with AI, we may come up with a whole new suite of products that can really benefit the customer in terms of reliability and always-on...Next to that, I think there are more and more devices that are coming into the market that can run AI models locally...which will open up a whole new set of use cases for customers.\"\n\nBack to the earlier conversation around where compute should go in a network based on the need to run various AI workloads, Kronjee said, \"We can now start running AI at the edge,\" meaning the far, far edge-the device. \"You can have these models make decisions locally which would reduce your latency, so you can make much quicker decisions compared to having an AI model run in the cloud somewhere.\" Another big piece here is the transport cost (or lack thereof) associated with a roundtrip from a device to run an AI workload vs. running that workload right there on the device.\n\nMore on the architectural point, Di Piazza said, \"If you start thinking both of moving AI to the edge or even the data center, I think this actually starts to change the compute architecture that has existed for the last 30 years.\" With CPU-centric approaches given way to more distributed offloading and acceleration, \"I think we'll see a major change in the next maybe two to five years.\" But, he said, \"Not necessarily everything means changing the location of compute. In fact, it's important to understand the application profile to be delivered.\" He noted that while AR/VR could well be served from central data centers and still meet latency requirements, another maybe sleeper consideration is data residency requirements. Regardless, \"Compute will be much more distributed.\"\n\nThinking beyond 5G and onto 6G, Raghothaman highlighted the opportunity around AI-enabled network digital twins. He said a country-scale digital twin of a network would be a \"vital\" tool for experimentation. The digital replica \"where they can run simulations of new scenarios overnight or in a day where that would have literally taken a year to run in the past...I think is going to be very interesting.\"\n\nFrom the operator perspective, Antonietta Mastroianna, chief digital and IT officer for Belgian service provider Proximus, focused her comments on how the move from \"isolated use cases\" using AI to broad deployment is \"an essential shift\" that \"is changing completely the organizing model...We have moved from improvements here and there into completely revolutionizing the operating model, the skills of the people, the landscape not only in terms of technologies but also...how the organization is designed. It's unbelievable the shift that is happening...The opportunity is immense.\"", "source": {"uri": "rcrwireless.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RCR Wireless News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_kinney@rcrwireless.com", "name": "Sean Kinney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_access_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radio access network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telephone company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-premises software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keysight", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keysight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_shaping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic shaping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VMware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KORE_Wireless", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KORE Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots_and_Honeynets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Honeypots and Honeynets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/71140939_l_normal_none-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

We've gathered insights from Founders and Chief Technology Officers on the critical metrics that define AI's ROI. From assessing AI's impact on specific KPIs to examining cost reduction through AI implementation, explore how these startups measure AI investment success.\n\nAssess AI Impact on Specific KPIs Track Key Metrics Pre- and Post-AI Evaluate Financial and Non-Financial Indicators Measure AI's Impact on Core Goals Calculate Time Savings from AI Analyze Real-World AI Usage and Impact Assess AI-Driven Human Capital Cost Savings Focus on Cost Savings and Customer Satisfaction Analyze AI's Impact on Efficiency and Revenue Monitor AI's Contribution to Business Goals Combine Intuition with Solid Data Track AI's Influence on Operations and Experience Capture Productivity Gains and Cost Reductions Gauge Financial Impact with Cost-Benefit Ratio Examine Cost Reduction Through AI Implementation\n\nAssess AI Impact on Specific KPIs\n\nFor startups, measuring AI ROI is a multifaceted challenge. While traditional metrics like cost reduction and revenue growth are important, they often don't capture the full picture.\n\nWe focus on assessing the impact of AI on key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to our business goals. This might include customer engagement, operational efficiency, or the speed and accuracy of decision-making.\n\nIn addition, we track softer metrics like employee satisfaction and the pace of innovation, as these can be strong indicators of long-term value generated by AI investments.\n\nSylvester Kaczmarek, Chief Technology Officer, OrbiSky Systems\n\nTrack Key Metrics Pre- and Post-AI\n\nAt Zibtek, we measure the ROI of our AI initiatives by focusing on several key metrics. We assess cost savings by comparing operational expenses pre- and post-implementation. Revenue growth is tracked to see the direct impact of AI on sales. Efficiency gains and productivity improvements are monitored through process metrics, while customer satisfaction is measured using Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and customer feedback. Additionally, time savings from task automation are evaluated. Regular reviews and analytics tools help us ensure alignment with business goals and maximize returns.\n\nCache Merrill, Founder, Zibtek\n\nEvaluate Financial and Non-Financial Indicators\n\nI would highlight three key metrics for assessing a startup's ROI on AI initiatives:\n\nDirect financial indicators that are the easiest to track:\n\nThe main investment component here is the direct cost of developing and implementing AI solutions: employee payroll, outsourcing, consulting, licenses, royalties, and so on. The revenue part can be derived not only from selling AI-powered technologies and solutions to your customers but also from reducing costs by implementing AI initiatives (e.g., process automation, employee efficiency growth, team optimization, etc.).\n\nNon-financial indicators that significantly impact the overall performance of the company:\n\nThese can include increased productivity and task completion speed, improved product and service quality, increased customer satisfaction, and higher competitiveness overall. These metrics can be tracked through customer surveys and perception studies.\n\nTime factors:\n\nHere we assess the timeline for the ROI on AI investments, taking into account the speed of implementation and when we can get the first results, as well as the long-term perspectives for these particular AI technologies in the business.\n\nWhen developing a comprehensive AI strategy for a startup, it is important to consider all these factors together. For example, a certain business-critical technology may cost $2 million on the market, and you can buy it right now, or you can spend two years on in-house development, and it will cost you only $1 million. In this case, we cannot just evaluate direct financial indicators and consider the in-house solution saves us 50%, as we also lose two years when the company operates at a lower efficiency.\n\nWe are an AI company selling technology as a service. In our case, investments in AI initiatives aren't just nice to have -- they are our actual business. Such a holistic approach allows me, as Lemon AI's CEO, to make better-weighted decisions on AI investments, evaluate their effectiveness from a 360-degree perspective, and continuously improve our AI strategy.\n\nAndrew Bluemental, CEO & Co-Founder, Lemon AI\n\nMeasure AI's Impact on Core Goals\n\nAI is undoubtedly a powerful tool, but you must track the right things to see if it's paying off. We focus on two key areas: impact on core business goals and efficiency gains.\n\nFor core goals, this might be increased sales from AI-powered recommendations or improved lead quality. On efficiency, we track things like reduced workload for staff thanks to automation or faster content creation with AI tools.\n\nBy comparing these improvements to the investment in AI software, data management, and training, we get a clear picture of ROI.\n\nRahul Vij, Co Founder, WebSpero Solutions\n\nCalculate Time Savings from AI\n\nI adopted AI to tackle labor-intensive, low-level tasks to free up my team's capacity to handle high-level work that needs a human eye. The goal was to streamline my current operation and simultaneously prepare to scale. Essentially, we're relying on AI to do the donkey work. For me, the key metric I'm looking for is hours saved. By applying an average time per task or run, I can estimate the cost to my business of manually doing that task or run. I'd recommend understanding the time savings and weighing them against the cost of the AI initiative before diving in.\n\nRonald Osborne, Founder, Ronald Osborne Business Consultancy and Coaching\n\nAnalyze Real-World AI Usage and Impact\n\nMeasuring the return on investment (ROI) of our AI initiatives is crucial to ensure we're delivering value to our customers and their K-9 companions. We rely on metrics that reflect real-world usage and impact.\n\nFor instance, we track how frequently our AI features are used through Mixpanel events. By analyzing this data, we can see which features our customers find most valuable and how these features improve their training efficiency and outcomes. This approach allows us to make data-driven decisions about where to invest further in AI development.\n\nA specific example comes from our training summary feature. Initially, we noticed a moderate usage rate. After gathering user feedback and enhancing the feature, usage spiked by 40%. This not only validated our investment but also highlighted the importance of continuous improvement based on real user data. Such insights have been pivotal in guiding our development priorities and ensuring that our AI initiatives align with customer needs and deliver tangible benefits.\n\nAlmog Koren, CEO & Founder, DogBaase\n\nAssess AI-Driven Human Capital Cost Savings\n\n(ROI) of AI initiatives can be seen within three buckets:\n\nHuman Capital Cost: If an AI tool reduces the workload, for instance, from 40 hours to 2 hours per week, it becomes crucial. Although this reduction isn't always easy to measure precisely, end-users can typically provide approximate figures. This saving should be assessed from a \"bottom-up\" approach. Enabling New Applications: If an AI tool enables your customers to do things more efficiently, this will be essential to have (due to competition, premium pricing, etc.). Metrics for this should be derived from the customer discovery division, focusing on how the tool enhances customer capabilities and satisfaction. Infrastructure Cost Savings: Easiest to estimate. An AI tool that reduces the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or other operational expenses can be assessed by comparing savings versus investment.\n\nAyush Goyal, CTO, Lightscline Inc\n\nFocus on Cost Savings and Customer Satisfaction\n\nAs a Principal Data Scientist at Boomi, we measure AI ROI by focusing on cost savings, increased sales, and customer satisfaction. For example, our AI-powered integration platform, BoomiGPT, has reduced manual process-building time, leading to substantial cost savings and freeing up resources for more strategic tasks. Additionally, our AI agent framework, launching soon, will enable customer customization through conversational AI, further improving customer satisfaction and retention metrics.\n\nThese metrics not only showcase AI's impact but also help us continually innovate and improve our offerings.\n\nSwagata Ashwani, Principal Data Scientist\n\nAnalyze AI's Impact on Efficiency and Revenue\n\nDetermining the success of AI projects in my startup involves looking at a few main factors. We first analyze how much money we save by using AI to automate tasks and cut down on labor and operational expenses. We also measure how AI has made our processes more efficient and productive by speeding up tasks and helping us allocate resources better.\n\nCustomer satisfaction measures are important because they show how AI can improve the quality of service and the overall experience for users. This includes tracking customer retention rates and Net Promoter Score (NPS) to see how AI enhancements affect customer loyalty and engagement.\n\nRevenue growth is an important factor that we pay attention to, as it shows the direct effect of using AI technology to boost sales through personalized recommendations, predictive analytics, and improved marketing tactics.\n\nFinally, assessing how easily our AI solutions can grow and adapt is important to ensure they can help our business expand and quickly respond to changing market needs. By thoroughly examining these factors, we can understand the real advantages and return on investment of our AI spending, which helps us make smart decisions and encourage continuous innovation in our startup.\n\nMatthew Ramirez, Founder, Rephrasely\n\nMonitor AI's Contribution to Business Goals\n\nMeasuring the return on investment (ROI) of AI goes beyond maximizing resource allocation and spending justification; it also promotes an accountable culture within enterprises. Businesses can hold teams accountable for meeting goals by monitoring the value created by AI efforts. A startup must take many crucial measures in order to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) of its AI endeavors.\n\nClearly state what the AI initiative's goals are. Choose the precise metrics that will be used to gauge the project's performance. These measures could include improvements in customer satisfaction, revenue growth, cost reductions, efficiency benefits, or other pertinent Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n\nEstablish a reference point prior to putting the AI initiative into action. This could entail gathering information on current performance measures associated with the goals of the campaign.\n\nChoose the right time frame for ROI calculations. Some AI projects could require more time to pay for themselves since they require an upfront infrastructure or training data investment. Take into account qualitative effects that are significant for overall business performance but may not be easily quantifiable, such as strengthened competitive positioning or better decision-making skills.\n\nA financial organization uses AI to detect fraud. The quantity of fraudulent transactions that are stopped, protecting the company's financial resources, determines the ROI. A major retailer uses an online chatbot to answer consumer questions concerning refunds, order tracking, and product availability. A startup's influence and efficacy can be determined by analyzing several critical criteria when determining the return on investment (ROI) of AI projects. Cost savings, revenue growth, productivity and efficiency, quality and accuracy, risk mitigation, and customer satisfaction are the metrics.\n\nDr. Manash Sarkar, Expert Data Scientist, Limendo GmbH\n\nCombine Intuition with Solid Data\n\nFiguring out the return on investment (ROI) of AI tools is a mix of intuition and solid data. First off, we rely on a simple test: If a tool makes our work easier and more efficient, it's a winner. It's like getting a new gadget that everyone loves because it saves time and effort.\n\nBut we also dig into some important metrics to get a clearer picture. One key metric is time saved. We compare how long tasks took before and after we started using AI. For example, if generating reports used to take hours and now only takes minutes, we calculate the time saved and translate that into cost savings and higher productivity. This shows us the real value of the tool in everyday terms.\n\nAnother crucial metric is accuracy improvement. AI often makes our work more precise. We look at error rates before and after implementing AI. For instance, if an AI model improves our forecasting accuracy from 80% to 95%, we see how this leads to better decisions and fewer mistakes.\n\nWe also check in with our team using net promoter scores (NPS). We asked them how satisfied they were with the AI tools and if they'd recommend them to others. High scores mean the tools are not only efficient but also liked, showing they're well-integrated into our workflow.\n\nCombining these metrics gives us a complete view of the ROI of our AI initiatives. This way, we're not just looking at financial returns but also at how AI makes our overall operations and decision-making better.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Louis Mommens, CEO, Linkody\n\nTrack AI's Influence on Operations and Experience\n\nAt Cafely, we use AI where it can really make a difference -- optimizing warehouse space to save money, suggesting the perfect roast for each customer, ensuring smoother operations, and improving customer experience. Before we dove into AI, we established a performance baseline. What are our current processing times? Sales figures? Customer satisfaction? Then, we factored in the costs of bringing AI on board: software, training, and maintenance. Once AI is up and running, we track the impact. Did we shave seconds off our processing time? Did personalized recommendations boost our sales? Are customers raving about the service?\n\nAlso, we invest heavily in cleaning and validating data. High-quality data is the secret to both AI performance and accurate ROI calculations. Remember, ROI isn't a one-and-done deal. We don't just throw AI at the wall and see what sticks. We keep a close eye on these metrics and tweak our AI strategies here and there. It's all about constantly learning and upgrading to make Cafely the smoothest experience ever.\n\nMimi Nguyen, Founder, Cafely\n\nCapture Productivity Gains and Cost Reductions\n\nOur startup uses modern metrics to determine the ROI of an AI initiative, capturing productivity gains, cost reductions, and better decision-making. Improved productivity is estimated via increased output or efficiency directly attributable to AI's automation of functions, such as shorter cycle times and higher throughput.\n\nThe financial benefits of our AI initiatives are substantial. We measure cost reductions in terms of the savings in labor and operational costs, taking into account the decreased need for manual input and error correction. This has led to a significant reduction in our operational expenses, contributing to our financial health. Furthermore, improved decision-making, as a result of AI-based decision support, has led to more accurate and timely decisions, further enhancing our financial performance.\n\nFinally, we track a range of satisfaction and engagement metrics among our customers and users to ensure that AI-driven improvements provide better customer and user experiences. All this leads to an overall assessment of how AI impacts our business objectives and bottom line. Based on this, we can be confident that our investment in AI is making a difference.\n\nGeorge Blandford, Co-Founder, UK Linkology\n\nGauge Financial Impact with Cost-Benefit Ratio\n\nMeasuring the ROI of AI initiatives at our startup involves a multi-faceted approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative metrics to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. The crucial metric we focus on is the Cost-Benefit Ratio (CBR). This metric allows us to gauge the financial impact by comparing the total costs of implementing AI solutions against the monetary benefits derived from them.\n\nWe track parameters such as increased revenue, reduced operational costs, and enhanced productivity as part of our benefit calculation. Regularly reviewing CBR empowers us to make data-driven decisions, ensuring our AI investments align perfectly with our strategic goals and deliver maximum value.\n\nAustin Benton, Marketing Consultant, Gotham Artists\n\nExamine Cost Reduction Through AI Implementation\n\nAs someone who manages a language-learning platform, I have already incorporated many AI tools into our processes, and I think the most critical metric for businesses is COST REDUCTION. To measure the ROI of these AI initiatives, I have to ask myself: Did these AI initiatives eliminate any costs? Were the labor costs reduced? Were the processing times quicker? Are there fewer errors? For me, examining the cost reduction made possible through AI implementation is crucial for determining its impact on the bottom line.\n\nFor example, when we implemented an AI system for our HR department that handled the most critical facets of our HR team, such as payroll management, time tracking, tax filing, and leave requests, I would say it streamlined their efforts and made it quicker for them to do the most time-consuming tasks. Even though our employees grew, we did not add more HR staff to accommodate all the tasks. The cost savings are mainly on not needing to hire more HR staff, lowering the employee churn rate because employees are more satisfied with HR services, and improving operational efficiency due to fewer errors. I'd say that examining these aspects helped paint a clear picture of AI's overt benefits, supporting the rationale behind AI integration.\n\nStefano Lodola, Owner, Language Course Author, Polyglot, Think Languages LLC\n\nRelated Articles How is AI Personalization Impacting Your Startup's Marketing Strategy?

Crucially, UK businesses may be subject to the Act if they deploy AI in the EU.\n\nOver the next few months we'll focus in on different aspects of the Act and the practical implications to help affected organisations prepare. Watch out for our series of snapshot articles on what you need to know.\n\nWhat's it all about?\n\nGovernments across the globe have been grappling for a while now with how best to regulate AI, as the technology advances at a rapid pace. International collaboration continues, but national approaches are diverging.\n\nWith the EU choosing to specifically legislate, the United Kingdom currently has no plans to do so - instead, empowering existing regulators to produce tailored, context-specific approaches that suit the way AI's being used in their sectors.\n\nWho has to comply with the EU AI Act?\n\nObligations are placed on various operators in the AI value chain - providers and their authorised representatives, deployers, importers, distributors and product manufacturers.\n\nNote that non-EU based businesses will still be caught if they put an AI system into service or place it on the EU market, or the output produced by the AI system is used there. We'll be covering this in more detail in a future article.\n\nThere are additional obligations for providers of so-called 'general-purpose AI' models, which include large generative AI models. These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, can be used to perform a wide range of distinct tasks, and may be integrated into a lot of AI systems. Generative AI can be thought of as a subset of AI that can create content such as text, audio, images or video. ChatGPT is an example.\n\nWhat's an AI system?\n\nThere's no universally accepted definition of AI or AI system. It's essentially a computer system that can perform tasks usually requiring human intelligence. The EU AI Act uses the following definition, which is closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on AI and is designed to be future-proof:\n\n\"A machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments\".\n\nSo what does this actually mean?\n\nWe're not talking here about simple traditional software systems or programming approaches, or systems where the output is pre-defined based on a set of rules fed in by a human.\n\nA key characteristic is the capability of the system to infer, from inputs or data, how to generate outputs. It goes beyond basic data programming by enabling learning, reasoning or modelling. Autonomy refers to independence from human involvement. Adaptiveness after deployment refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use.\n\nRisk categories and obligations\n\nThe EU AI Act categorises AI systems according to risk, with some banned altogether. The nature and extent of obligations will depend on the type of operator and the risk category:\n\nMinimal/no risk: Covers most AI systems, including AI-enabled recommender systems and video games, and spam filters. They can be used freely, and organisations can commit voluntarily to codes of conduct.\n\nLimited/specific transparency risk: Refers to the risks associated with lack of transparency in AI usage. Users of AI systems such as chatbots should be aware that they're interacting with a machine. Deep fakes and other AI-generated content will have to be identifiable and labelled, and users told when biometric categorisation or emotion recognition systems are used.\n\nHigh-risk: AI systems will be high-risk where they're either (1) products or safety components of products covered by specific EU legislation listed in the Act and subject to a third-party conformity assessment, or (2) listed in Annex III of the Act (except where the system doesn't pose a significant risk of harm to people's health, safety or fundamental rights, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making). Examples include certain uses in: biometrics; critical infrastructure; educational and vocational training; employment and management of workers; and essential public and private services such as credit scoring.\n\nThere are extensive obligations in relation to quality and risk management, documentation and traceability, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, cyber security and robustness.\n\nUnacceptable risk: AI systems considered a clear threat to the fundamental rights of people will be banned. They include harmful uses such as: social scoring; exploitation of vulnerabilities; subliminal techniques; certain biometric categorisation; emotion recognition systems at the workplace and in education; untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for facial images to build up or expand databases.\n\nWhat should you do now?\n\nIf the Act applies to your organisation, you should assess the AI systems you use (or are considering using) against the various risk categories so that you can identify and understand your obligations and plan accordingly.\n\nWe'll be covering the risk categories and associated obligations in more detail in a follow-up article. In the meantime, please get in touch with Sally or Andrew if you have any queries or concerns.\n\nTiming\n\nThe EU AI Act is likely to enter into force in August 2024. The ban on systems that pose an unacceptable risk will apply 6 months later and the general-purpose AI rules after 12 months. The majority of provisions, including those on high-risk systems, will apply in 2 years' time.\n\nThese range from up to \u20ac7.5 million or 1% of total worldwide annual turnover (whichever is higher) to up to \u20ac35 million or 7% of total worldwide annual turnover (whichever is higher), depending on the nature of the infringement.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recommender system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emotion recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robustness (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email filtering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conformity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

But the opponents of the legislation are certain that it would kill innovation and doom the entire AI industry.\n\nIn May this year, the California legislature passed the controversial bill, which is currently being advanced by various committees. Following a final vote in August, the bill could be ascended for Gavin Newsom, the governor of the state, to sign into law. If that happens, SB 1047 would become the country's first major law regulating AI in a state where many big tech companies are located.\n\nWhat does the bill propose?\n\nAlso known as the 'Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Systems Act', SB 1047 looks to hold top AI companies such as Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral responsible for the potential catastrophic dangers that come attached with the rapidly advancing technology.\n\nThe bill mainly applies to entities rolling out large frontier AI models, with the term \"large\" being defined in the bill as those AI systems trained using computing power of 10^26 floating operations per second (FLOPS) with the training process costing more than USD $100 million (Rs 834 crore, approximately). AI models that have been fine tuned using computing power greater than three times 10^25 FLOPS also come under the bill.\n\n\"If not properly subject to human controls, future development in artificial intelligence may also have the potential to be used to create novel threats to public safety and security, including by enabling the creation and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, as well as weapons with cyber-offensive capabilities,\" the bill reads.\n\nAs per the latest draft of the bill, developers behind large frontier AI models can be held liable for \"critical harms\". These harms include using AI to create chemical or nuclear weapons and launching cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. It also covers human crimes committed by AI models acting with limited human oversight that result in death, bodily injury, and property damage.\n\nIn order to ensure compliance, AI models are required to undergo independent audits by third party auditors. Developers who violate the proposed provisions of the bill could face legal action by California's attorney general. They would also have to mandatorily comply with safety standards recommended by a new AI certifying body called the 'Frontier Model Division' that is envisaged to be set up by the California government.\n\nWhy has the bill sparked uproar?\n\nEssentially, the draft legislation encapsulates the perspectives voiced by AI doomers. It has been backed by tech industry figures such as Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, who broadly believe that AI could end humanity and must, therefore, be regulated. One of the sponsors of the bill is the Centre for AI Safety which published an open letter stating that the risks posed by AI were just as severe as nuclear wars or another pandemic.\n\nWhile the bill is receiving support from these quarters, it has been heavily criticised by nearly everyone else. One of the main arguments against the bill is that it would effectively eliminate open source AI models.\n\nWhen AI models are open source, it means that their inner workings can be freely accessed or modified by anyone, thus ensuring greater transparency and improved security. But the proposed California bill could discourage companies like Meta from making their AI models open source as they could be held responsible for other developers misusing the technology.\n\nExperts have also pointed out that preventing AI systems from misbehaving is more complicated than it seems. Hence, placing the regulatory burden solely on AI companies is not entirely fair, especially since the prescribed safety standards in the bill are not flexible enough for a fast-growing technology like AI.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karan_mahadik@indianexpress.com", "name": "Karan Mahadik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FLOPS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshua Bengio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geoffrey Hinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Tech-feature-images2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Only five percent of businesses are using AI, according to a US Census Bureau report flagged by The Economist, and that number is only projected to rise to about 6.6 percent by this autumn.\n\nAdoption rates may be stymied by concerns over hallucinations, when AI just makes stuff up, and security and privacy issues because these models are essentially black boxes that may spit out important trade secrets.\n\nIn other words, there's a huge amount of hype -- but so far, the only companies making much actual revenue off AI are the ones selling the hardware it needs, like Nvidia.\n\nIn a report last month on generative AI, Goldman Sachs Jim Covello had harsh words for the industry.\n\n\"AI technology is exceptionally expensive, and to justify those costs, the technology must be able to solve complex problems, which it isn't designed to do,\" he said.\n\nYes, AI is expensive to deploy and run, not even counting its harmful impact on the environment.

But it also comes with some serious challenges, including ethical considerations and the need for personalized data.\n\nIn a lively panel discussion at the GenAI Summit 2024 in San Francisco, experts in artificial intelligence and education gathered to explore the transformative potential of generative AI in reshaping the classroom of the future. The discussion, titled \"AI and Education: Building the Future Classroom,\" featured prominent voices in the field who shared insights on how AI technologies can enhance learning experiences and address longstanding educational challenges.\n\nThe session was led by Hamza Farooq, adjunct professor at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, lecturer for Stanford University Continuing Studies, and founder of traversal.ai. He pointed to what is widely seen as a significant shift from traditional classroom settings to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The pandemic forced everyone to attend online courses and complete their education remotely,\" Farooq said, setting the stage for a conversation on the future of education in the age of generative AI.\n\nBryan Talebi, CEO and co-founder of Ahura AI, emphasized the potential of AI to revolutionize education by enabling personalized learning experiences. \"We invented technology that allows people to learn three to five times faster than traditional education methods,\" said Talebi, who has a background in building satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"The role of teachers will shift towards focusing on the psychosocial development of students, while AI provides hyper-personalized teaching.\"\n\nYao Du, a clinical assistant professor in speech-language pathology at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, shared her experience integrating AI tools into her curriculum. \"I spent the summer teaching my students how to use ChatGPT for their assignments,\" she said. \"It levels the playing field for all students and enhances productivity while maintaining ethical considerations around data privacy.\"\n\nDerek Gong, the founder of CoursePals, a startup focused on education technology, and a Stanford master's student, discussed the practical applications of AI in education. \"Our product integrates GPT with group chat to facilitate better interaction between professors and students,\" Gong explained. \"AI can handle repetitive tasks, allowing professors to focus on more intellectually rewarding aspects of teaching.\"\n\nThe panel also addressed concerns about AI's impact on employment. Talebi acknowledged the potential for significant job displacement but stressed the importance of retraining workers for the jobs of tomorrow. \"We need to find a way to retrain one to two billion adults over the next five to six years,\" he said. \"If we don't, we could face mass suffering, war, and civil unrest.\"\n\nAs the discussion concluded, the panelists agreed on the need for a balanced approach to AI integration in education, ensuring that technology enhances rather than replaces human interaction. \"AI is here to reinforce our learning and clinical services, not replace us,\" Du said.\n\nThe GenAI Summit's final session underscored the critical role of AI in shaping the future of education, promising a future where technology and human expertise coexist to create more effective and inclusive learning environments.\n\nThis year's GenAI Summit is the second annual event organized by GPT Dao, a global generative AI community. According to event organizers, this year's summit drew an estimated 10,000 attendees and 300 exhibitors. The list of exhibitors at this year's conference includes Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon.

It's so much faster than a human, that it can monitor a lot more, and it can often see patterns that are invisible to us.\n\nUnlike human agents, AI tools can monitor a nearly unlimited number of transactions in real-time as they occur, and can use several methods to spot potential issues. This includes noticing anomalies, such as overly large or unusual transactions, and watching for suspicious purchasing patterns that might suggest fraud is occurring.\n\nWhen AI tools spot a potential fraud, they may be able to notify an employee, halt all transactions, or follow other instructions you have provided. However, there are several unique styles of fraud detection AI, and the report suggests that using the correct software for each business is essential.\n\nNot All Fraud Is EqualScott Hall's new report focuses on three primary types of fraud: payment fraud, account takeover fraud, and return and refund fraud.\n\nYou can find detailed information about each type of fraud, how it can be used maliciously, and how the correct AI tools can be used to prevent it or to flag the issue for employees, in the full guide. I suggest you do, if fraud is a problem for you - because as they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nCustomization CountsAlthough \"off-the-shelf\" AI systems exist, Scott Hall suggests that most AI tools are only as effective as their training, and highlights the benefits of custom learning for each business. You can learn about three types of AI training, how to use each one, and how to combine them effectively, in the free guide.\n\nAn excerpt from the full write-up explains, \"The first step in training your AI system is to gather the right data. This includes information from previous transactions, how customers behave, and any other important details. It's crucial to make sure the data is correct and related to the kind of fraud you're trying to find.\"\n\nIt's your business, and I wouldn't want to try and tell you how to run it.\n\nI will tell you this though, it's a lot easier with AI.\n\nIt doesn't have to do any more work than you want it to - but it's certainly easier, faster, and more efficient when used in the right ways.\n\nIf you're looking to upgrade your security with some AI tools, read the full expert guide first, and then make your move.\n\nYou can find the full guide at https://scotthall.co/how-small-businesses-can-use-ai-to-help-detect-fraud", "source": {"uri": "firmenpresse.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "firmenpresse.de"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial off-the-shelf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.firmenpresse.de/images/logo.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Undoubtedly, many investors may go for the so-called Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech titans for their AI exposure.\n\nWhile there's no problem with this, I think there are also great AI plays on the TSX Index, many of which may trade at better valuations relative to long-term growth. Indeed, AI stocks aren't without their fair share of risk. So, Canadian investors should ensure they're paying close attention to the valuation of firms, even those with rock-solid long-term AI growth strategies.\n\nTop-notch AI innovations cost money to build. And unless there's a good chance of enhanced profitability prospects in the future, investors may wish to hold off until the price of a given stock is in a better spot.\n\nIn this piece, we'll consider two Canadian companies that could be riding on big AI tailwinds. While they may not have ChatGPT-like large language models (LLMs) or small language models (SLMs) for the public today, I certainly would not count them out as they look to steadily improve their footing on the front of AI-driven technology.\n\nConsider shares of media and information juggernaut Thomson Reuters (TSX:TRI) and Shopify (TSX:SHOP), two Canadian firms with bigger AI chops than you'd think. Though AI tailwinds could take a few years to really drive the results, I do think that each firm is worth stashing on a watchlist in case a market-wide pullback grants investors an opportunity to pay two or three quarters to get a full dollar, so to speak.\n\nRight now, each firm looks more or less fully valued. However, if things go right with their AI plans, perhaps they may prove deeply undervalued right here. In any case, let's check out the two names.\n\nThomson Reuters stock has been on a red-hot rally of late, up more than 74% in the past two years. After a strong first quarter result (and sales guidance hike for the full year) and ambitious AI plans, it should be no mystery why shares of TRI are trading at a slight premium nowadays. At 32.5 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), the price of admission is getting a tad steep.\n\nThat said, Thomson Reuters isn't just a firm in the business of delivering the latest news. The company's CEO, Steve Hasker, was quite clear in noting that \"We're a tech stock, not a media stock.\" He's right.\n\nIf anything, Thomson Reuters is more of an AI-driven tech stock that could compete with the heavyweights south of the border. As Hasker and company pull the AI growth lever, perhaps a richer multiple is justified for shares.\n\nShopify isn't just an e-commerce company; it's an AI-driven tech innovator that can expand market share by leaps and bounds over the next four to five years. Indeed, Shopify has been in the AI game for more than a year now. However, recently, the firm launched more new AI features across its suite. Indeed, the AI features sprinkled here and there probably won't cause merchants to pay markedly higher monthly fees.\n\nHowever, as Shopify's AI toolkit swells in size, I think Shopify may just be able to convince its users that its AI innovations are more than worth the added costs. Seeing as AI is helping so many small businesses save time and money, I view Shopify's take on AI as one that could really move the needle in the long term. Regarding AI-enabled e-commerce firms, Shopify has to be close to the top of the list.", "source": {"uri": "fool.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_frenette@fool.ca", "name": "Joey Frenette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomson Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopify", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shopify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1473086836-1200x686.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

AI could be prompted to forget low-quality data, pushing the development of methods to selectively \"unlearn\" data. Speech recognition technology opens up video and podcast data for AI training, while synthetic data offers a future solution for AI growth.\n\nArtificial intelligence needs training data, but that data is limited. So, how else can we train AI so that it continues to grow and be useful to us?\n\nYou might think the internet and its data are inexhaustible resources, but AI tools are running out of data to mine. Now, before you worry, it's not going to stop AI development -- there's plenty of data still ready to train AI systems.\n\n1 There's Always More Data Added Online\n\nIn short, AI research institute Epoch says the high-quality data on which AI is being trained could run out by 2026.\n\nThe key word there is \"could.\" The amount of data added to the internet every year increases, so something drastic may change before 2026. Still, it's a fair estimate -- either way, AI systems will run out of good data at some point.\n\nWe should remember, however, that some 147 zettabytes of data are added online every year (as per Exploding Topics). Just one zettabyte is equal to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bits of data. In real terms (well, somewhat real), that's more than 30 billion 4K movies (real, but unfathomable). It's a startling amount of information for AI to sift through.\n\nNonetheless, AI consumes data faster than humanity can create it...\n\n2 AI Could Forget Low-Quality Data\n\nNot all that 147 zettabytes of data is good data, of course. There's a lot more to it than meets the eye. But it's estimated that AI will have used up low-quality language data by 2050, too.\n\nReuters reported that Photobucket, once one of the world's largest picture repositories, was in talks to license its extensive library to AI training firms. Image data has trained systems like DALL-E and Midjourney, but even that could run out by 2060. There's a bigger issue here, too: Photobucket housed images from 2000s social media platforms like Myspace, meaning they're not as high a standard as current photography. This leads to low-quality data.\n\nPhotobucket isn't alone. In February 2024, Google struck a deal with Reddit, allowing the search giant to use the social media platform's user data in its AI training. Other social media platforms are also providing user data for AI training purposes; some are using it to train in-house AI models, such as Meta's Llama.\n\nHowever, while some information can be gleaned from low-quality data, Microsoft is reportedly developing a way for AI to selectively \"unlearn\" data. Primarily, this would be used for IP issues, but it could also mean tools can forget what they've learned from low-quality data sets.\n\nWe could feed AI more data without being too selective; those AI systems could then pick and choose what's most beneficial to learn from.\n\n3 Speech Recognition Opens Up Video and Podcast Data\n\nData fed to AI tools has so far consisted largely of text and, to a lesser extent, images. That will undoubtedly change, and likely already has, as speech recognition software will mean the wealth of videos and podcasts available can also train AI.\n\nNotably, OpenAI developed the open-source, automatic speech recognition (ASR) neural network, Whisper, using 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitasking data. OpenAI then fed over a million hours of information from YouTube videos into its large language model, GPT-4.\n\nThis is an ideal template for other AI systems, which use speech recognition to transcribe videos and audio from numerous sources and run that data through their AI models.\n\nAccording to Statista, over 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, a number that's remained fairly consistent since 2019. That's without mentioning other video and audio platforms like Dailymotion and Podbean. If AI can turn its attention to new data sets like these, there's a huge amount of information still to be mined.\n\n4 AIs Have Largely Stuck to the English Language\n\nThat's not all we can learn from Whisper. OpenAI trained the model using 117,000 hours of non-English audio data. This is especially interesting because many AI systems have been trained primarily using English or viewing other cultures through the Western lens.\n\nIn essence, most tools are limited by the culture of their creators.\n\nTake ChatGPT as an example. Shortly after its release in 2022, Jill Walker Rettberg, professor of Digital Culture at the University of Bergen, Norway, tried ChatGPT out and concluded:\n\n\"ChatGPT doesn't know much about Norwegian culture. Or rather, whatever it knows about Norwegian culture is presumably mostly learned from English language sources... ChatGPT is explicitly aligned with US values and laws. In many cases these are close to Norwegian and European values, but presumably this will not always be the case.\"\n\nAIs, then, can develop the more multinational people interact with them -- or the more diverse languages and cultures are used to train such systems. Right now, many artificial intelligences have been confined to a single library; they can grow if given the keys to libraries across the world.\n\n5 Publishing Houses Could Help Develop AIs\n\nIP is obviously a massive issue, but some publishers could help develop AIs by making licensing agreements. This would mean giving tools high-quality, i.e., reliable, data from books rather than potentially low-quality information gleaned from online sources.\n\nIn fact, Meta, the owners of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, reportedly considered buying Simon & Schuster, one of the \"Big Five\" publishing houses. The idea was to use literature published by the firm to train Meta's own AI. The deal ultimately fell through, perhaps owing to the ethical gray area of the company processing IPs without prior consent from writers.\n\nAnother option apparently considered was buying individual licensing rights on new titles. This should cause great concerns for creatives, but it will still be an interesting way for AI tools to develop if usable data is exhausted.\n\n6 Synthetic Data Is the Future\n\nEvery other solution is still limited, but one option could see AI thrive far into the future: synthetic data. And it's already being investigated as a very real possibility.\n\nSo, what is synthetic data? In this sense, it's data created by AI; just as humans create data, this method would see artificial intelligence generate data for training purposes.\n\nIn effect, an AI could create a convincing deepfake video. That deepfake video could be fed back into an AI so that it can learn from what is essentially an imaginary scenario. That is, after all, one major way humans learn: we read or watch something in order to understand the world around us.\n\nAIs are likely to have already consumed synthetic information. Deepfakes circulated online spread misinformation and disinformation, so as AI systems scan the internet, it makes sense that some will have been subject to faked content.\n\nYes, there's an insidious side to this. It could also damage or limit AIs, reinforcing and spreading mistakes made by those tools. Companies are working to eradicate the latter problem; still, \"AIs learning from each other and making errors\" is a plot point of many sci-fi nightmare scenarios.\n\n7\n\nAI is controversial. There are plenty of downsides to it, but detractors ignore its benefits. For instance, audit and advisory network PwC [PDF] suggests AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the world's economy by 2030.\n\nWhat's more, AI is already being used all over the world.

Insufficient or poor quality data with errors and anomalies will undermine the trustworthiness of AI-based insights.

AI is expected to significantly affect productivity, investment, consumption, and other aspects of the financial system, all of which affect price and financial stability.\n\nAI will also have a much more direct impact as it's increasingly integrated into operations by commercial and central banks. BIS believes that, in time, the latter will rely heavily on AI to supervise, set monetary policy, and ensure financial stability.\n\nAI has \"a direct bearing on how central banks do their jobs,\" commented the Head of Research at the BIS, Hyun Song Shin.\n\n\"Vast amounts of data could provide us with faster and richer information to detect patterns and latent risks in the economy and financial system. All this could help central banks predict and steer the economy better,\" he added.\n\nSeveral major central banks have already started using AI. The Bank of England (BoE) revealed in April that it was using the technology \"where appropriate, to support and enhance [its] capabilities.\"\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) announced in September 2023 that it was also using AI in a \"careful embrace\" of the technology.\n\nOthers, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, are more reserved, with officials saying that they are exploring the technology but don't plan to use it at the policy level.\n\nAI also comes with its challenges, BIS acknowledged in its report. They include enhanced cyber-attack risks and fraud. It could also exacerbate some existing challenges, such as bias and discrimination relating to consumer protection and fair lending practices.\n\nOverall, AI can be a net positive for the global financial system if central banks embrace it and keep up with the rapid pace of advancements, the banking industry standard setter says.\n\nBIS is taking the lead. Through Project Aurora, it has found that AI is more adept at detecting dirty money than traditional methods. It has also used AI to enhance cyber resilience through Project Raven.\n\nIn order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership -- allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Many analysts believe AI growth stocks have plenty more potential. This is despite already generating fabulous returns. Even the more enthusiastic analysts acknowledge that much of how it can be monetized has not been achieved yet.\n\nA recent report from Bloomberg Intelligence suggests that Generative AI alone could become a $1.3 trillion business over the next ten years. This implies a 42% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Demand for large language models, digital ads, and specialized software services are among the applications expected to grow explosively in the medium to long term.\n\nMany software companies will likely not see profits from their investments in AI until next year. However, these investments have driven demand in other areas, such as chipmakers, semiconductor manufacturers, data center infrastructure specialists and other service providers.\n\nThat implies that there are many AI stocks with explosive growth potential, including relatively cheap AI growth stocks that could offer more upside. Here are three such AI growth stocks.\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the companies focused on capturing growth opportunities in the AI market. The chipmaker lost server CPU market share in previous years and was slower than competitors in expanding its AI product portfolio.\n\nYet, Intel has regained momentum with three consecutive quarters of rising server CPU market share, now at 64% compared to AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) 33%. Recently, it launched its new Xeon 6 line of processors targeting the AI sector, which is currently dominated by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD.\n\nThe company is working to streamline operations and increase earnings growth faster than sales. Last quarter, its client computing division, which provides CPUs for consumer devices, saw a 31% revenue jump. Intel also boosted gross margin, signaling stronger profitability.\n\nAnalyst sentiment has turned more positive, with a majority now rating Intel stock a buy. The average price target stands at $38.67, implying a 26% upside potential. Intel remains undervalued at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.7x compared to the 47.8x multiple for the broader tech sector. This combination earns Intel a place as one of the AI growth stocks to buy.\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) showcases the versatility of AI and how it can enable unexpected business changes that are hard to foresee. Due to reduced mining rewards from the Bitcoin halving, small crypto miners have struggled to maintain profitable operations.\n\nAI demands significant computing power, however. Riot Platforms has computing resources from Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining and data center infrastructure available. Last year, it began supplying excess power to the electrical grid through ERCOT's distribution platform, generating revenue from \"saved\" power. The company also stated it would look into the supply of computation power to the AI sector.\n\nCurrently, Riot Platforms is pursuing the acquisition of Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) to expand infrastructure and realize greater economies of scale if completed. Trading at a P/E ratio of 23.4x, Riot Platforms' valuation remains relatively low compared to the tech industry. All analysts recommend RIOT stock as a buy and forecast an average target price of $18.14 per share, indicating over 93% upside potential. Combined with the rest, this explosive growth makes RIOT one of the AI growth stocks to buy.\n\nThe Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) web browser has remained popular among technology enthusiasts, though its market share has been surpassed by Chrome. Still, Opera's focus on AI integration is noteworthy.\n\nEarlier this year, the company invested over $20 million to build an AI computing cluster powered by renewable energy in Iceland. This makes it the first and currently only browser designed with on-device AI capabilities. Since implementing this AI strategy, the company's average revenue per user has increased by 24%. Further developing AI features could potentially broaden Opera's appeal.\n\nWhile Opera's financials have not fully benefited as one of AI growth stocks, analysts recognize the company's potential. OPRA stock is trading below analysts ' expectations with a P/E ratio of only 7.4x while boasting an uncommon dividend yield of 5.9% for a technology company.\n\nAnalyst ratings are unanimously positive, with an average price target representing over 60% upside from current levels.

However, like any leading tech, AI must be used judiciously to create a harmonious blend of innovation and responsibility.\n\nAlmost all brands and organizations are implementing generative AI in some aspects to ease up their workforce. As well as providing such features as a USP to stay unique among the other crowd.\n\nThe Morning Consult and IBM surveyed IT professionals and found that 59% of Indian enterprises actively deploying AI for organizational use cases, placing India top among other countries in AI adoption.\n\nDespite this progress, challenges persist, a study revealed that 63% of citizens are concerned about the misuse of AI and personal data. This confirms their research 3 years ago claims that 76% of consumers are unaware of how companies handle sensitive data on AI, and 36% don't trust companies to use their credentials ethically.(Source : KPMG)\n\nData breaches by unauthorized access are growing concerns; you might have even encountered spam calls to your number or emails as we are bound to use either our phone number or email address as one unique ID for any transactions.\n\nThese privacy concerns grow as any data-aided technology becomes more pervasive, and the need for responsible development and deployment becomes paramount. Few steps have been initiated and deployed and this is in the right direction for future of AI technology in India.\n\nIndia's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has come up with new and revised the AI regulations. Which highlighted the importance of considering transparency and user empowerment.\n\nThe major points in the revised regulations are as follows:\n\nThe new advisory promotes self-regulation (industry-specific), accountability, and transparency while fostering innovation and protecting societal interests. It marks a new chapter in India's AI regulation, for positive and inclusive change.\n\nHowever, companies and individuals must adhere to the norms set out. At the moment about 46% of companies have initiated training and upskilling employees to work with new automation and AI tools to stay competitive in market and also stay updated in the ecosystem. This movement is critical, as per report 30% of employees reported having limited AI skills and expertise.\n\nThe Indian AI ecosystem is getting stronger day by day with torch baring companies like Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro. Startups like Haloocom, ZestMoney, SigTuple, and Niramai are focusing on diverse domains, including healthcare, finance, agriculture, and customer service.\n\nTo build a responsible technological future, companies should focus on:\n\nAs we move forward, it's crucial to remember that any advancement in technology is a tool, not a cure-all and using the right tool can be still decided by humans. The power lies in capabilities and how we choose to wield it. By fostering transparency, promoting education, and prioritizing ethical considerations, we can ensure that technology becomes a force for positive change in India.\n\nThe future of advanced technology in India is bright, but it requires careful cultivation. Like a well-balanced curry, it needs the right mix of innovation, regulation, and a tincture of responsibility. As we continue to stir this technological pot, let's ensure that the flavor we create benefits all of society.", "source": {"uri": "techiexpert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techiexpert.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buzzword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spamming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Electronics_and_Information_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wipro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infosys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Consultancy_Services", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tata Consultancy Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.techiexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ingredients-For-Best-AI-Building-a-Responsible-Future-in-India-Levis-Wilson-CEO-Haloocom.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Senior tech companies' next AI bet, however, is not just generative AI tools, but the infusion of various AI tools from the onset into their products. As a result, smartphones and laptops with a focus on Artificial Intelligence are rapidly appearing in the market.\n\nAI Laptops refer to portable computers that are preprogrammed with certification and hardware that propels specific algorithms for AI operations. They may include conventional ML techniques to sophisticate neural networks and deep learning algorithms.\n\nAn AI PC or a laptop consists of multiple parts through which it becomes superior to the usual laptops. First of all, it incorporates a Central Processing Unit or CPU, a Graphic Processing Unit or GPU, and a Neural Processing Unit or NPU, all of which are embedded with different AI features.\n\nThe latest addition to PCs and laptops would be an NPU, a specialized accelerator that is designed to natively perform AI and machine (ML) tasks on your laptop or PC instead of just cloud processing it. This implies that it would no longer be a tool that one must open from the internet on the laptop but rather the core that drives all activities carried on the laptop.\n\nAI laptops are designed with an emphasis on heavy computational AI activities different from general-purpose laptops for most intended users for AI developers, data scientists, researchers, and AI enthusiasts.\n\nAI laptops are highly portable and could be used in many applications ranging from machine learning, and deep learning to natural language processing. AI laptops enable developers, data scientists, and researchers to train and deploy the models for their uses. These models include computer vision such as image and speech recognition, recommendation systems such as recommendation, and self-driving cars among others.\n\nIntelligent laptops of this kind can be of great utility in data analysis, data pattern identification, and probabilities among others. Besides, AI laptops may also likely be employed in various sectors including in the health and medical sector, the financial sector, in security especially in cybersecurity and in the gaming industries.

For one, journalists can use AI for research, finding interview sources, summarizing documents, and brainstorming article angles.\n\nMeanwhile, fears abound over chatbots and Google AI Overviews taking original reporting and presenting it without sourcing results in websites not receiving the audience they need to keep running. But the ways in which AI has found its way into the industry go beyond just that, as journalists are now using these AI tools in their own work.\n\nRecently, PCMag highlighted this in one of its articles, which discusses the six ways artificial intelligence has entered journalism. Some examples include using AI to find interview subjects, asking chatbots to acquire information they couldn't get on Google, and brainstorming new article ideas.\n\nAs information sources have grown exponentially with blogs and later social media, it's become more difficult than ever to discern real journalism from propaganda or, most recently, entire \"news\" websites created by AI for a few hundred dollars.\n\nSchellmann says, \"ChatGPT is a little bit more limiting because it gets you one result.\" Schellmann goes on, \"The problem with GPT is it's really hard to trust the information because it has so many hallucinations in it.\"\n\nAccording to Schellmann, the most important tenets of journalism are accuracy and \"factually correct content,\" so \"if we really want to employ AI tools, we have to measure how good these tools are at these really important criteria.\" We can \"use these tools according to [that criteria].\"\n\n\"If the tools aren't 100% accurate,\" then we must \"understand what the limitations are and then have use cases.\" As an example, Schellmann highlights Google Pinpoint, a data extraction tool made by Google for journalists that can provide key people and locations. \"If you have 30,000 pages that you got as a dataset, there's no way that you can go through all of them.\"\n\nIf it lists 12 police stations within a requested data set, even though \"you don't actually know that it's 100% a fact,\" you could \"think about the words you're writing\" and express that it's a \"95% accurate tool.\" Schellmann reiterates that \"knowing the limitations of tools can be really helpful to understand the different use cases and how valid this information is.\"\n\nSchellmann doesn't think a Google search results page is a perfect arbiter of data, either.\n\n\"It's interesting that we, these days, think Google search is sort of an objective way of researching. Because it feels like we, as humans kind of control it; we control the inputs.\n\n\"But obviously, that's also already an algorithmically sorted list of results. Instead of getting one answer, we get a bunch that we can choose from. But we don't choose from all of them. We don't go to the last page. We go to the top and look at the first few hits.\"\n\nJonathan Soma, a data journalism professor at Columbia Journalism School who teaches about responsible use of AI in the newsroom. He has a slightly different perspective when asked if trust in journalism would erode as a result of AI being used.\n\n\"For all of the flaws that exist around AI, reader trust is pretty low on a totem pole.\" Soma tells Laptop Mag, explaining how \"issues with reader trust that exist in journalism are not a result of AI.\" He adds it's more a case of \"social and societal issues.\" Soma observes that \"it is possible that people would say, 'Oh, journalists are just using AI. We can't trust them.'\"\n\nBut it's not the reason why journalism has a trust problem. (Confidence in mass media matched a historic low in a 2023 Gallup poll).\n\nSoma understands the weakness of incorporating AI in the newsroom. \"Anything involving truth, AI has no ability to make that sort of judgment call.\" He explains how even if you try to summarize or find something in a document, it's \"very easy for these [language] models to hallucinate and make statements that have no grounding in truth but may be statistically plausible.\"\n\n\"All [these language models] are doing is predicting the next word, which becomes a sentence, a paragraph, a response, and a conversation. And it has nothing to do with the truth.\" Soma explains that \"if you are using AI tools to search through documentation in order to find an answer or marketing materials in order to find what is interesting,\" then you have to \"fact check like crazy because there's no ability to judge whether it is accurate or not.\"\n\nSoma provides an example of something he does during his talks: \"I have a whole schtick where I'm like, 'Here's what GPT says about me.' And based on how you ask the question, it'll give different answers. It will talk about things like a master's degree that I do not have. You can ask a follow-up question about where my master's degree came from, and it's like 'The University of Denver [or] Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.' All of these places that I definitely don't have a master's degree from.\"\n\nWhether AI's use in journalism will negatively affect reader trust seems to be in the air at the moment. Both experts have doubts about using AI chatbots to gain information and say that you'd need to do tons of fact-checking for it to work. Even then, the AI's biases would still be present.\n\nEven though Google has its own biases, Soma thinks ChatGPT is \"much worse,\" and Schellmann says, \"It's really hard to say until we do large-scale studies and compare Google research to ChatGPT.\"", "source": {"uri": "laptopmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LaptopMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "momo_tabari@laptopmag.com", "name": "Momo Tabari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCMag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PCMag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_US", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Future US"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fellow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GUID Partition Table"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University_Graduate_School_of_Journalism", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Denver", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Denver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rySyPXnNF2dZwvYroiL46K-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The promise of AI continues to be highlighted as large tech companies and other corporations will spend an estimated US$1 trillion on capital expenditures (CapEx) in the coming years, the report said, which includes investments in data centers, chips and other elements of AI infrastructure.\n\n\"But this spending has little to show for it so far beyond reports of efficiency gains among developers. And even the stock of the company reaping the most benefits to date -- Nvidia -- has sharply corrected,\" the report said.\n\nThe report highlights an interview with Daron Acemoglu, a professor at MIT, who says he is skeptical about the transformational powers of AI.\n\n\"He estimates that only a quarter of AI-exposed tasks will be cost-effective to automate within the next 10 years, implying that AI will impact less than five per cent of all tasks,\" the report said.\n\nAcemoglu also has questions regarding whether AI will \"create new tasks and products.\"\n\n\"So, he forecasts AI will increase U.S. productivity by only 0.5 per cent and GDP (gross domestic product) growth by only 0.9 per cent cumulatively over the next decade,\" the report said.\n\nJim Covello, the Goldman Sachs head of global equity research, said in the report that AI \"must be able to solve complex problems\" in order to \"earn an adequate return\" on the estimated $1 trillion price tag of developing and operating the technology.\n\nHowever, Covello says he doesn't believe AI is built to solve complex problems.\n\n\"He's also doubtful that AI will boost the valuation of companies that use the tech, as any efficiency gains would likely be competed away, and the path to actually boosting revenues is unclear, in his view,\" the report said.\n\nDespite questions among experts that AI will meet lofty expectations, some are optimistic about the technology. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, shared a more favourable view of AI in the report.\n\n\"He estimates that gen AI will ultimately automate 25 per cent of all work tasks and raise U.S. productivity by nine per cent and GDP growth by 6.1 per cent cumulatively over the next decade,\" the report said.\n\nBriggs notes that although automating many \"AI-exposed tasks\" is not cost-effective today, he points to the likelihood that costs will drop over the longer term, allowing for more AI automation.\n\nThe report also states Eric Sheridan, a U.S. internet equity research analyst at Goldman Sachs, is still enthusiastic regarding AI's transformative potential, noting that investors are \"rewarding only those companies that can tie a dollar of AI spending back to revenues.\"\n\nPower and chip shortages?\n\nAlso explored in the report, was the possibility that even if AI has the ability to \"generate significant benefits for economies and returns for companies,\" shortages of key inputs like chips and power could prevent the technology from reaching its potential.\n\nThe report cites the opinions of Goldman Sachs U.S. semiconductor analysts Toshiya Hari, Anmol Makkar and David Balaban who state that the number of chips is likely to \"constrain AI growth over the next few years,\" as demand surpasses supply.\n\n\"But the bigger question seems to be whether power supply can keep up,\" the report said.\n\n\"GS (Goldman Sachs) U.S. and European utilities analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolfi, respectively, expect the proliferation of AI technology, and the data centers necessary to feed it, to drive an increase in power demand the likes of which hasn't been seen in a generation.\"\n\nRising power demands from AI pose a challenge for the U.S. power grid, according to Brian Janous, the co-founder of Cloverleaf Infrastructure and former VP of Energy at Microsoft.\n\nThe report notes Janous' position that U.S. utilities are not prepared for the \"coming demand surge\" and the aging U.S. power grid has not seen a rise in electricity consumption in nearly two decades.\n\nAs a result of those constraints, Janous and Davenport say that \"substantial investment\" in U.S. power infrastructure will take a significant amount of time given the \"highly regulated nature of the utilities industry and supply constraints.\" The report says Janous warns that the \"power crunch\" could weigh on AI growth going forward.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [],

The technology can also streamline administrative processes like scheduling, billing and patient management. Further, AI-driven predictive analytics can help with resource allocation.\n\n\"Despite legitimate concerns about generative AI, in five years, healthcare providers will wonder how they ever got along without it, especially for things like transcribing clinical notes and decision support,\" said Dr. Colin Banas, chief medical officer at medication management company DrFirst.\n\nGoing beyond that, AI can improve diagnostics because it can analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, said Bates. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze medical images to detect conditions such as cancer, heart disease or neurological disorders earlier and more accurately than traditional methods.\n\nOne example includes AIdoc, which is helping transform radiology by detecting anomalies in medical imaging with high accuracy.\n\n\"AI has algorithms that can detect cancer in imaging much sooner than what doctors can do now, providing for earlier, less invasive treatment and a higher chance of survival,\" said ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory compliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Imaging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Imaging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "dateEnd": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1142, "textEnd": 1154}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The platform has already been deployed to several generative AI uses-cases in customer enablement, RegTech, productivity improvement and cyber security, McLaren told iTnews' 2023 State of IT report.\n\nHighlighting the whole-of-government group's focus on maximising interoperability and maintaining oversight, QChat was developed, tested and rolled out gradually \"within a few departments\" before access was expanded, QCDG executive director of data and AI Nathan Bines said.\n\nMoreover, all AI projects are already registered with QGCDG, and government bodies use an assurance profiling tool [pdf] to determine whether only an internal assessment is required or an additional external review.\n\nThe details that the new policy will confirm are the level of assurance

The participants also thought about factors such as lagged effects on wages and prices of past monetary policy tightening. Additionally, the delayed response of measured shelter prices to rental market developments, or the prospect of additional supply-side improvements were considered.\n\nHowever, they reasoned that Artificial Intelligence -related technology could also go a long way in mitigating inflation. The application of this innovative technology could bring a significant boost in productivity to businesses and in turn, the economy. Also, the FOMC meeting participants observed that longer-term inflation expectations had remained well anchored.\n\nThis anchoring is viewed as underpinning the process to disinflation. Consequently, there is a core request for additional favorable data. This will serve as an assurance and confidence booster that inflation will head sustainably toward 2%.\n\nHighlighting AI in the search for disinflation factors is an important push for the burgeoning technology niche. It suggest that AI is gradually gaining traction across several sectors and borders. The U.S. government may eventually giving the sector a shot especially as it has been pushing to regulate AI in its region.\n\nIn December 2023, the Biden administration embarked on a venture to revolutionize AI, particularly, its safety, security and trust.

Take our quick AI survey and share your insights on the current state of AI, how you're implementing it, and what you expect to see in the future. Learn More\n\nMeta has thrown down the gauntlet in the race for more efficient artificial intelligence. The tech giant released pre-trained models on Wednesday that leverage a novel multi-token prediction approach, potentially changing how large language models (LLMs) are developed and deployed.\n\nThis new technique, first outlined in a Meta research paper in April, breaks from the traditional method of training LLMs to predict just the next word in a sequence. Instead, Meta's approach tasks models with forecasting multiple future words simultaneously, promising enhanced performance and drastically reduced training times.\n\nThe implications of this breakthrough could be far-reaching. As AI models balloon in size and complexity, their voracious appetite for computational power has raised concerns about cost and environmental impact. Meta's multi-token prediction method might offer a way to curb this trend, making advanced AI more accessible and sustainable.\n\nDemocratizing AI: The promise and perils of efficient language models\n\nThe potential of this new approach extends beyond mere efficiency gains. By predicting multiple tokens at once, these models may develop a more nuanced understanding of language structure and context. This could lead to improvements in tasks ranging from code generation to creative writing, potentially bridging the gap between AI and human-level language understanding.\n\nHowever, the democratization of such powerful AI tools is a double-edged sword. While it could level the playing field for researchers and smaller companies, it also lowers the barrier for potential misuse. The AI community now faces the challenge of developing robust ethical frameworks and security measures that can keep pace with these rapid technological advancements.\n\nMeta's decision to release these models under a non-commercial research license on Hugging Face, a popular platform for AI researchers, aligns with the company's stated commitment to open science. But it's also a strategic move in the increasingly competitive AI landscape, where openness can lead to faster innovation and talent acquisition.\n\nThe initial release focuses on code completion tasks, a choice that reflects the growing market for AI-assisted programming tools. As software development becomes increasingly intertwined with AI, Meta's contribution could accelerate the trend towards human-AI collaborative coding.\n\nThe AI arms race heats up: Meta's strategic play in the tech battlefield\n\nHowever, the release isn't without controversy. Critics argue that more efficient AI models could exacerbate existing concerns about AI-generated misinformation and cyber threats. Meta has attempted to address these issues by emphasizing the research-only nature of the license, but questions remain about how effectively such restrictions can be enforced.\n\nThe multi-token prediction models are part of a larger suite of AI research artifacts released by Meta, including advancements in image-to-text generation and AI-generated speech detection. This comprehensive approach suggests that Meta is positioning itself as a leader across multiple AI domains, not just in language models.\n\nAs the dust settles on this announcement, the AI community is left to grapple with its implications.

It is improving trading strategies, enhancing risk management, boosting customer engagement, and increasing operational efficiency - to name a few. These combined changes are creating a more responsive and efficient market environment. But what does this mean for the future of finance, and how can organizations best leverage AI to stay ahead? Let's explore.\n\nAI-driven algorithms are enhancing trading strategies by providing unprecedented insights and speed. While high-frequency trading (HFT) firms have been using machine learning (ML) algorithms since the early 2000s to predict market trends and price movements, generative AI (GenAI) has taken this further.\n\nPreviously, ML algorithms used extensive datasets of historical price data and trading volumes to identify patterns. Now, with the advent of GenAI, advanced deep learning techniques can uncover data patterns that traditional models might overlook. This technology can also incorporate unstructured data such as news sentiment, social media sentiment, and financial reports into predictive models.\n\nThese enhanced predictions can guide human traders or trigger automated trading decisions based on set thresholds, while also aiming to find unique investment opportunities that yield above-market returns. The most talked-about benefit of this approach is speed and accuracy, but the reduction of emotional biases that often affect human decision-making is equally impactful. This enables a more rational and data-driven approach to trading and investment banking.\n\nMoreover, AI optimizes the execution of large orders by strategically placing them to ensure the best possible prices without causing significant market disruptions - a capability crucial for maintaining market stability and achieving optimal trading outcomes.\n\nAI's ability to monitor and assess market risks in real time significantly enhances risk management strategies. The technology can achieve this by simulating various market scenarios, including extreme events. AI can also stress-test portfolios and identify emerging risks and market manipulation patterns. These capabilities enable a proactive approach, allowing firms to make informed decisions quickly and minimize potential losses.\n\nAnother important aspect is AI's role in detecting fraud. By analyzing vast datasets, AI can identify anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activities, thereby protecting market integrity. Despite these advancements, human oversight is still essential to ensure AI systems function as intended and that final decisions are accountable to experienced professionals.\n\nThrough AI-led hyper-personalization, firms can deliver tailored solutions at the right time, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. For example, banks and financial institutions can revamp their customer service channels, potentially reducing service costs and decreasing the frequency of user-related issues due to a better user interface. AI may also improve accessibility - take voice-activated assistants and intuitive interfaces, for instance. Both features can help the elderly and people with disabilities manage their investments more easily, providing clear, step-by-step guidance better suited to their needs.\n\nAdditionally, firms can provide new training opportunities for products through personalized learning platforms that use AI to assess the individual knowledge levels of users. This way, they can offer tailored educational content that ensures clients receive relevant information and recommendations precisely when they need them. Combining these factors will naturally increase engagement, client satisfaction, and loyalty.\n\nOperational efficiency sees considerable benefits from AI advancements, improving processes traditionally relying on robotic process automation (RPA). AI capabilities lead to increased productivity by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, while also introducing advanced decision-making and learning abilities. For instance, AI can handle complex data interpretation, document processing, and transaction reconciliation, which are essential - but undeniably monotonous - tasks. These tasks also require adaptability to changing information and conditions, areas where GenAI can improve upon the more structured tasks that RPA handles. It's not only about saving time; there's also the element of reducing the likelihood of human error, leading to more accurate and efficient operations.\n\nIt is crucial to make clear that AI's continuous learning capabilities ensure that these automated processes improve over time by learning from new data and continuously refining its algorithms to better detect suspicious activities. This adaptability is crucial in maintaining high operational standards and staying ahead of potential risks.\n\nAddressing the challenges of AI in capital markets\n\nWe have discussed the benefits that the rapid advancement of AI has brought to capital markets, such as improved trading strategies, enhanced risk management, better customer engagement, and increased operational efficiency. Additionally, automating routine tasks allows staff to focus on more complex and strategic work. However, the underlying concern is: How do we address the ethical and regulatory challenges that come with these advancements?\n\nThe answer is multifaceted, but it should always start and end with these principles:\n\n* Ensuring transparency and explainability, with robust model validation frameworks.\n\n* Accountability, human oversight, and established governance processes.\n\n* Continuous monitoring and regular audits to ensure AI systems operate as intended.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in capital markets expands, presenting both new opportunities and new challenges. Balancing innovation with responsible AI practices ensures that the benefits of AI are realized without compromising ethical standards and regulatory compliance.", "source": {"uri": "techcircle.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Techcircle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trading strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High-frequency trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Efficient-market hypothesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_trading_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automated trading system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotic process automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rationality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Value_Based_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Value Based Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://assets.techcircle.in/uploads/article-image/2024/07/images/35005-ryan-cox.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

This is critical, because the Act's obligations relating to high-risk AI systems are determined by the position that the Act assigns to the organisation in the value chain of high-risk AI systems that is created by the Act.\n\nThe concept of a value or supply chain of products, conceived as a series of economic operators occupying different tiers in the sequence by which a product proceeds from manufacturer to end customer, comes from the EU's \"New Legislative Framework\" (NLF) product safety legislation. But the AI Act takes the idea further by placing obligations not just on entities that \"provide\" (and, to a far lesser extent, \"distribute\" or \"import\") high-risk AI systems, but also on those that \"deploy\" them. These two roles, the Provider and the Deployer, are the two most important in the Act.\n\nOnce you determine your role, then the Act sets out your obligations in relation to high-risk AI systems in an apparently tidy way. The obligations on Providers are listed in Article 16, and those for Importers, Distributors and Deployers are set out in Articles 23, 24 and 26 respectively. Much of the rest of the Act is focussed on the obligations of Providers of high-risk AI systems, and establishing a framework for enforcement of the Act.\n\nIn fact the potential roles and responsibilities that can accrue to an organisation under the Act go beyond this orderly set of roles in the AI value chain. And there is another important actor hidden away in Article 25, that of a third party supplier of components of a high-risk AI System, whose responsibilities are less clearly defined, but seem likely to have a wide impact in practice.\n\nMany organisations making use of AI will be Deployers\n\nOrganisations that use high-risk AI systems will be Deployers, so will be the most common type of role created by the Act and we expect will capture many businesses making use of AI. The obligations on Deployers in Article 26 are not trivial. What kind of technical and organisational measures will Deployers have to take to ensure that AI systems are used in accordance with the Provider's instructions of use? What roles will be given over to the human oversight function required by the Act? How will a Deployer ensure that input data is relevant and sufficiently representative? The optimal outcome would be that a combination of guidance from the EU AI Office and harmonised technical standards will provide practical insights to help answer these questions.\n\nComplex AI supply chain means other roles are harder to determine\n\nThe definitions of Provider, Distributor and Importer are all built on the fundamental NLF product safety law concept of the placing on the market of a product, along with the related terms of making available on the market and putting into service. These terms are all defined in the Act, and in many circumstances will be relatively straightforward to apply.\n\nHowever, given Bristows' long experience in advising on these terms in the context of the EU Medical Device Regulation, especially as that legislation applies to Software as a Medical Device, we anticipate that, in many scenarios, applying these terms to AI systems will present considerable practical challenges. This is partly because the terms were originally defined with physical products in mind and the read-across to software is not necessarily intuitive, and partly because the access and distribution channels in the AI product ecosystem (e.g. API, SaaS, closed v open source) are already far more complex than when the Act was conceived and drafted, both technically and in the sense of the underlying legal/contractual relationships.\n\nGuidance on and examples of roles expected to be needed\n\nSurprisingly, there does not appear to be any specific guidance scheduled for publication on this topic by the AI Office. Article 96(1)(e) obliges the Commission to publish detailed guidance on the relationship between the Act and other EU legislation, including product safety legislation. It would be optimal for, at the least, that guidance to include a section on how to interpret placing on the market in the specific context of the AI Act, accompanied by a long list of detailed examples. Similar guidance exists in the form of the EU Commission's Blue Guide, which is the authoritative reference manual used by practitioners to interpret placing on the market and ancillary terms in the context of the EU's NLF product safety legislation.\n\nHowever, the Blue Guide does not consider the specific difficulties associated with interpreting these terms in the context of software and AI, because it is primarily intended for use in relation to tangible products which are manufactured, warehoused, shipped and physically supplied/installed. The Blue Guide also does not address the Deployer role, because that role does not exist in other NLF product safety legislation. AI-specific guidance, which takes into account the intangibility of software and all of the different distribution models which are available for AI systems, would be of great value.\n\nRole of Provider is critical to understand\n\nWhat the Act does usefully do is explain the circumstances in which a Deployer, Importer, Distributor or other third party can become a Provider of a high-risk AI system that is already circulating in the market.\n\nThis is explained in Article 25, which we expect will become one of the most heavily cited (and perhaps contested) provisions of the Act. Given the compliance overhead that will fall on Providers of high-risk AI systems, no organisation will want to become one inadvertently. The fact that putting your name or trade mark on a high-risk AI system that is already on the market is enough for your organisation to be deemed the Provider of that AI system is a key takeaway here.\n\nArticle 25 also introduces another role in the value chain: the supplier of an AI system, tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system. Because it is not neatly defined, and only appears in Article 25(4), this component supplier role has not attracted much attention or commentary, but our view is that it could catch a broad swathe of vendors who otherwise consider themselves out-of-scope of the Act.\n\nThe obligation is for a written contract to be used between Providers of high-risk AI systems and these suppliers to facilitate the Provider's compliance with the Act. The AI Office is to produce a set of voluntary model contractual terms for this purpose.\n\nIt is interesting to consider this in light of the so-called LLM orchestration stack that has emerged over the last 18 months in relation to foundation models, with a variety of highly specialised service providers (e.g. vector databases, open-source LLM platforms) now available to assist in developing a LLM-based product. Given how widely scoped the component supplier role is under Article 25(4), it is easy to see the AI Office's voluntary model terms being very widely adopted if (as seems inevitable) a similar technology/vendor stack develops around high-risk AI systems, or at least some of the more popular use cases.\n\nOverlaps and closing thought\n\nArticle 25 raises the possibility of AI systems developed by a third party, being integrated into a Provider's high-risk AI system. The same is true of general purpose AI models under Article 54, which could be a component of an AI system (whether high-risk or not), or become a standalone high-risk AI system.\n\nSimilarly, the transparency provisions in Article 50 (relating to lifelike interactive AI, deepfake content, etc.) will apply to any AI system that has the relevant functionality, which could be a high-risk AI system and/or a general purpose AI model.\n\nSo, whilst the value chain of Provider, Importer, Distributor and Deployer of high-risk AI systems is still the core set of roles around which the Act is organised, they are not the whole story, and we are only beginning the journey of understanding how to interpret their obligations under the AI Act.\n\nThe good news is that the EU Commission has an obligation under the Act to publish guidelines to assist in interpreting high-risk for the purposes of Annex III. The Act states that these guidelines must include a comprehensive list of practical examples of uses cases that are high-risk and not high-risk. The less good news is that the deadline for publishing the guidelines will be in March 2026 (assuming the Act comes into force in August 2024). This will be just six months before most of the Act will apply as law. Whilst this may be too late for developers of AI systems that do not map neatly onto Annex III, it is possible that the Commission's new AI Office will publish the guidelines earlier, or at least provide informal guidance in webinars and other forums in the meantime, perhaps in the context of the AI Pact initiative.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rules around high-risk AI products and use cases are complex and rarely intuitive, but understanding the principles behind the Act's approach to high-risk AI should help in applying them to your AI system.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viet Cong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Value chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software as a service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stack (abstract data type)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vector graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

McKinsey's research indicated that only 30% of digital transformation initiatives have succeeded. This statistic underscores banks' difficulty demonstrating a return on investment for their tech spending, particularly in AI.\n\nSeveral factors compound these challenges, McKinsey said. Banks must show ROI on past technology investments, differentiate themselves from competitors, and achieve success in ongoing transformation efforts. McKinsey's data showed that higher revenue in banking \"remains very strongly correlated with more manual work,\" suggesting that technology still needs to deliver the expected automation benefits.\n\nThe consulting firm emphasized that capturing value from AI requires actions beyond the technology domain. McKinsey surveys revealed that 60% of executives cited skill gaps as an obstacle in digital transformations, while 70% reported facing fundamental resistance to change.\n\nTo address these challenges, McKinsey advocated for a comprehensive approach. For every dollar invested in technology, an equal amount should be allocated to strategic organizational, cultural and change management initiatives. This approach ensures that AI implementations yield tangible benefits in revenue generation, cost reduction or risk management, providing a sense of reassurance.\n\nAs banks navigate the AI landscape, McKinsey outlined three questions for leaders. First, they must identify areas where AI can generate the most business value. Second, banks need to reallocate spending toward these high-potential areas. Finally, institutions should implement change management strategies that extend beyond the IT department.\n\nWhile AI's transformative potential in banking is clear, McKinsey's insights suggested that success will depend on technological advancements and banks' ability to reshape their organizations to use AI effectively and fundamentally. As financial institutions grapple with these challenges, turning AI's promise into measurable results looms large on the horizon.\n\nSpeaking at the Point Zero Forum in Zurich Tuesday (July 2), Keller-Busse compared the change to how patients now approach doctors with preconceived ideas about their conditions, noting that clients increasingly use AI to generate ideas before presenting them to the bank.\n\n\"In our industry, this will happen as well because with ChatGPT, there is more data available,\" Keller-Busse said, per the report. \"We have to be aware that our clients are using it.\"\n\nUBS has been integrating AI into its client services and products. Last year, the bank launched a pilot program for instant credit aimed at small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which often need quick access to liquidity. The service allows for bypassing credit officers, speeding up the process for this relatively standard product, the report said.\n\nKeller-Busse emphasized that these developments are the start of a broader trend, saying in the report, \"It's just the beginning of what we will see.\"\n\nThe shift reflects a broader trend in the financial services industry, where AI and machine learning transform traditional banking practices. As clients become more tech-savvy and access sophisticated AI tools, banks must adapt their services and client engagement strategies. The change affects how banks interact with their customers and how they develop and offer products and services.\n\nThe integration of AI in banking also raises questions about the future role of human bankers. While AI can streamline processes and provide quick data analysis, human judgment remains crucial, especially in complex financial decisions. Banks like UBS will likely face the challenge of balancing AI capabilities and maintaining the personal touch that many clients still value in their banking relationships.\n\nIn a June report, Citigroup warned that the banking industry faces the most significant impact from AI deployment, with 54% of roles at risk of AI-driven job displacement. Furthermore, an additional 12% of banking jobs could be enhanced by AI integration.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Change management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital transformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consulting_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consulting firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z\u00fcrich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Z\u00fcrich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/banks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 442, "textEnd": 448}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 2695, "textEnd": 2701}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

According to the last Citi Treasury and Trade Solution (TTS) Survey 2024, 93% of the interviewed banks, insurers and asset managers surveyed expected an increase in profitability from the adoption of AI in the next 5 years. Not only does integrating AI make sense from an operational perspective, it may also positively impact a company's bottom line. But how can you go about selecting the right AI FinTech solution provider, which ultimately is going to become critical to leveraging these advanced technologies effectively? This choice requires a comprehensive evaluation of both technical and organisational aspects to ensure the provider aligns with your company's objectives and capabilities.\n\nUnderstanding the Company\n\nThe first step in choosing an AI FinTech solution provider is to gain a deep understanding of the company itself. Investigate the founders' vision and expertise, as these elements often drive the company's strategic direction and potential for innovation. Equally important is the calibre of the investors backing the company, as their support can indicate financial stability and a long-term commitment to the company's success. Ensure also that you understand how long the firm has been established or in the sector before the current hype around generative AI / LLMs.\n\nDelve into the qualifications, experience, and past projects of the AI development team. A team with a strong background in both AI and finance is likely to produce high-quality, innovative solutions. Assess their ability to solve complex problems and their track record in delivering successful projects similar to your needs.\n\nMarket Recognition and Client Relationships\n\nMarket recognition can serve as a valuable indicator of a provider's reliability and reputation. Look for external validations such as industry awards, positive media coverage, and peer recognition. These accolades can provide an unbiased perspective on the company's performance and standing in the FinTech sector.\n\nClient relationships offer another crucial insight. Examine the provider's client portfolio, focusing on clients in similar sectors or with similar use cases. A diverse and reputable client base suggests the provider can adapt to various needs and deliver effective solutions. Client testimonials, case studies, and reviews can provide direct feedback on the provider's performance, reliability, and support quality. Engaging with current or past clients for firsthand insights can further illuminate what you can expect from the provider.\n\nPerformance & Technical Evaluation\n\nA thorough technical evaluation is essential when choosing an AI FinTech solution provider. This step could also require more time.\n\nStart by investigating the provider's historical success in delivering AI solutions. A consistent track record indicates reliability and expertise, especially if alpha-seeking is the focus.\n\nEvaluate the development methodology and AI development cycle, from ideation to deployment. Understanding their approach can help you determine if it aligns with your project requirements and expectations.\n\nAssess the robustness of the AI model development process. Reliable and effective solutions require thorough and rigorous model development. Examine how the provider ensures the accuracy, fairness, and transparency of their AI models. How do they approach explainability? How automated is the model selection (i.e. does it remove human bias)?\n\nConsider the functioning of the AI platform (or solution) and its unique features. Determine how the platform operates and whether it meets your specific needs. The mode of solution delivery -- whether via API, web app, or raw data -- should align with your existing infrastructure to ensure seamless integration and operation. Compatibility with your technical capabilities is crucial for smooth implementation and ongoing use.\n\nAs data is the centre of any AI model, the data research and dataset preparation processes are also critical. Especially for predictive or analytical AI solutions, the quality and the quantity of data directly influence how good the predictive model will be. A bad dataset will produce bad AI results. A well thought out structured dataset will dramatically improve the outcome, and the better the data, the more outstanding the results.\n\nAcademic & research credibility\n\nKeeping up with the innovation surrounding the AI and financial sectors can be a challenge. Therefore, academic connections or close relationships with renowned universities can be a plus. Investigating external publications in respected academic journals, awards recognitions or being mentioned by external research institutions could be a good indication of the credibility of the AI FinTech provider.\n\nOrganisational Alignment and Support\n\nOrganisational alignment is another critical factor. Ensure the provider's core values and culture align with your organisation's values. This alignment fosters a more effective and harmonious partnership built on mutual trust and shared objectives. In the FinTech industry, where trust and transparency are paramount, such alignment can significantly enhance the partnership's success and longevity.\n\nSupport and training are vital for successful integration. Evaluate the level of support and training offered during and after implementation. Adequate training ensures your team can effectively use the AI solutions, while ongoing support addresses any issues that may arise, ensuring continuous improvement and optimal performance.\n\nRegulatory Compliance and Ethical Considerations\n\nLastly, consider the provider's commitment to compliance and ethical AI practices. The regulatory landscape in FinTech is constantly evolving, and adherence to current regulations is crucial to avoid legal issues. Ensure the provider follows ethical standards in AI development, focusing on fairness, transparency, and accountability. This commitment not only protects your company but also reinforces the trustworthiness of the AI solutions implemented.\n\nChoosing the right AI FinTech solution provider is a multifaceted process requiring careful consideration of technical and organisational aspects. By thoroughly evaluating the company's background, market recognition, client relationships, technical capabilities, organisational alignment, support, and regulatory compliance, you can make an informed decision. This strategic choice will enable you to leverage AI effectively, achieve superior investment outcomes, and drive long-term growth.", "source": {"uri": "financialit.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial IT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speech synthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Explainable artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_(computer_science)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robustness (computer science)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Case study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methodology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Israel)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alignment (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predictive modelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory compliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Transformation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Transformation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://financialit.net/sites/default/files/financial_it_blog_1920_x_1080_px_3_11.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Take our quick AI survey and share your insights on the current state of AI, how you're implementing it, and what you expect to see in the future. Learn More\n\nIn just a short period of time, AI has demonstrated viable capabilities in healthcare: Large language models (LLMs) can offer tumor diagnoses, provide sleep and fitness advice, scan medical images and analyze MRIs, X-rays and tissue samples.\n\nFor all its opportunities, though, there are significant -- and valid -- concerns around output accuracy, transparency, integration, data privacy, ethics, bias and regulatory compliance, among others.\n\n\"The integration of AI into healthcare is not just an evolution but a revolution that holds the promise of significantly enhancing patient care, operational efficiency and medical research,\" Timothy Bates, clinical professor of cybersecurity in the College of Innovation and Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told VentureBeat.\n\nBut, he emphasized, \"realizing this potential requires addressing substantial challenges.\"\n\nAI throughout the medical workflow\n\nTo start, AI can take over time-consuming, repetitive tasks such as summarizing appointments (which it has already been shown to do better than humans). The technology can also streamline administrative processes like scheduling, billing and patient management. Further, AI-driven predictive analytics can help with resource allocation.\n\n\"Despite legitimate concerns about generative AI, in five years, healthcare providers will wonder how they ever got along without it, especially for things like transcribing clinical notes and decision support,\" said Dr. Colin Banas, chief medical officer at medication management company DrFirst.\n\nGoing beyond that, AI can improve diagnostics because it can analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, said Bates. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze medical images to detect conditions such as cancer, heart disease or neurological disorders earlier and more accurately than traditional methods.\n\nOne example includes AIdoc, which is helping transform radiology by detecting anomalies in medical imaging with high accuracy.\n\n\"AI has algorithms that can detect cancer in imaging much sooner than what doctors can do now, providing for earlier, less invasive treatment and a higher chance of survival,\" said Baruch Labunski, CEO at SEO company Rank Secure.\n\nAI can also support more personalized medicine through analysis of data such as genetics, lifestyle, medications, conditions and past procedures, Bates pointed out. And, models can remotely monitor wearables that track vital signs and health metrics in real time. \"This is particularly beneficial for managing chronic diseases and providing care in underserved areas.\"\n\nSimilarly, predictive analytics can help foresee patient deterioration, sepsis and other critical conditions, thus allowing for timely interventions. For instance, hospitals are using AI to predict patient readmission risks and accordingly tailor post-discharge care plans, Bates pointed out.\n\nFrom an infrastructure standpoint, predictive analytics can also optimize operations of complex hospital environments, said Bjorn Andersson, senior director for global digital innovation marketing and strategy at Hitachi Vantara. Models could analyze live input from sensors or even external data around weather forecasting to help institutions preposition resources in the case of an impending heatwave or other weather-related event.\n\n\"This combination of physical and cyber is becoming more important as things like weather events become more unpredictable and severe,\" said Andersson.\n\nSupporting drug discovery, clinical trials\n\nAI also has immense potential in research labs, notably around drug discovery and development, experts note.\n\nFor example, researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute have built a machine learning (ML) model that generates more accurate predictions for immune checkpoint inhibitors (drugs that treat cancer). Another example is Google's DeepMind, which has made breakthroughs in protein folding predictions to aid drug discovery.\n\n\"One of the best aspects of using AI in healthcare is in analyzing proposed drug treatments, side effects and how they will likely interact,\" said Labunski.\n\nMeanwhile, in clinical trials, gen AI can pre-screen patients by comparing data from questionnaires against trial requirements, thus increasing the number of qualified participants, said Cara Brant, CEO at patient recruitment platform Clinical Trial Media.\n\n\"This helps reduce cost and time, which both impact how quickly potentially life-changing drugs get to market,\" she said.\n\nConcerns around data privacy, integration, transparency\n\nOn the flip side, two of the most critical concerns around AI use in healthcare settings are data privacy and security.\n\nBates pointed to the \"highly sensitive\" nature of healthcare data, which will require \"robust data protection measures\" with AI use. \"Ensuring patient confidentiality and securing data against breaches is paramount,\" he said.\n\nRegulatory compliance is another biggie, and healthcare institutions must balance data accessibility with stringent privacy regulations such as HIPAA. \"Ensuring compliance with existing regulations while also adapting to new ones can be a daunting task for healthcare providers and technology developers alike,\" said Bates.\n\nFurther, medical institutions can struggle to integrate AI with existing legacy systems, which can lead to interoperability issues. This in turn requires investment in upgrades and staff training. Also when it comes to staff (patients, too) there can be skepticism around the reliability and efficacy of AI, Bates pointed out.\n\n\"AI doesn't share how it arrives at conclusions, and the lack of transparency in that process could pose problems in treatments and even providing care,\" said Labunski.\n\nMuddu Sudhakar, co-founder and CEO at enterprise search company Aisera, agreed that \"models can be complex black boxes with little transparency.\" Also, \"AI is not perfect. It can make mistakes.\"\n\nThus, going forward, Bates noted, it will be important to build trust through transparent processes, rigorous testing and demonstration of tangible benefits.\n\nEnsuring humans continue helping humans\n\nAs the industry increasingly adopts AI and automation, there is a \"significant concern\" that there will be a shift away from people interactions.\n\n\"Healthcare is deeply personal and intimate, which is one of AI's largest limitations,\" she said.\n\nPatients want to work with providers they trust, and the average person may not fully understand what their diagnosis or treatment plan means. They must work hand in hand with another human to understand all the different nuances. \"The healthcare industry is challenged with toeing the line between using AI to optimize processes and reserving some areas of care solely for humans,\" she said.\n\nAI, at least at this point, is a provider from which to \"get a second opinion\" on scans and test results, agreed HP Newquist, executive director at The Relayer Group. AI can analyze a \"data warehouse\" of each patient, and run that against the most up-to-date medical papers and state-of-the-art practices. Data can then be summarized quickly and presented to a doctor along with recommendations.\n\n\"The key word here is 'recommendation' -- AI is not even close to a point where it should be making decisions without human supervision,\" said Newquist.\n\nHe noted that no one doctor can keep up with the flow of new information in their chosen field. However, an LLM fed with daily reports from peer-reviewed journals could quickly recommend the newest perspectives on specific diseases, operations and patient care.\n\n\"For more clinical tasks, 'augmented intelligence' is the sweet spot for healthcare,\" Banas agreed.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taryn_plumb@venturebeat.com", "name": "Taryn Plumb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision support system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_allocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resource allocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug discovery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory compliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hitachi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Computing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Computing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a-visionary-depiction-of-an-ai-in-a-profile-view-d-_ijmJqgJRF28eIScxg4UXQ-uvGyXmwuQFC-Vm7YZEgT5g-transformed.jpeg?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Learn More\n\nGenerative AI was always going to upend search. It's a technology that can find answers to virtually any question posed to it. And in the process of changing the world of search, AI developers latched on to something else that would meld search and generative AI even more.\n\nGenerative AI has changed three essential aspects of search: how people ask and look for information, how to get data for answers and how companies can start offering this information to customers.\n\nFor years, Google has dominated Search. As the dominant search engine (with almost 82% of search traffic), it dictated how users and customers look for information and how brands show up in results. Companies had to lean into search engine optimization (SEO) strategies, and people constructed queries into a keyword salad. It didn't always yield good results, but it was passable, and everyone learned to translate their questions into keywords and interpret which of the lists of websites on the results page might have what they were looking for.\n\nLarge language models (LLM) changed that, especially when deployed in chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. People could suddenly ask any question they wanted (within guardrail reason) and get an answer right back.

The UAE's Technology Innovation Institute announced in May that it had released a new AI model to compete with rival models from big technology companies.\n\nSaudi Arabia has inked a deal with US technology giant IBM to train the kingdom's Arabic large language model 'ALLaM' using IBM's Watsonx AI platform. The Saudi media ministry meanwhile signed an MoU with Microsoft Arabia to integrate AI in local media outlets.\n\nBoth the UAE and Saudi Arabia have ambitious goals to diversify their economies away from depending on energy revenues, with investment in digital transformation, particularly AI, a key part of the strategy.\n\n\"AI is not just a buzzword anymore, it is becoming a reality, one that is very important to the MENA region's future,\" Nermine El Saadany, regional vice-president for the Middle East at US-based non-profit organisation the Internet Society, told The New Arab.\n\nOther key developments include the UAE in March establishing the AI-focused technology investment firm MGX, which aims to build up assets worth more than $100 billion in the next few years.\n\nIn April, Microsoft announced it was investing $1.5 billion in G42, one of MGX's founding partners, as part of a deal between the Emirati company and the US government to divest from Chinese technology in favour of US technology. The UAE's state minister for AI, Omar Sultan Al Olama, told Reuters in May that the UAE and the US would invest more in AI as part of a strategic partnership.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia announced in March that it plans to set up a $40 billion fund to invest in AI. The project reportedly involved talks between Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz as well as other financiers.\n\nIf implemented, the fund would make the kingdom the world's largest investor in AI. The Financial Times reported in May that a Saudi fund has participated in a $400m investment round in Zhipu AI, a prominent Chinese generative AI start-up.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE are not the only regional countries that have invested in AI. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani announced in May that his country has adopted $2.5 billion in incentives for programs on AI, technology and innovation. Egypt meanwhile has partnered with Italy to establish an AI centre in Cairo.\n\nAs both Saudi Arabia and the UAE compete to take a leading position in AI at a global level, these announcements are bound to have a significant impact on the wider digital ecosystem in the region.\n\n\"This surge in investment could position the UAE and Saudi Arabia as major players in the global AI landscape, fostering innovation and attracting talent from across the MENA region,\" Mohammed Soliman, director of the Strategic Technologies and Cyber Security Program at the Middle East Institute (MEI) in Washington, DC, told The New Arab.\n\nIndeed, such investments could boost the MENA region's overall standing as a tech destination and help transform its status from mainly a technology consumer to a technology innovator.\n\nConsultancy PwC has estimated that AI could contribute $320 billion to the MENA region's economy by 2030, with $135.2 billion in Saudi Arabia alone. All this comes against the backdrop of the United States and China remaining the dominant players in the AI space.\n\nHowever, any long-term push into AI would necessitate a focus on attracting and creating more tech talent. \"Both countries will need to invest in education and training programs to cultivate a strong pool of AI engineers, data scientists, and other specialists,\" says Soliman.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE have launched various programs to teach Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills from a young age. According to data from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the two Gulf states have made progress when it comes to improving basic, intermediate, and advanced digital skills.\n\nHowever, studies indicate that a shortage of talent remains a barrier to technology adoption in both countries. A 2023 survey by cybersecurity company Kaspersky showed that 62% of employees in Saudi Arabia feel the need for better digital skills in their work with computers and other digital equipment, with 45% afraid of losing their jobs due to a lack of IT competencies.\n\nA 2023 study by US software company ServiceNow found that around half of workers surveyed in the UAE (54%) said their formal education did not prepare them for today's working world. Half of the firms surveyed in the UAE as part of the 2022 Hays GCC Salary Guide said their biggest challenge when recruiting staff was a shortage of suitable candidates in areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and cloud engineers.\n\n\"AI could contribute $320 billion to the MENA region's economy by 2030, with $135.2 billion in Saudi Arabia alone\"\n\nHowever, the wider MENA region has a large pool of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates. Several MENA countries according to research by fDi Intelligence in 2023 were among the top 20 geographies in the world with the highest proportion of STEM tertiary graduates, including Oman (39.5%), Iran (39%) and Tunisia (37.9%).\n\nSuch countries could benefit from the Saudi and Emirati push into AI by providing the necessary talent. For instance, El Saadany told The New Arab that the ICT talent pool of Egypt, one of the region's key start-up ecosystems, \"is huge and diversified\" and could be \"very helpful to both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their AI endeavours\".\n\nKnock-on effects for the wider region from the Emirati and Saudi AI funding push could include investments in AI-related businesses elsewhere in the region and the movement of talent in the form of skilled individuals and companies to Saudi Arabia or the UAE.\n\nBut amidst global competition for ICT jobs further investments in training are required as many STEM graduates in the MENA region do not have the skills actually needed for today's job market, as observed by a 2022 UNESCO report.\n\nThe authors highlighted expanding partnerships with the private sector as a way to improve the quality of education. An example of such an initiative can be found in Jordan, where the country's Information and Communications Technology Association (int@j) has been facilitating remedial skills training via boot camps for university graduates.\n\nFor Saudi Arabia and the UAE to benefit from their pledged AI investments in a sustainable way, they must also address other challenges including \"data privacy concerns, data governance frameworks, and potentially collaborate on regional data-sharing initiatives,\" MEI's Soliman says.\n\nEl Saadany of the Internet Society sees a focus on reviewing existing regulation, potentially with outside help, as particularly important. This should not only include regulation directly referring to AI, but also areas such as cloud computing, which is fundamentally changing the access to and location of data, content, and services, El Saadany adds.\n\nAnother challenge stems from the ongoing trade war in the semiconductor industry between China and the US. Various MENA countries, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have signed deals with both Chinese and US companies to drive their digital transformation. However, as tensions between Washington, DC, and Beijing intensify, additional pressure from either side could threaten this diversification strategy.\n\nAt a time when investments in MENA start-ups are in flux, big-ticket announcements on AI emanating from the Gulf could provide a lifeline to revitalise the MENA digital ecosystem. The MENA region's talent pool will play a key role in the success or failure of the Gulf's AI endeavours.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors":

India should not just participate but steer the ongoing AI revolution, and mobilise the powerful technology to bring the nation to the forefront of the global stage, the country's G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant said on Thursday. \"We're truly in a unique moment with the ongoing AI revolution. Its relentless advancing capabilities across the board, its increasing adoption by citizens, and most importantly, its potential to redefine the very fabric of industry and society marks this as a transformative era,\" the former NITI Aayog CEO said at the Global IndiaAI Summit here.\n\nCiting industry body nasscom, Kant said 70 per cent of Indian startups prioritise AI to drive their growth, thus underscoring the critical role of AI in the startup ecosystem.\n\n\"India proudly holds the position of having the second highest number of GitHub AI projects globally, accounting for 19 per cent of worldwide AI projects. this demonstrates a vibrant and active engagement in AI development on an international scale.\n\n\"As we embrace this revolution, the question before us is not merely how we can participate but how we can lead the world. It is our opportunity and indeed our responsibility to harness this powerful technology to propel Indian companies to the forefront of the global stage,\" he said.\n\nKant, 68, said this is a moment to redefine what it means to be a leader and demonstrate that Indian startup enterprises are not just participants in this revolution, but are driving it with vigour, and vision.\n\n\"For me, strategic integration, AI-led data analytics, core R&D, ethics and governance are critical. Just as the first industrial revolution gave birth to various industries with the introduction of the steam engine, AI has the potential to revolutionise multiple sectors in India,\" he said.\n\nEstablishing AI integration across sectors like healthcare, logistics, agriculture, and FMCG is akin to laying down the foundational infrastructure of the steam-based power industry, he said.\n\n\"In healthcare, AI can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care efficiency, directly impacting patient outcome and healthcare delivery,\" Kant said.\n\nHe went on to elaborate on how AI can help transform logistics by streamlining supply chain operations and said rather than adopting a generalised approach, the key lies in developing customised AI solutions tailored to meet the specific needs of each sector.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of these AI applications, Kant said, it is important to analyse the objectives of enterprises and align them with AI capabilities.\n\nTo maintain a competitive edge globally, Indian businesses must fully leverage the stack of AI-driven data, he said.\n\nOn the government's procurement of 10,000 GPUs within the next 18-24 months, Kant said it is a strategic investment that will dramatically boost India's processing power, aligning its resources with its data generation capabilities.\n\n\"It is imperative that Indian enterprises do not merely consume at the frontier of productivity, we must lead it. We are presented with a defining opportunity that arises only once in a generation,\" Kant stressed.\n\nThe AI revolution confronts us with its own set of challenges, including biases, data security, and ethical use, he said.\n\nKant further said a proactive approach is essential for shaping a future where AI is trusted and ethical.", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETTelecom.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "G20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherpa people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Kant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amitabh Kant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immanuel Kant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NITI_Aayog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NITI Aayog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steam engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-moving_consumer_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast-moving consumer goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-111494148,imgsize-113928,width-1200,height=765,overlay-ettelecom/internet/india-must-lead-ai-revolution-not-just-participate-g20-sherpa-amitabh-kant.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

At the heart of developing these capabilities is strategic self-awareness. To change and grow, we must first understand ourselves and the impact of our behaviors on those around us. This is easier said than done.\n\nScientific studies demonstrate a clear relationship between strategic self-awareness and increased leadership performance. Unfortunately, only 10% of leaders accurately recognize how they need to improve. Here's why:\n\nIf leaders are to build the cultures needed to maintain a competitive advantage in the AI Age, we need to be more proactive about giving and receiving feedback. Fortunately, this same technology can make the process easier, more effective, and less painful. Informed by the science of behavior change, AI is proving itself as a useful tool to raise a leader's level of strategic self-awareness and most importantly, turn that newfound awareness into lasting change.\n\nHere are three ways you can use AI to become a more self-aware leader:\n\nWe're often told to play to our strengths but the science shows that this advice is more wrong than right. The more we rely on our strengths, the more prone we are to the \"too much of a good thing\" effect. For instance, if you're a disciplined and organized leader, you will likely become rigid and inflexible. Similarly, you're likely to become domineering and overbearing if you're a driven and competitive leader. Rather than doubling down on our strengths, we should identify how the behaviors that help us ultimately become areas of risk and ineffectiveness. Scientific talent assessments are the first step in pinpointing these gaps. As the adage goes, you can't manage what you don't measure.\n\nPsychometric leadership assessments have been available for decades and are a proven tool to establish a data-driven and empirical baseline for pinpointing areas for development. Yet most scientific tools are expensive and unscalable. Fortunately, artificial intelligence is creating assessments that accurately assess a leader's core drivers and characteristics in a fraction of the time and cost (you can try one for yourself here). The result? AI enables organizations to help leaders and the entire workforce get the data they need to develop the most relevant soft skills and competencies.\n\nTraditional development plans often fall short due to their one-size-fits-all approach and lack of personalization. They are typically static, failing to adapt to the unique needs and evolving goals of individual leaders. With generative AI tools, every leader can now create personal development playbooks that evolve in real-time and are tailored to whatever challenges they may be facing with their team. This adaptive approach ensures that leaders receive the right resources and support exactly when they need it, fostering continuous growth and improvement.\n\nLike training to run a marathon, developing new behaviors that mitigate our risks takes perseverance and focus. While the former is dependent on our willpower, the latter can be aided by AI. Studies have shown that personalized feedback and targeted strategies are most effective in modifying behavior and fostering new habits. The idea of an AI coach may seem strange, but if you haven't already tried, start by experimenting with generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude. Try setting yourself specific, measurable goals and asking it to generate a 90-day plan. Is it better than the feedback you got on your last performance review? Probably!\n\nLeadership does not happen in a vacuum. Successful leaders are defined not only by their individual characteristics but also by the qualities of their followers. A leader's goal is to learn how to adapt their style to meet the needs of their team and find ways to leverage its cognitive diversity. Fortunately, advancements in AI can help here, too. By democratizing access to assessments and coaching tools, AI can help leaders build a strong culture of feedback for their teams -- proven to drive performance.\n\nAI-enabled tools and data-driven assessments only go so far in building great cultures. Organizations are defined by their people, not their technology. Leaders must work to nurture a climate of psychological safety where people feel they can share ideas or mistakes without ridicule or punishment. This involves leaders staying mindful of certain behaviors such as using curiosity to break down defensiveness, treating errors as opportunities for learning, and creating space for individuals to try new approaches. Self-awareness is central to role modeling these behaviors and showing your team how it's done.\n\nIn the AI age, organizations' ultimate competitive advantage will be their ability to adapt and innovate continuously. Self-awareness is not a luxury; it's a necessity. Leaders must cultivate environments where feedback is a constant dialogue, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and mutual understanding. Only then can we harness AI's full potential to augment human ingenuity and drive organizational success.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Self-awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamwork", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teamwork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empirical evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft skills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_mechanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defence mechanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger_Management", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Lifestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6685b89034ecc1ab293dd4ba/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Could a similar analogy be made about the role of data protection governance frameworks as a model for shaping AI governance? Does data protection feel as if it might be a perfect fit for shaping AI governance, and actually isn't?\n\nReasons to be cheerful (\"DP governance = AI governance\")\n\nThere is a school of thought that for effective AI governance, organisations could do worse than start with the data protection governance frameworks that many, particularly in Europe, already have in place. Here are some of the reasons we commonly hear in favour of this:\n\nWhere are the limits to the arguments above? How well do they withstand scrutiny?\n\nThe primary purpose of the Act is to prevent risks caused by \"high-risk\" AI systems (read 'Is my AI \"high-risk\" under the AI Act?' article). For that reason, we confine ourselves below to assessing only how high-risk AI systems measure up against these arguments.\n\nAt the heart of the AI Act is the Title III regime, which governs AI systems that are deemed to pose a \"high-risk\" as Recital 43 and Article 7(2) make clear, to \"health, safety and fundamental rights\". As noted in this series (see 'What is my role under the AI Act?' article), the twin pillars of the Act's approach to its concept of \"high-risk\" AI systems are, on the one hand, the health and safety of individuals, and on the other, the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals as enshrined in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nThis regime is based on a common EU approach, which has been around for decades, to regulate products where safety is of particular importance - medical devices and lifts to name two examples.\n\nUnder this approach, the manufacturer must establish the safety of regulated products through conformity assessments of the products against certain essential statutory requirements. This must be done before the products can be placed on the market (first commercialised). Thereafter, products may be marked \"CE\", allowing their marketing and distribution across the EU. However, it should be stressed that this is not the end of the process, and such products are subject to continuous monitoring and vigilance obligations.\n\nProviders of high-risk AI systems, on whom most of the AI Act's essential requirements fall (see Chapter 2 of the Act), must create and operate a quality management system for the AI systems they have developed. The Act's requirements for the quality management system are set out in Article 9.\n\nIf this regime sounds hardly like the legislative regime for data protection in the EU at all, that is because it is not. There is little similarity between these core features of the Act in relation to high-risk AI systems and the EU legislative approach to data protection as embodied in the GDPR.\n\nDelving further, conformity assessment as a regulatory model depends on standardisation organisations and notified bodies for its efficacy. Broadly, providers that follow a standard developed by one of the European Standardisation Organisations do not need to interpret the essential requirements of the legislation but will instead simply be able to follow the relevant standard. The capacity problems in the EU's system of regulation for this approach are ably described in the following article, but that is another matter. The GDPR's attempt to kickstart a market in mechanisms loosely akin to such standards, that is, certification schemes, certification bodies, and codes of conduct for data protection has been one of its notable failures. Six years on from GDPR implementation, the rate of adoption by data controllers of such certification schemes and codes of conduct remains underwhelming and undoubtedly a disappointment to policymakers and market participants alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo why is the school of thought advocating data protection governance as a model for AI systems governance getting the traction it is? Notwithstanding its shaky assumptions about the legislative scheme of the AI Act (i.e. very different to that of the GDPR), it seems that, at a high level at least, some aspects of governance programmes probably do reflect business processes that do not change that much whatever their subject matter. It seems that, for now at least, organisations are quick to see the opportunity to increase the return on investment in frameworks that they have already developed (for GDPR) by recycling them for AI systems:", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_management_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality management system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Certification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Code of conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Those moves include export curbs targeting mainland tech companies and foreign investment restrictions on hi-tech industries.\n\nDespite the challenges, Kingsoft Cloud\u2019s He said China still leads in the \u201clast milestone\u201d that involves applying AI technology in workflows in the real world. He saw potential in leveraging AI tools in highly data-based, workflow-based and rule-based working environments, as well as scenarios where the output can be clearly defined and measured.\n\nHe listed the healthcare, auditing and financial services sectors as examples where AI can be an important tool.\n\nSenseTime\u2019s Tseng said AI can help free workers from some tedious tasks, citing the virtual assistants powered by the company\u2019s large language models that are used in Hong Kong by major banks, including the Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\n\n\u201cThose repetitive, less-value work, we can outsource to AI, [so that] we can spare humans to do much more intelligent, creative critical decision-making,\u201d Tseng said. \u201cAnd this is how I see where AI could be truly instrumental.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SenseTime", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SenseTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Morning_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South China Morning Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_Commercial_Bank_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial and Commercial Bank of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/04/abe93a0f-03e1-47cd-8931-cd0c49267a1c_923ac570.jpg?itok=UFiXW4vs", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

If you missed it or want to revisit the key points, read through the event summary below, which includes both a recap and a list of specific AI tools discussed.\n\nThe session opened with moderator Marc Faddoul from AI Forensics, who underscored the ubiquitous role of AI in both our personal and professional spheres. He pointed out the need to consider not only the misuse of AI for disinformation and other harmful activities but also its potential to assist individuals and organizations.\n\nKate\u0159ina Anna Magnna from Microsoft introduced the latest AI tools and platforms developed by Microsoft to aid civil society initiatives. She stressed the importance of mastering these tools to enhance efficiency, noting that tasks that once took an hour can now be completed in seconds with AI. She noted that this technology is beneficial for organizations of all sizes, enabling them to automate routine tasks, generate actionable insights from data, streamline decision-making, engage more effectively with stakeholders, and enhance security measures.\n\nMicrosoft also recognizes the resource constraints faced by NGOs, particularly those with limited budgets and staffing. To address this, they have rolled out a series of trainings, tools, and hubs to help NGOs effectively utilize AI. All of these are listed below in detail. Kate\u0159ina also mentioned that Microsoft has special rates for NGOs and reduced prices and licenses. She noted too that in case of questions or suggestions, NGOs can contact Microsoft directly either via its \"Nonprofit Community\" or philanthropies team.\n\nOgnjan Denkovski from Democracy Reporting International (DRI) shared how DRI applies AI in their work, providing a practical example that could be replicated by other civil society organizations. He discussed their use of AI tools for topic modeling, analyzing the toxicity of online content, machine translation, and early detection of technologies that could be used for disinformation. All are detailed further in the list below.\n\nOgnjan also explored DRI's recent monitoring of the European Parliament elections, applying topic modeling and toxicity analysis across eight countries and generating an aggregated toxicity score. Their findings, available online, highlight the prevalence of toxic language in the discourse.\n\nHe also referenced a less recent project, Disinfo Radar, using AI tools developed in-house to assess the potential impacts of emerging tech tools on disinformation at an early stage. The toolset developed automates the collection and analysis of data from electronic preprint repositories (arXiv), industry papers (syncedreview.com), and policy publications (IEEE), creating clusters of tech-related topics and calculating disinformation-potential scores based on dataset mentions.\n\nPaola G\u00e1lvez Callirgos, a Global Independent Consultant in Tech Policy & AI Governance, shared insights on leveraging AI tools to enhance CSO operations. She outlined strategies for using AI to enhance fundraising efforts, boost creative capacities, clearly communicate program impacts, and strengthen community connections.\n\nPaola highlighted a key issue in fundraising: its highly transactional nature, which often discourages repeat donations. This has led to a reactionary approach in CSO operations, where the urgency in communication contributes to high burnout rates among development staff while donor retention remains low. This dynamic, she noted, is damaging the sector. However, Paola stressed that AI holds tremendous potential to revolutionize fundraising, creating a more meaningful interaction for every stakeholder involved and ensuring the sustainability of the relationships that organizations value most. Tools like Fundraising.ai are pivotal, as they can predict who is likely to donate within the next 12 months and identify donors that might not be suitable for contact.\n\nPaola also pointed out the critical role of data and the ability to analyze it swiftly.

Notably, Canadian respondents ranked technology illiteracy as a top talent issue, which also ranked second among global executives.\n\nIn addition, more than half (58 per cent) of Canadian executives reported investing in reskilling internally as opposed to hiring from outside (43 per cent). This is why employees should continually have career progression discussions with their employers and come up with their own professional development learning plan, adds Ho.\n\nIn terms of reskilling and upskilling, AI itself is going to become a skill and competency for people in many different industries. However, they'll need to be an expert in their field, first and foremost, so they understand how AI can be integrated into their field.\n\nRead: Canadian employees have mixed emotions about impact of AI on career, skills: survey\n\n\"For instance, I'm a professor in career development so a big part of that is helping students by incorporating AI in my teaching and learning. Instead of fearing it [and worrying whether] students are plagiarizing using AI, I want to show them how to ethically use [it] as a tool. It's not only helping me develop my competencies, but it's helping to show students what it's like to leverage AI in their future at work.\"\n\nThere are also many ways job seekers can use AI tools to help them find the right job, says Ho. AI tools such as 'job scan' allow people to upload a copy of the job posting and their resume and then it gives a percentage out of 100 regarding how well the resume matches the job description.\n\n\"Look back at the last year and consider some of the hot topics at work that you were curious about and then see if there's alignment with professional development and upskilling. The idea is to make a case the employer can't refuse because they know it's good for your growth and good for the organization.\"\n\nRead: Canadian companies adopting 'stay interviews' as workers rethink careers, needs", "source": {"uri": "benefitscanada.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Benefits Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sadie_janes@benefitscanada.com", "name": "Sadie Janes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Telecommuting", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.benefitscanada.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/04/GBP-report.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

They spend much of their time communicating with colleagues, a laborious activity that is being automated with voice and image generators. Sometimes they must make difficult decisions - and who is better at being dispassionate than a machine?\n\nFinally, these jobs are very well paid, which means the cost savings of eliminating them is considerable.\n\nThe CEO is increasingly imperiled by AI, just like the writer of news releases and the customer service representative. Dark factories, which are entirely automated, may soon have a counterpart at the top of the corporation: dark suites.\n\nThis is not just a prediction. A few successful companies have begun to publicly experiment with the notion of an AI leader, even if at the moment it might largely be a branding exercise.\n\nAI has been hyped as the solution to all corporate problems for about 18 months now, ever since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in November 2022. Silicon Valley put US$29bil (RM136.12bil) last year into generative AI and is selling it hard. Even in its current rudimentary form, AI that mimics human reasoning is finding a foothold among distressed companies with little to lose and lacking strong leadership.\n\n\"In struggling companies, you'll be replacing operational management first but probably keep a few humans to think beyond the machines,\" said Saul J. Berman, a former senior consulting partner with IBM. Overall, he said, \"the change delivered by AI in corporations will be as great or greater at the higher strategic levels of management as the lower ranks.\"\n\nCEOs themselves seem enthusiastic about the prospect - or maybe just fatalistic.\n\nEdX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is now a part of publicly traded 2U Inc, surveyed hundreds of CEOs and other executives last summer about the issue. Respondents were invited to take part and given what edX called \"a small monetary incentive\" to do so.\n\nThe response was striking. Nearly half - 47% - of the executives surveyed said they believed \"most\" or \"all\" of the CEO role should be completely automated or replaced by AI. Even executives believe executives are superfluous in the late digital age.\n\nWhen Anant Agarwal, the founder of edX and a former director of MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab, first saw the 47%, his initial response was that the executives should be saying something else entirely.\n\n\"My first instinct is they would say, 'Replace all the employees but not me',\" he said. \"But I thought more deeply and would say 80% of the work that a CEO does can be replaced by AI.\"\n\nThat includes writing, synthesising, exhorting the employees. More subtly, AI - if it reaches any of the levels its salespeople are promising - will democratise the job of top management even while scaling it back.\n\n\"There used to be a curve of people who were good with numerical skills and those who were not,\" Agarwal said. \"Then the calculator came along and was the great equaliser. I believe AI will do the same thing for literacy. Everybody could be CEO.\"\n\nWorking for the robots has been a long time coming, at least in the realm of popular culture. Perhaps the first use of the phrase \"robot-boss\" was in 1939 in a story by David C. Cooke in a pulp magazine called simply Science Fiction. It was not an empowering tale of mentorship and mutual support.\n\n\"Remember,\" the robot-boss says, \"my photon gun will shoot faster than you can run, so don't try to get away.\"\n\nMany science fiction stories and movies followed that portrayed the human-machine relationship in an equally dark light. Nevertheless, real people seemed to perversely warm to the idea. In a 2017 survey of 1,000 British workers commissioned by an online accounting firm, 42% said they would be \"comfortable\" taking orders from a computer.\n\nLong before the current AI boom, Jack Ma, then the CEO of Chinese ecommerce company Alibaba, predicted that in 30 years \"a robot will likely be on the cover of Time magazine as the best CEO\". He pointed out that robots were quicker and more rational than humans, and were not driven by emotions like anger.\n\nChinese online game company NetDragon Websoft, which has 5,000 employees, appointed what it calls an \"AI-driven rotating CEO\" named Tang Yu in 2022. \"We believe AI is the future of corporate management,\" said the company's founder, Dejian Liu, adding that it was part of NetDragon's move into the \"metaverse-based working community\".\n\nTang Yu, who is personified as a woman, does not appear on an online chart of NetDragon's management team, but the company announced last month that she had won \"the coveted title of 'China's Best Virtual Employee of the Year'\" at the China Digital Human Industry Forum. Another executive picked up the award for her. NetDragon's AI employee team is in charge of performance evaluations and mentoring, among other duties, the company says.\n\nOn the other side of the world, upscale Polish rum company Dictador announced in November that it had an AI humanoid CEO, Mika. She proclaimed on LinkedIn that she was \"devoid of personal bias, ensuring unbiased and strategic choices that prioritise the organisation's best interests\".\n\nExecutives with the National Association of Chief Executive Officers might have something to say about this trend - if only to deny it - but its website does not list any actual human beings affiliated with the group. A message sent through a \"contact us\" prompt received no reply.\n\nAI experts, the human kind, cautioned that we are still at the beginning of any transition but said this is a natural progression.\n\n\"We've always outsourced effort. Now we're outsourcing intelligence,\" said Vinay Menon, who leads the global AI practice at the consultant Korn Ferry. He warned that \"while you may not need the same number of leaders, you will still need leadership\".\n\nFor one thing, humans provide accountability in a way that machines do not. \"AI may be exploited by some as a way to shield folks from having to take fiduciary responsibility,\" said Sean Earley, a managing director of the executive consulting firm Teneo. \"At what point does it become culpable for a mistake?\"\n\n\"Never\" was the position one company took in court recently. A customer brought a case against Air Canada for declining to give the bereavement fare reduction that a chatbot on the airline's site had promised. The customer took his complaint to a small claims tribunal. Air Canada argued in its defense that it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants or representatives - including a chatbot.\n\nThe judge ruled against the airline and in favour of the passenger in February, but the specter of a company's arguing that its own AI could not be trusted did not bode well for AI management teams. Air Canada declined to comment.\n\nMuch of the discussion over the past year about AI in the workplace has revolved around how rank-and-file employees are at risk unless they incorporate new technology into their jobs - without, of course, letting their jobs become AI. Automation historically puts workers at risk even as it benefits investors and managers.\n\nNow the tables are turned. Researchers speculate that automation on the executive level could even help lower-level workers.\n\n\"Someone who is already quite advanced in their career and is already fairly self-motivated may not need a human boss anymore,\" said Phoebe V. Moore, professor of management and the futures of work at the University of Essex Business School. \"In that case, software for self-management can even enhance worker agency.\"\n\nThe pandemic prepared people for this. Many office workers worked from home in 2020, and quite a few still do, at least several days a week. Communication with colleagues and executives is done through machines. It's just a small step to communicating with a machine that doesn't have a person at the other end of it.\n\n\"Some people like the social aspects of having a human boss,\" Moore said. \"But after Covid, many are also fine with not having one.\" - The New York Times", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Take our quick AI survey and share your insights on the current state of AI, how you're implementing it, and what you expect to see in the future. Learn More\n\nAI delivers innovation at a rate and pace the world has never experienced. However, there is a caveat, as the resources required to store and compute data in the age of AI could potentially exceed availability.\n\nThe challenge of applying AI at scale is one that the industry has been grappling with in different ways for some time. As large language models (LLMs) have grown, so too have both the training and inference requirements at scale. Added to that are concerns about GPU AI accelerator availability as demand has outpaced expectations.\n\nThe race is now on to scale AI workloads while controlling infrastructure costs. Both conventional infrastructure providers and an emerging wave of alternative infrastructure providers are actively pursuing efforts to increase the performance of processing AI workloads while reducing costs, energy consumption, and the environmental impact to meet the rapidly growing needs of enterprises scaling AI workloads.\n\n\"We see many complexities that will come with the scaling of AI,\" Daniel Newman, CEO at The Futurum Group, told VentureBeat. \"Some with more immediate effect and others that will likely have a substantial impact down the line.\"\n\nNewman's concerns involve the availability of power as well as the actual long-term impact on business growth and productivity.\n\nIs Quantum Computing a solution for AI scaling?\n\nWhile one solution to the power issue is to build more power generation capacity, there are many other options. Among them is integrating other types of non-traditional computing platforms, such as Quantum computing.\n\n\"Current AI systems are still being explored at a rapid pace and their progress can be limited by factors such as energy consumption, long processing times, and high compute power demands,\" Jamie Garcia, director of Quantum Algorithms and Partnerships at IBM told VentureBeat. \"As quantum computing advances in scale, quality, and speed to open new and classically inaccessible computational spaces, it could hold the potential to help AI process certain types of data.\"\n\nGarcia noted that IBM has a very clear path to scaling quantum systems in a way that will deliver both scientific and business value to users. As quantum computers scale, he said they will have increasing capabilities to process incredibly complicated datasets.\n\n\"This gives them the natural potential to accelerate AI applications that require generating complex correlations in data, such as uncovering patterns that could reduce the training time of LLMs,\" Garcia said. \"This could benefit applications across a wide range of industries, including healthcare and life sciences; finance, logistics and materials science.\"\n\nAI scaling in the cloud is under control (for now)\n\nAI scaling, much like any other type of technology scaling is dependent on infrastructure.\n\n\"You can't do anything else unless you go up from the infrastructure stack,\" Paul Roberts, director of Strategic Account at AWS, told VentureBeat.\n\nRoberts noted that there was a big explosion of gen AI that got started in late 2022 when ChatGPT first went public. While in 2022 it might not have been clear where the technology was headed, he said that in 2024 AWS has its hands around the problem very well. AWS in particular has invested significantly in infrastructure, partnerships and development to help enable and support AI at scale.\n\nRoberts suggests that AI scaling is in some respects a continuation of the technological progress that enabled the rise of cloud computing.\n\n\"Where we are today I think we have the tooling, the infrastructure and directionally I don't see this as a hype cycle,\" Roberts said. I think this is just a continued evolution on the path, perhaps starting from when mobile devices really became truly smart, but today we're now building these models on the path to AGI, where we're going to be augmenting human capabilities in the future.\"\n\nAI scaling isn't just about training, it's also about inference\n\nKirk Bresniker, Hewlett Packard Labs Chief Architect, HPE Fellow/VP has numerous concerns about the current trajectory of AI scaling.\n\nBresniker sees a potential risk of a \"hard ceiling\" on AI advancement if concerns are left unchecked. He noted that given what it takes to train a leading LLM today, if the current processes remain the same he expects that by the end of the decade, more resources would be required to train a single model than the IT industry can likely support.\n\n\"We are heading towards a very, very hard ceiling if we continue current course and speed,\" Bresniker told VentureBeat. \"That's frightening because we have other computational goals we need to achieve as a species other than to train one model one time.\"\n\nThe resources required to train increasingly bigger LLMs isn't the only issue. Bresniker noted that after an LLM is created, the inference is continuously run on them and when that is running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the energy consumption is massive\n\n\"What's going to kill the polar bears is inference,\" Bresniker said.\n\nHow deductive reasoning might help with AI scaling\n\nAccording to Bresniker, one potential way to improve AI scaling is to include deductive reasoning capabilities, in addition to the current focus on inductive reasoning.\n\nBresniker argues that deductive reasoning could potentially be more energy-efficient than the current inductive reasoning approaches, which require assembling massive amounts of information, and then analyzing it to inductively reason over the data to find the pattern. In contrast, deductive reasoning takes a logic-based approach to infer conclusions. Bresniker noted that deductive reasoning is another faculty that humans have, that isn't yet really present in AI. He doesn't think that deductive reasoning should entirely replace inductive reasoning, but rather that it is used as a complementary approach.\n\n\"Adding that second capability means we're attacking a problem in the right way,\" Bresniker said. \"It's as simple as the right tool for the right job.\"\n\nLearn more about the challenges and opportunities for scaling AI at VentureBeat Transform next week.

Over the years, AI has experienced many changes and has gone through interesting advancements that have had an impact on various industries. One industry that has truly changed since the introduction of AI is the online gaming industry. Players all over the world are now able to engage with games on a whole new level, completely surpassing normal expectations.\n\nThis article aims to shed light on the various ways AI has had an impact on the online gaming industry and what these changes mean for players.\n\nDynamic Reactions\n\nOne of the most interesting things about playing online games that feature exceptional AI tools is that there are clever NPCs (Non-Player Characters) embedded into the game, which makes the game more realistic and adds many levels of depth to the game.\n\nThe reason NPCs have been so crucial in the development of games is that they create a far more interesting field for actual players to engage with. Picture this: you're playing your favorite online game like this one and suddenly you stumble upon different characters in a game. You engage with them and are able to have full-on conversations with them, they may even remember you from a few days ago when you first met them, reacting in a manner very similar to how a human would react. This creates a far more realistic and integrated experience than ever before and NPCs are only possible thanks to AI. Therefore, AI has truly had a large and positive impact on the way that players engage with online games.\n\nIntelligent Enemy Behaviours\n\nAnother AI trend that has made online games the fad and popular item that they are today is the fact that the systems operating in the back of programs, the AI, are also able to establish enemy behaviors. So, if you're playing an online game like GTA or Dota for example, chances are you're going to run into some characters who do not want the best for your avatar. In old games, if you did not follow the console's instructions, you would just linger next to the enemy and nothing would happen. The game would be rather boring and dry.\n\nHowever, with intelligent enemy behaviors that are powered by AI, games are fast-paced and realistic now. If you find yourself in hot water in a game, there is no slowing down or just not following the console's instructions, you need to get out of that situation as fast as you can, just as you would in real life. This makes for a far more interesting and heart-pounding experience, which is probably exactly what you're after.\n\nYou don't engage with online games to be bored, you do so to be thrilled and get a taste of the action.\n\nAI Learns Alongside\n\nA big reason why AI has become so crucial in the world of online gaming is because, up until now, it has been the only thing that can be learned from the player's actions. Games that are powered through AI are now able to assess their players, see what moves players make in certain situations and then develop a strategy to try to keep the player on their toes. For example, imagine you're in an online game and you need to somehow make it through a mine field toward a certain bunker. But every time you try to move past one spike, the place blows up.\n\nAfter a few tries, you finally manage to figure out how to avoid that spike but then the game becomes boring because you've figured it out. AI games don't become boring. What happens in an AI game is that it would learn that you have figured out how to avoid that one spike, so it will put in a second spike to stop you from trying to re-do that move and therefore you will need to think on your feet yo figure out another way to gain access to the bunker. AI games learn with the player and always looking for ways to challenge and out-maneuver the player, to ensure ultimate gaming enjoyment.\n\nAdvanced Voice Controls and Virtual Reality Headsets\n\nA further development that has been born out of AI is advanced tech. This advanced tech comes in the form of voice controls and VR headsets, making the dreams of every gamer come true.\n\nAs the name suggests, voice controls give you the option of being able to tell your avatar what to do, purely based on what you speak into the mic. It is some high-level tech that is needed for avatars to be able to understand your verbal commands but with AI, anything is possible. This naturally speeds up the process and makes the player feel much more involved in the game, creating a far superior experience.\n\nSpeaking of superior experiences, virtual reality headsets are another thing players can look forward to. Pop one of these on and all of a sudden you are transported into a new world, a world where you get to physically control your avatar with your own movements, making for some of the most thrilling online experiences to date for sure.", "source": {"uri": "autogpt.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "AutoGPT Official"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defense of the Ancients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Land mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://autogpt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/adam_bidd_Today_a_pixel_art_style_of_matrix_inside_many_comou_fa32532e-6af8-4ccc-967a-9ca798909c0b_0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

These requirements mean that, in many ways, the AI Act amounts to a piece of product safety legislation. As such, organisations in those sectors well-versed in placing safety-critical products on the market are better prepared to comply with the product safety aspects of the Act than others. One such sector is life sciences, where there are very close parallels between the product safety features of medical device legislation and those of the AI Act. Our specialist life sciences regulatory team regularly advises clients on these matters, from risk classification, product liability, the need for conformity assessments, CE-marking and post-market surveillance, all of which are mirrored in the AI Act.\n\nBelow, we explore a few of those parallels and offer some potential lessons from medical device legislation for those seeking to comply with the product safety features of the AI Act, in the life sciences sector and beyond.\n\nMedical device law - quick background\n\nIn 2017, the EU adopted twin new regulations: the Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostics Medical Devices Regulation. These represented significant changes to the relatively well-established regulatory frameworks for medical devices and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices.\n\nThese new regulatory frameworks represented the biggest change in thirty years and imposed a number of more stringent requirements on \"Manufacturers\" (the entities with primary regulatory responsibility for a device). However, the new requirements were not reserved to \"Manufacturers\": new requirements were also imposed on other economic operators involved in the design, development and supply of components of medical devices.\n\nThis caused several issues for organisations involved in the supply chain, many of which seem set to be repeated by the EU AI Act. In fact, the AI Act is even more ambitious than the new economic operator requirements in that it also seeks to regulate entities that deploy AI systems and in certain instances, suppliers of components to high-risk AI systems. This will result in significantly additional compliance obligations in the supply chain.\n\nTight deadlines got extended and now proposed changes\n\nWhile all of these changes were well-intentioned and improved the regulatory framework, the implementation caused enormous difficulties and the withdrawal of products. These difficulties resulted in delays to the implementation of the new frameworks, extended transitional periods and now a proposal for a slew of amendments.\n\nIn our view, the main causes of the disruption associated with MDR and IVDR were:\n\nLikely to repeat each of these\n\nUnfortunately, each and every one of these missteps appear likely to be replicated with the adoption of the AI Act particularly for \"high-risk\" AI systems, which represent the primary portion of the AI Act. We can already see:\n\nThis is particularly disconcerting given that the requirements in the AI Act require all stakeholders to come to grips with totally new concepts like bias management and governance.\n\nFurther, frustratingly, there are a number of significant challenges reconciling the AI Act with the requirements under the MDR and the IVDR. This is crucial as the two regulatory frameworks are intended to operate in an interconnected manner. By way of example, the language in the AI Act is inconsistent with the accepted terminology for Conformity Assessment of existing products like medical devices. Worse, there are now some instances of serious unintentional conflicts between the requirements of the AI Act and the MDR and IVDR, whereby conducting an authorised clinical study in accordance with the MDR or IVDR might constitute an offence under the AI Act.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(EU)_2017/745", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Regulation (EU) 2017/745"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmarketing_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postmarketing surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In vitro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(EU)_2017/746", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulation (EU) 2017/746"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitteldeutscher_Rundfunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Men", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Reports show that teachers are turning to AI tools to assist with grading papers, writing feedback and developing lesson plans\n\nThe examiners have failed an examination. Research at Reading University showed that examiners could not differentiate between answer scripts written by actual students and GPT-4, one of the most advanced Artificial Intelligence programs, as much as 94% of the time. In fact, on several occasions, the technology scored higher than actual students, with AI failing to keep up with their human examinees only in the sphere of abstract reasoning. This incident raises interesting -- also concerning -- dimensions about the future relationship among humans, technology learning, and pedagogy. It has long been argued that neither short- nor long-form questions, the answers to which can be rote learned, are adequate to test students' knowledge. The arrival of AI has rendered such formats even more untrustworthy. Does this then merit a return to in-person exams -- these have been replaced with take-home tests in many parts of the world since the pandemic -- that evaluate students' competencies in a more practical and demonstrative manner and foster a meaningful engagement between students and their subjects? But examinations are just one aspect of the education system that has come under AI's shadow. Be it research papers, case studies, projects or even homework, there are now specific AI programs -- all based on the GPT-4 model -- that can do most of the students' academic work for them, including putting together citations and bibliographies. Worryingly, traditional plagiarism checks do not work on such AI-generated content and educators, too, are clearly struggling to tell real from fake. Students are not the only ones looking to AI for shortcuts either. Reports show that teachers are turning to AI tools and platforms to assist with grading papers, writing feedback, developing lesson plans and creating assignments.\n\nThis reliance on AI is concerning for several reasons. The most obvious apprehension is about the threat that this poses to independent thinking. AI's assimilate-and-generate model is based on reproducing knowledge that already exists. Replicating this in education could seriously impact knowledge creation. Moreover, as it has been established by several studies, AI is prone to biases: students, consequently, stand the risk of imbibing such prejudices in their work when they use AI. There is also the question of access. AI can widen the gaps in education by giving some students an unfair advantage and limiting the access of underprivileged communities to learning opportunities. AI's growing imprint on education, as is the case with all evolving technology, is a double-edged sword.

This shows a tipping point is emerging where bespoke AI is quickly becoming a realistic option for kaitiaki groups, even small ones.\n\nHowever, care is needed. Prior experiences show algorithm-powered systems often lock us into pathways that reproduce existing inequalities in data gathering and foreclose imagination about outcomes.\n\nThese problems often occur because of two interlinked problems: a legacy of ad hoc data gathering and an often misguided belief that larger data volume equals better accuracy.\n\nFirst, useful AI systems require rich data at speed and volume. The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has warned successive governments that New Zealand's environmental data system is ad hoc, opportunistic and under-resourced.\n\nExisting environmental databases largely reflect the priorities of state-led agricultural science and recent efforts to monitor its environmental impacts. Our environmental data also suffer from a systematic ignorance of mtauranga Mori.\n\nLong-running environmental datasets are very valuable. But they are very incomplete in their coverage of places and problems, and we cannot go back in time to redo the data gathering. Recognising the gaps and biases created by a history of uneven, exclusionary data generation is critical because it is those data (and the embedded assumptions) that will be used to train future AIs.\n\nSecond, AI promises certainty and precision. But a study investigating precision agriculture describes the emerging risks when we mistake high volume and granularity of big data for high accuracy. An exaggerated belief in the precision of big data can lead to an erosion of checks and balances.\n\nThis becomes an ever bigger issue as the murkiness of algorithms increases. Most algorithms are now unintelligible. This stems from technical complexity, user misunderstanding and intentional strategies of developers. It blinds us to the risks of inaccuracy.\n\nBy not paying attention to the opacity of algorithms we risk falling into a \"precision trap\". This occurs when belief in AI's precision translates into an unquestioning acceptance of the accuracy of AI outputs. This is a danger because of the political, social and legal value we give to numbers as trusted expressions of objective \"hard facts\".\n\nThese risks rise quickly when AI systems are used to forecast (and govern) future events based on precise but inaccurate models, unmoored from observations. But what happens when AI outputs are the basic fabric of evaluation and decision making? Do we have the option of not believing them at all?\n\nOne possible future lies in what the German sociologist Max Weber called the \"iron cage of rationality\". This is where communities become trapped in rational, precise and efficient systems that are simultaneously inhuman and inequitable.\n\nAvoiding this future means proactively creating inclusive, intelligible and diverse AI partnerships. This is not about rejecting rationality, but about tempering its irrational outcomes.\n\nOur evolving data and AI governance framework draws on the principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). These are very useful. They are also blind to social histories of data gathering.\n\nThe failure of the 2018 Census is a stark example of what happens when historical inequalities are ignored. We cannot redo the environmental data we have. But new AI systems need to have an awareness of the effects of past data gaps embedded in their design. It might also mean going beyond awareness to actively enriching data to address holes.\n\nData and AI need to serve human goals. Indigenous data sovereignty movements are claiming the right of Indigenous people to own and govern data about their communities, resources and lands. They have inspired frameworks known as CARE, which stands for collective benefit, authority, responsibility and ethics.\n\nThese offer a model of empowering data relations that put flourishing human relationships first. In Aotearoa New Zealand, Te Khui Raraunga Mori was established in 2019 as an independent body to enable Mori to access, collect and use their own data. Their data governance model is an example of these CARE principles in action.\n\nAn even bigger step forward would be to expand the worldview of AI. Serving human goals means exposing the assumptions and priorities baked into different AIs. This in turn means opening up the development of AI beyond what's been described as a \"WEIRD\" - western, educated, industrial, rich, developed - standpoint which currently dominates the field.\n\nTraining an AI on environmental data from Aotearoa New Zealand for Mori organisations is one thing. It is a more radical thing to create an AI that embodies mtauranga Mori and the responsibilities for life embedded in the Mori worldview.\n\nWe need this radical vision of AI, deliberately built from diverse worldviews, to avoid locking the cage and foreclosing the future.", "source": {"uri": "industriesnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "industriesnews.net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Environmental planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitiaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kaitiaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rationality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ad hoc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iwi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Commissioner_for_the_Environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precision agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Weber"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/ODc2Yjc4ZTEtNTc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Its relentless advancing capabilities across the board, its increasing adoption by citizens, and most importantly, its potential to redefine the very fabric of industry and society marks this as a transformative era,\" the former NITI Aayog CEO said at the Global IndiaAI Summit here.\n\nCiting industry body nasscom, Kant said 70 per cent of Indian startups prioritise AI to drive their growth, thus underscoring the critical role of AI in the startup ecosystem.\n\n\"India proudly holds the position of having the second highest number of GitHub AI projects globally, accounting for 19 per cent of worldwide AI projects. this demonstrates a vibrant and active engagement in AI development on an international scale.\n\n\"As we embrace this revolution, the question before us is not merely how we can participate but how we can lead the world. It is our opportunity and indeed our responsibility to harness this powerful technology to propel Indian companies to the forefront of the global stage,\" he said.\n\nKant, 68, said this is a moment to redefine what it means to be a leader and demonstrate that Indian startup enterprises are not just participants in this revolution, but are driving it with vigour, and vision.\n\n\"For me, strategic integration, AI-led data analytics, core R&D, ethics and governance are critical. Just as the first industrial revolution gave birth to various industries with the introduction of the steam engine, AI has the potential to revolutionise multiple sectors in India,\" he said.\n\nEstablishing AI integration across sectors like healthcare, logistics, agriculture, and FMCG is akin to laying down the foundational infrastructure of the steam-based power industry, he said.\n\n\"In healthcare, AI can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care efficiency, directly impacting patient outcome and healthcare delivery,\" Kant said.\n\nHe went on to elaborate on how AI can help transform logistics by streamlining supply chain operations and said rather than adopting a generalised approach, the key lies in developing customised AI solutions tailored to meet the specific needs of each sector.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of these AI applications, Kant said, it is important to analyse the objectives of enterprises and align them with AI capabilities.\n\nTo maintain a competitive edge globally, Indian businesses must fully leverage the stack of AI-driven data, he said.\n\nOn the government's procurement of 10,000 GPUs within the next 18-24 months, Kant said it is a strategic investment that will dramatically boost India's processing power, aligning its resources with its data generation capabilities.\n\n\"It is imperative that Indian enterprises do not merely consume at the frontier of productivity, we must lead it. We are presented with a defining opportunity that arises only once in a generation,\" Kant stressed.\n\nThe AI revolution confronts us with its own set of challenges, including biases, data security, and ethical use, he said.\n\nKant further said a proactive approach is essential for shaping a future where AI is trusted and ethical.

Take our quick AI survey and share your insights on the current state of AI, how you're implementing it, and what you expect to see in the future. Learn More\n\nMeta has thrown down the gauntlet in the race for more efficient artificial intelligence. The tech giant released pre-trained models on Wednesday that leverage a novel multi-token prediction approach, potentially changing how large language models (LLMs) are developed and deployed.\n\nIn April we published a paper on a new training approach for better & faster LLMs using multi-token prediction. To enable further exploration by researchers, we've released pre-trained models for code completion using this approach on @HuggingFace \u2b07\ufe0fhttps://t.co/OnUsGcDpYx -- AI at Meta (@AIatMeta) July 3, 2024\n\nThis new technique, first outlined in a Meta research paper in April, breaks from the traditional method of training LLMs to predict just the next word in a sequence. Instead, Meta's approach tasks models with forecasting multiple future words simultaneously, promising enhanced performance and drastically reduced training times.\n\nThe implications of this breakthrough could be far-reaching. As AI models balloon in size and complexity, their voracious appetite for computational power has raised concerns about cost and environmental impact. Meta's multi-token prediction method might offer a way to curb this trend, making advanced AI more accessible and sustainable.\n\nDemocratizing AI: The promise and perils of efficient language models\n\nThe potential of this new approach extends beyond mere efficiency gains. By predicting multiple tokens at once, these models may develop a more nuanced understanding of language structure and context. This could lead to improvements in tasks ranging from code generation to creative writing, potentially bridging the gap between AI and human-level language understanding.\n\nCountdown to VB Transform 2024\n\nJoin enterprise leaders in San Francisco from July 9 to 11 for our flagship AI event.

After all, the images generated by these platforms may well be the result of a thousand cuts of (or off) other images.\n\nBut what would the use of AI generated images arguably be leading to the 'death' of?\n\nThe answer to this rhetorical question is, in my view, as follows.\n\nAI generated imagery is metaphorically killing the need for photographers and their expertise. Creative agencies, inhouse designers, marketers and businesses using AI generated imagery are doing so instead of using either licensed or original images taken by real, flesh n' bone photographers. Some AI images, I will honestly admit, are truly incredible - especially if the AI images have been modified by skilled designers - but the inescapable truth is the use of AI imagery is doing photographers out of a job.\n\nAI generated imagery is also metaphorically killing the art of photography because commercial photographers, at least, are no longer being incentivised to create new images. As a result, AI generated imagery is also metaphorically killing the expansion of the 'bank' of images from which AI generated images are drawn (legally or otherwise) - if not completely, then not fast enough to sustain a healthy AI imagery eco-system.\n\nThere is no doubt that AI platforms such as Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, etc are amazing tools for creative agencies and brands. They come at a cost, though, to photographers who have spent years if not decades on developing their craft. They also come at a cost to brands because, at present at least, brands cannot own copyright in AI generated images per se - consequently, they cannot, under copyright law at least, stop a competitor from using the same or very similar AI generated images.\n\nI believe brands and businesses in general need photographers. Yes, need. Sure, AI generated imagery may be cheaper and more 'convenient' to 'create' (especially for those outdoor scenic shots up a mountainside on a stormy night), but without a constantly updating bank of images to draw from, the composition of images generated by AI will become homogenous. Add to that the risk that, on finding out images used by a brand are AI generated, consumers may feel misled or 'cheated' - especially in the realm of social media and influencers. Brands and businesses need to be able to differentiate their goods and services in the market and original, photographer-taken images - in which exclusive ownership of copyright can be claimed - is a proven way to achieve this.\n\nAI generated imagery is undoubtedly here to stay. There must be a balance, however, between the cost and convenience of AI generated imagery and the need for creativity and commercial differentiation. That said, with the constant need for new 'flesh' to feed the AI imagery beast, photographers might actually end up being in more demand than ever before...", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingchi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lingchi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Walls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

This shows a tipping point is emerging where bespoke AI is quickly becoming a realistic option for kaitiaki groups, even small ones.\n\nHowever, care is needed. Prior experiences show algorithm-powered systems often lock us into pathways that reproduce existing inequalities in data gathering and foreclose imagination about outcomes.\n\nThese problems often occur because of two interlinked problems: a legacy of ad hoc data gathering and an often misguided belief that larger data volume equals better accuracy.\n\nFirst, useful AI systems require rich data at speed and volume. The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has warned successive governments that New Zealand's environmental data system is ad hoc, opportunistic and under-resourced.\n\nExisting environmental databases largely reflect the priorities of state-led agricultural science and recent efforts to monitor its environmental impacts. Our environmental data also suffer from a systematic ignorance of m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori.\n\nLong-running environmental datasets are very valuable. But they are very incomplete in their coverage of places and problems, and we cannot go back in time to redo the data gathering. Recognising the gaps and biases created by a history of uneven, exclusionary data generation is critical because it is those data (and the embedded assumptions) that will be used to train future AIs.\n\nSecond, AI promises certainty and precision. But a study investigating precision agriculture describes the emerging risks when we mistake high volume and granularity of big data for high accuracy. An exaggerated belief in the precision of big data can lead to an erosion of checks and balances.\n\nThis becomes an ever bigger issue as the murkiness of algorithms increases. Most algorithms are now unintelligible. This stems from technical complexity, user misunderstanding and intentional strategies of developers. It blinds us to the risks of inaccuracy.\n\nBy not paying attention to the opacity of algorithms we risk falling into a \"precision trap\". This occurs when belief in AI's precision translates into an unquestioning acceptance of the accuracy of AI outputs. This is a danger because of the political, social and legal value we give to numbers as trusted expressions of objective \"hard facts\".\n\nThese risks rise quickly when AI systems are used to forecast (and govern) future events based on precise but inaccurate models, unmoored from observations. But what happens when AI outputs are the basic fabric of evaluation and decision making? Do we have the option of not believing them at all?\n\nOne possible future lies in what the German sociologist Max Weber called the \"iron cage of rationality\". This is where communities become trapped in rational, precise and efficient systems that are simultaneously inhuman and inequitable.\n\nAvoiding this future means proactively creating inclusive, intelligible and diverse AI partnerships. This is not about rejecting rationality, but about tempering its irrational outcomes.\n\nOur evolving data and AI governance framework draws on the principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). These are very useful. They are also blind to social histories of data gathering.\n\nThe failure of the 2018 Census is a stark example of what happens when historical inequalities are ignored. We cannot redo the environmental data we have. But new AI systems need to have an awareness of the effects of past data gaps embedded in their design. It might also mean going beyond awareness to actively enriching data to address holes.\n\nData and AI need to serve human goals. Indigenous data sovereignty movements are claiming the right of Indigenous people to own and govern data about their communities, resources and lands. They have inspired frameworks known as CARE, which stands for collective benefit, authority, responsibility and ethics.\n\nThese offer a model of empowering data relations that put flourishing human relationships first. In Aotearoa New Zealand, Te K\u0101hui Raraunga M\u0101ori was established in 2019 as an independent body to enable M\u0101ori to access, collect and use their own data. Their data governance model is an example of these CARE principles in action.\n\nAn even bigger step forward would be to expand the worldview of AI. Serving human goals means exposing the assumptions and priorities baked into different AIs. This in turn means opening up the development of AI beyond what's been described as a \"WEIRD\" - western, educated, industrial, rich, developed - standpoint which currently dominates the field.\n\nTraining an AI on environmental data from Aotearoa New Zealand for M\u0101ori organisations is one thing. It is a more radical thing to create an AI that embodies m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori and the responsibilities for life embedded in the M\u0101ori worldview.\n\nWe need this radical vision of AI, deliberately built from diverse worldviews, to avoid locking the cage and foreclosing the future.\n\nMatthew Henry received funding from the Our Land and Water National Science Challenge for his work in the Kuaha Matahiko research project.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitiaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kaitiaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ad hoc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_professor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associate professor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rationality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massey University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hap\u016b", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hap\u016b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iwi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101tauranga_M\u0101ori", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Commissioner_for_the_Environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precision agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Weber"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices_and_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices and Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 45}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

The phenomenon occurs due to the limitations in training the AI model or the model's inefficacy in distinguishing between reliable and unreliable data sources.\n\nSuch hallucinations are often manifested as presented well but are fictional, non-sensical, or incorrect facts. The issue signals a need to evaluate the current AI-generated content and improvise the models.\n\nHow do AI hallucinations happen?\n\nBefore we understand why AI hallucinations happen, let us tell you how these language models work. Unlike human beings' language, models perceive words like a sequence of letters. Similarly, sentences generated by language models are sequences of words. The knowledge of these language models comes from its backend training data (they are fed with a vast collection of text).\n\nGiven that the models use statistical data to predict what the next phrase or sentence could be rather than truly understanding the context, the models can make mistakes. These mistakes are hallucinations. They happen when the language model confidently generates information that is either non-sensical or incorrect.\n\nLanguage models hallucinate due to one or all of the following reasons:\n\nRead More: AI and ChatGPT: How Various Brands and Industries are Using These Platforms and Technologies to Enable Different Goals\n\nThe mistakes or inefficacy in training language models lie at the core of why AI hallucinations happen. Here are the critical aspects of training data leading to these training issues:\n\nWhen we ask anything to language models, we cannot forget that they are machines and cannot read between the lines like humans do. If we start asking complex and confusing questions to the models, it will impact the quality of the output.\n\nThe mistakes happen in the following three ways:\n\nAI hallucinations may occur in language models because most of these models take their data from previous generations. To counteract the problem, it is essential to incorporate human feedback. Humans build these models, and we must learn to bring a balance between practicality and innovation. Too much novelty may lead to new but incorrect outputs.\n\nBesides, technical issues in processing of AI language models can also produce AI hallucinations.

After all, most AI is likely to show up as enhanced features in the business software that companies rely on in their daily operations.\n\nHowever, the BVP Nasdaq index of cloud software companies is down nearly 10 per cent this year, while the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 20 per cent. It has also halved from its pandemic-era peak. The slump points to an industry at a crossroads. A long, secular growth phase driven by the rise of the cloud looks like it is entering a new and more mature state, while the next (the spread of generative AI in business) has barely begun.\n\nAt times like this, Wall Street faces complex questions. If the cloud business really is maturing, the focus of investors needs to shift more quickly from growth to value. Tech companies that recently reported disappointing results, such as Salesforce, MongoDB and Workday, have tried to pass the lull off as the result of extended economic weakness. But the longer it goes on, the harder this argument is to sustain. Salesforce's revenues doubled in the past four years to $36bn: at that scale, the slower 10 per cent growth it has projected for next year begins to look more like the norm.\n\nAt the same time, investors have to handicap which companies will catch the next wave of growth and which will fail to adapt and be left in the dust.\n\nAccording to the companies themselves, the lack of an impact on their sales from AI is just a timing issue. Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, for instance, points to the challenge of training large armies of salespeople to handle what he calls \"a harder, more complex sell\". Customers are grappling with a wide set of questions, seeking to understand how the new AI models work and how their workers should interact with them. They also need to consider how to redesign their work processes to make best use of the technology, as well as deal with new threats to the security of their data.\n\nEven if sales are still negligible, the software companies report huge interest from customers in piloting their new AI services. This may mean the AI dividend has just been delayed.\n\nYet the disruptive threats from AI suggest things will not be so straightforward. One is the upheaval to the cloud companies' business model. Most rely on charging per-seat subscriptions, meaning their revenue goes up in line with the number of workers using their services. If generative AI works as promised and makes workers far more productive, customers should be able to do more with fewer staff.\n\nThe result has been a pivot towards consumption-based pricing, or charging based on how much the new services are actually used. Tying fees to usage has the added advantage of offsetting some of the higher cost of delivering generative AI. But unless this leads to real and demonstrable business benefits, the software companies could face a backlash when customers see their bills soar.\n\nThe software groups also have tech history to contend with. In the past, new tech eras -- such as the rise of client-server computing in the 1990s and cloud computing the following decade -- have brought new waves of start-up software companies to the fore. New companies, their products and business models designed from the ground up to fit a new computing paradigm start with a big advantage.\n\nThe first wave of these \"AI native\" software companies has often looked like little more than \"wrappers\" around the large language models, adding only a veneer of industry-specific expertise as they offer businesses ways to adopt generative AI. But they are all working hard to gain a foothold from where they can start to build out more compelling services.\n\nAccording to Salesforce's Benioff, the incumbents will be hard to unseat. Companies such as his have become the repositories of their customers' most important data, he says, giving them a big advantage when it comes to training the AI models that businesses will find truly useful.\n\nThat will only count if today's cloud companies can adapt their own products and processes to the new technology fast enough.

China's existing laws do not have detailed provisions for intellectual property rights related to AI. So the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Intellectual Property Protection and Planning has proposed to \"improve intellectual property protection policies, and establish a sound intellectual property protection system for new fields and formats such as big data, artificial intelligence, and genetic technology\".\n\nMaking clear the position of AIGC in intellectual property laws is key to exploring the AI issue from the perspective of IPRs. It is especially important to determine whether AIGC fulfills the requirements for being protected by IP laws, such as whether the products generated by AI meet the conditions for protection under the Copyright Law and whether the AI-assisted inventions and creations qualify to be protected by the Patent Law.\n\nThe mainstream view of Chinese academia on IP law is that AIGCs have creativeness and should be considered intellectual achievements. On the other hand, the minority view is that creations protected by copyright must be products of natural persons' intellectual labor, and AIGCs are devoid of this characteristic.\n\nSeveral typical copyright disputes involving AIGC have occurred in China in recent years, and it is affirmed that the majority of AIGCs are protected by copyright.\n\nIn the recent \"Dreamwriter\" case, the Nanshan District People's Court in Shenzhen said the content created by users with the help of AI meets the conditions for being protected by the Copyright Law, suggesting that AI-generated works ought to be protected by the law. The judgment was in favor of the plaintiff, Shenzhen-based tech giant Tencent, and against the defendant.\n\nIn the \"Stable Diffusion\" case, too, the Beijing Internet Court held that the works generated by users with the help of AI are original works protected by the Copyright Law, and users can become the owners of such works.\n\nHowever, in the \"Feilin v. Baidu\" case in 2019, the Beijing Internet Court ruled that the works protected by the Copyright Law should be the result of the intellectual labor of natural persons, and denied copyright protection to the works involved.\n\nWith the development of generative AI technology, AIGCs have evolved into Sora (a generative AI model developed by OpenAI which specializes in text-to-video generation). In fact, IPR issues involved in AI are not limited to whether the products generated by AI are protected by IPR laws, they also include other issues -- for example, the identity of the author of an AI-generated work, the identity of the inventor of AI-generated inventions and creations, the corresponding ownership of IPRs, and the legal liability of AI service providers for IPR infringement of AI-generated products.\n\nDepartmental regulations are occasionally used to analyze the nature and legal status of AIGC. For example, Article 4 of the Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services, which came into effect on Aug 15, 2023, says the provision and use of generative AI services should respect IP rights.\n\nAnd Article 7 stipulates that providers of generative AI services shall conduct training for data processing including pre-training and optimization training in accordance with the law and use data and basic models from legitimate sources. Besides, none should infringe upon the IP rights of others.\n\nThe lack of laws and regulations on AIGC raises the risk of legal disputes over IPR issues, especially because of the increasing application and industrialization of AI technology. The cases mentioned above are a testament to this.\n\nGiven the challenges created by the development and industrialization of AI, the AI sector should strengthen legislation on AIGC. This is especially important because while the European Union has already enacted an AI bill, China is still conducting research to finalize a draft, and the AI Act has been included in the legislative plan.\n\nThe lawmakers in China should reach a consensus on the positioning of AIGC in the Copyright Law, and make clear the intellectual property of AI-generated products. On the other hand, it is necessary to distinguish between text and data mining for data training in AIGC and recognizing their nature for possible fair use in order to promote the AI industry's development.\n\nAnd to maintain the order of the cultural market and encourage natural persons to use intellectual labor to produce new products, mandatory attribution rules need to be established for AI-generated works to distinguish between natural persons' original works and AI-generated works.\n\nIt is also necessary to make clear the legal status of AI-generated inventions and creations, and make necessary modifications to the rules and patent-determining guidelines accompanying the Patent Law to scrutinize patent applications for AI-generated inventions and creations.\n\nAs for AI service providers using AI to infringe on the IP rights of others, it is necessary to strengthen anti-IP infringement rules in the field of AI, make clear the subjective fault standards and fix accountability for such infringements.\n\nWith the development of generative AI technology and the industrialization of AI technology, new IPR issues are bound to arise. Therefore, a balance should be struck between protecting IPRs and promoting the development of AI technology and industry.\n\nThe author is a chair professor at Jimei University and a professor at China University of Political Science and Law.\n\nThe views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Property law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emerging technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tencent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrialisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baidu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanshan_District,_Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanshan District, Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nanshan District, Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Daily", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China Daily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 55}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202407/04/6685e3bca31095c551b48997.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 3379, "textEnd": 3385}], "sentiment": 0.7725490196078431, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

These include areas like critical infrastructure and law enforcement.\n\nThe Act also sets a key boundary for categorising other high-risk products: third-party conformity assessments with previously enacted sector-specific regulations.\n\nSuch AI systems need to meet two criteria to be classified as high-risk:\n\nThe first is that the system is a safety component of a product, or the AI system is a product itself, that is covered by pre-existing legislation.\n\nThe second is that this type of component or product is required to go through a third-party assessment to demonstrate compliance under previously enacted rules.\n\nAccording to the Commission's document, components related to cybersecurity and access to emergency services satisfy both these criteria in RED, making them high-risk systems.\n\nHowever, the Commission's preliminary view is that even in some cases where the RED foresees an opt-out from the third-party assessment, meaning when a company can demonstrate compliance by a self-assessment with harmonised standards, this is merely a procedural mechanism.\n\nAs such, even where such opt-outs exist, the AI-based components, in this case related to cybersecurity, are still deemed high-risk.\n\nThe AI Act lists a barrage of previously enacted sectoral regulation that might be used to classify AI products as high-risk. More documents like the one on RED can be expected.\n\nIn addition to electronics, products like medical devices, aviation, heavy machinery, even \"personal watercraft\" and lifts are covered by harmonised legislation relevant for the AI Act, so they might undergo a similar process as RED.\n\nThe preliminary interpretation shows that similar self-assessment standards likely cannot be used to remove the high-risk tag from AI products in these industries.\n\nThe AI Act places considerable requirements on high-risk AI systems. AI systems that are not in this category only face minor transparency obligations.\n\nThe question is therefore which systems fall into the high-risk category.\n\nWhile the Commission estimated 5-15% of AI systems will be classified as high risk in 2021, a 2022 survey of 113 EU-based startups said it had found that 33-50% of the startups think of their own product as high risk.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euractiv", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euractiv"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet of things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procedural programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Watercraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety_Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Safety Products and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/shutterstock_2317670971-800x450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

This shows a tipping point is emerging where bespoke AI is quickly becoming a realistic option for kaitiaki groups, even small ones.\n\nHowever, care is needed. Prior experiences show algorithm-powered systems often lock us into pathways that reproduce existing inequalities in data gathering and foreclose imagination about outcomes.\n\nThese problems often occur because of two interlinked problems: a legacy of ad hoc data gathering and an often misguided belief that larger data volume equals better accuracy.\n\nFirst, useful AI systems require rich data at speed and volume. The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has warned successive governments that New Zealand's environmental data system is ad hoc, opportunistic and under-resourced.\n\nExisting environmental databases largely reflect the priorities of state-led agricultural science and recent efforts to monitor its environmental impacts. Our environmental data also suffer from a systematic ignorance of m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori.\n\nLong-running environmental datasets are very valuable. But they are very incomplete in their coverage of places and problems, and we cannot go back in time to redo the data gathering. Recognizing the gaps and biases created by a history of uneven, exclusionary data generation is critical because it is those data (and the embedded assumptions) that will be used to train future AIs.\n\nSecond, AI promises certainty and precision. But a study investigating precision agriculture describes the emerging risks when we mistake high volume and granularity of big data for high accuracy. An exaggerated belief in the precision of big data can lead to an erosion of checks and balances.\n\nThis becomes an ever bigger issue as the murkiness of algorithms increases. Most algorithms are now unintelligible. This stems from technical complexity, user misunderstanding and intentional strategies of developers. It blinds us to the risks of inaccuracy.\n\nBy not paying attention to the opacity of algorithms we risk falling into a \"precision trap\". This occurs when belief in AI's precision translates into an unquestioning acceptance of the accuracy of AI outputs. This is a danger because of the political, social and legal value we give to numbers as trusted expressions of objective \"hard facts\".\n\nThese risks rise quickly when AI systems are used to forecast (and govern) future events based on precise but inaccurate models, unmoored from observations. But what happens when AI outputs are the basic fabric of evaluation and decision making? Do we have the option of not believing them at all?\n\nOne possible future lies in what the German sociologist Max Weber called the \"iron cage of rationality\". This is where communities become trapped in rational, precise and efficient systems that are simultaneously inhuman and inequitable.\n\nAvoiding this future means proactively creating inclusive, intelligible and diverse AI partnerships. This is not about rejecting rationality, but about tempering its irrational outcomes.\n\nOur evolving data and AI governance framework draws on the principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). These are very useful. They are also blind to social histories of data gathering.\n\nThe failure of the 2018 Census is a stark example of what happens when historical inequalities are ignored. We cannot redo the environmental data we have. But new AI systems need to have an awareness of the effects of past data gaps embedded in their design. It might also mean going beyond awareness to actively enriching data to address holes.\n\nData and AI need to serve human goals. Indigenous data sovereignty movements are claiming the right of Indigenous people to own and govern data about their communities, resources and lands. They have inspired frameworks known as CARE, which stands for collective benefit, authority, responsibility and ethics.\n\nThese offer a model of empowering data relations that put flourishing human relationships first. In Aotearoa New Zealand, Te K\u0101hui Raraunga M\u0101ori was established in 2019 as an independent body to enable M\u0101ori to access, collect and use their own data. Their data governance model is an example of these CARE principles in action.\n\nAn even bigger step forward would be to expand the worldview of AI.

This shows a tipping point is emerging where bespoke AI is quickly becoming a realistic option for kaitiaki groups, even small ones.\n\nHowever, care is needed. Prior experiences show algorithm-powered systems often lock us into pathways that reproduce existing inequalities in data gathering and foreclose imagination about outcomes.\n\nThese problems often occur because of two interlinked problems: a legacy of ad hoc data gathering and an often misguided belief that larger data volume equals better accuracy.\n\nThe 'precision trap'\n\nFirst, useful AI systems require rich data at speed and volume. The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has warned successive governments that New Zealand's environmental data system is ad hoc, opportunistic and under-resourced.\n\nExisting environmental databases largely reflect the priorities of state-led agricultural science and recent efforts to monitor its environmental impacts. Our environmental data also suffer from a systematic ignorance of m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori.\n\nLong-running environmental datasets are very valuable. But they are very incomplete in their coverage of places and problems, and we cannot go back in time to redo the data gathering. Recognising the gaps and biases created by a history of uneven, exclusionary data generation is critical because it is those data (and the embedded assumptions) that will be used to train future AIs.\n\nSecond, AI promises certainty and precision. But a study investigating precision agriculture describes the emerging risks when we mistake high volume and granularity of big data for high accuracy. An exaggerated belief in the precision of big data can lead to an erosion of checks and balances.\n\nThis becomes an ever bigger issue as the murkiness of algorithms increases. Most algorithms are now unintelligible. This stems from technical complexity, user misunderstanding and intentional strategies of developers. It blinds us to the risks of inaccuracy.\n\nBy not paying attention to the opacity of algorithms we risk falling into a \"precision trap\". This occurs when belief in AI's precision translates into an unquestioning acceptance of the accuracy of AI outputs. This is a danger because of the political, social and legal value we give to numbers as trusted expressions of objective \"hard facts\".\n\nThese risks rise quickly when AI systems are used to forecast (and govern) future events based on precise but inaccurate models, unmoored from observations. But what happens when AI outputs are the basic fabric of evaluation and decision making? Do we have the option of not believing them at all?\n\nAvoiding an 'iron cage'\n\nOne possible future lies in what the German sociologist Max Weber called the \"iron cage of rationality\". This is where communities become trapped in rational, precise and efficient systems that are simultaneously inhuman and inequitable.\n\nAvoiding this future means proactively creating inclusive, intelligible and diverse AI partnerships. This is not about rejecting rationality, but about tempering its irrational outcomes.\n\nOur evolving data and AI governance framework draws on the principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). These are very useful. They are also blind to social histories of data gathering.\n\nThe failure of the 2018 Census is a stark example of what happens when historical inequalities are ignored. We cannot redo the environmental data we have. But new AI systems need to have an awareness of the effects of past data gaps embedded in their design. It might also mean going beyond awareness to actively enriching data to address holes.\n\nWidening the worldview of AI\n\nData and AI need to serve human goals. Indigenous data sovereignty movements are claiming the right of Indigenous people to own and govern data about their communities, resources and lands. They have inspired frameworks known as CARE, which stands for collective benefit, authority, responsibility and ethics.\n\nThese offer a model of empowering data relations that put flourishing human relationships first. In Aotearoa New Zealand, Te K\u0101hui Raraunga M\u0101ori was established in 2019 as an independent body to enable M\u0101ori to access, collect and use their own data. Their data governance model is an example of these CARE principles in action.\n\nAn even bigger step forward would be to expand the worldview of AI. Serving human goals means exposing the assumptions and priorities baked into different AIs. This in turn means opening up the development of AI beyond what's been described as a \"WEIRD\" - western, educated, industrial, rich, developed - standpoint which currently dominates the field.\n\nTraining an AI on environmental data from Aotearoa New Zealand for M\u0101ori organisations is one thing. It is a more radical thing to create an AI that embodies m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori and the responsibilities for life embedded in the M\u0101ori worldview.\n\nWe need this radical vision of AI, deliberately built from diverse worldviews, to avoid locking the cage and foreclosing the future.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitiaki", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kaitiaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ad hoc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massey_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massey University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hap\u016b", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hap\u016b"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iwi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u0101tauranga_M\u0101ori", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Commissioner_for_the_Environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rationality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precision agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Weber"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/604479/original/file-20240702-19-juw6um.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=95%2C239%2C7892%2C3892&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) just might be this long-awaited technology.\n\nWith AI, software and systems are used in place of humans to oversee and/or undertake tasks. The true value of AI lies in the ability of these systems to learn over time without human intervention. This allows AI-driven software and systems to become more effective at tasks and perhaps even learn new jobs over time.\n\nAlthough estimates are all over the map, as you'd expect from a still relatively unknown technology, the analysts at PwC released a report last year in which they estimate AI can add up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade.\n\nWith an addressable market this large, a lot of companies can come out as winners. But that doesn't mean you can throw a dart at a written list of AI stocks and automatically make money.\n\nFor the moment, no company is more directly benefiting from the AI revolution than Nvidia (NVDA 4.57%). Since the start of 2023, Nvidia's stock has gained up to $3 trillion in market value, with the company's board recently approving a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nNvidia's otherworldly gains and textbook operational scaling are the result of its AI-driven graphics processing units (GPUs) becoming the standard in high-compute data centers. With demand for these chips absolutely overwhelming their supply, Nvidia has been able to meaningfully increase its prices and reap the rewards.\n\nUnfortunately, every next-big-thing innovation over the last 30 years, including the internet, underwent an early-stage bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors consistently overestimate the adoption and/or utility of new technologies, innovations, or trends. AI will need time to mature, just like every next-big-thing innovation before it, and that bodes poorly for Nvidia's stock.\n\nBut not all artificial intelligence stocks would be in trouble if the AI bubble burst. Thanks to their foundational operating segments, the following five historically cheap AI stocks can be confidently bought for the second half of 2024.\n\nThe first cheap AI stock that you can gobble up with confidence for the latter half of the current year (and likely hold well beyond 2024) is social media giant Meta Platforms (META 0.09%).\n\nThe beauty of Meta's operating model is that it generates close to 98% of its revenue from advertising. Even though CEO Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in AI data centers, the metaverse, and various augmented/virtual reality devices, Meta's prime social media \"real estate,\" coupled with lengthy periods of expansion for the U.S. and global economy, are what power its operating cash flow and profits at the end of the day.\n\nAs of the end of March, Meta was luring 3.24 billion users to its social media platforms each day. Advertisers are well aware that there's no better alternative to reach users than to advertise with Meta.\n\nEven after more than quintupling from its 2022 bear market low, shares of Meta can be purchased right now for less than 14 times estimated cash flow for 2025. For context, this is a 6% discount to its average forward-year cash flow multiple over the last five years and represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in every year over the last decade, save for 2022.\n\nThe next exceptionally inexpensive artificial intelligence stock you can buy without fear in the second half of 2024 is China-based e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba (BABA 2.56%).\n\nAccording to the International Trade Administration, Alibaba is China's top dog in online retail sales, with Taobao and Tmall accounting for an estimated 50.8% share of China's e-commerce sales. Even with China's economy stuck in neutral following the COVID-19 pandemic, an eventual strengthening of the country's burgeoning middle class should lift the long-term prospects for this segment.\n\nFurther, Alibaba Cloud is China's leading cloud infrastructure service platform by revenue. Alibaba Cloud is where generative AI solutions can be offered to customers to support and enhance their businesses. Enterprise spending on cloud services is still in its very early stages of ramping up.\n\nShares of Alibaba are currently valued at less than 8 times forward-year earnings, which is a steal when you account for its $85.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and various investments as of March 31.\n\nThere's no question that Nvidia has left Intel in the dust over the last 18 months. But in the second half of this year, Intel is releasing its Gaudi 3 AI-accelerator chip on a broad scale. With Nvidia unable to meet the demand of all its customers, Intel and its rivals should be able to easily grab share.\n\nBut there's more to like about Intel than just its AI ties. Its legacy central processing unit (CPU) operations for personal computers and traditional data centers remain a cash cow for the company. This cash is being reinvested in various high-growth initiatives, such as the company's foundry services segment. By 2030, Intel anticipates becoming the world's No. 2 chip fabrication company.\n\nIn terms of value, Intel is trading at 25% above its book value of $24.89 per share. With the exception of September 2022-March 2023, Intel stock hasn't been this cheap, relative to its book value, dating back to the mid-1980s!\n\nThe fourth bargain AI stock investors can confidently add to their portfolios for the second half of this year is China-based internet search titan Baidu (BIDU 3.67%).\n\nSimilar to Meta, Alibaba, and Intel, the bursting of the AI bubble wouldn't derail Baidu. That's because it's China's leading internet search engine. Over the trailing-10-year period, it's pretty consistently accounted for 50% to 85% of internet search share for the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. This means predictable operating cash flow and strong ad-pricing power for Baidu.\n\nHowever, AI represents the company's future. Baidu's AI Cloud is China's fourth-largest cloud infrastructure service platform. Meanwhile, Baidu-owned Apollo Go is the world's most successful autonomous ride-hailing service, based on total rides since its inception (more than 6 million). These non-online marketing segments have consistently grown at a faster pace than Baidu's internet search engine.\n\nA forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of only 7 is unbelievably low for a company sporting roughly $26 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet.\n\nDespite Amazon's stock hitting an all-time high, its multiple to trailing-12-month operating cash flow is near a decade low. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) data by YCharts. CFO = cash flow from operations. TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nThe fifth historically cheap AI stock begging to be bought for the second half of 2024 is Amazon (AMZN -1.21%), the world's other dominant e-commerce player.\n\nAccording to estimates, Amazon accounted for a nearly 38% share of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. But while this segment brings in plenty of revenue, it does little for Amazon's cash flow or operating income. Where the company generates most of its growth and operating cash flow -- and where AI will come in handiest -- is its ancillary operations.\n\nNo segment is more important to Amazon's long-term success than Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure services platform and recently topped $100 billion in annual run-rate revenue. AWS can deploy various AI and generative AI solutions to help businesses train large language models and run virtual assistants.\n\nDon't forget about advertising services or subscription services, either. These two segments are also growing by a steady double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis. As Amazon's e-commerce marketplace and content library grow, it should be able to command a premium subscription price for Prime.\n\nAlthough Amazon isn't cheap based on the traditionally used P/E ratio, it is historically inexpensive relative to its future cash flow. Shares can be purchased right now for around 13 times the consensus cash flow in 2025, which is markedly lower than the median multiple of 30 times year-end cash flow investors gladly paid to own Amazon stock throughout the 2010s.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_williams@fool.com", "name": "Sean Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alibaba Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PwC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PwC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baidu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alibaba Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/782474/artificial-intelligence-ai-robot-big-data-bull-market-stock-chart-getty.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 4721, "textEnd": 4729}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

AI chatbot to help understand the world of AI regulation", "body": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more dominant in the pharma industry, regulators have started developing guidance as to how it can be used. There are complexities however, especially for sponsors conducting global trials using AI to abide by regulation from different regions.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in the midst of developing guidance for the use of AI and machine learning (ML) in drug development and has already released guidance on the use of AI and ML in medical devices. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also released draft guidance on the use of AI in the medicinal lifecycle, covering both drugs and medical devices. On top of this, sponsors must also abide by local legal frameworks, such as the European Union's (EU's) AI act.\n\nWithout a team that can constantly keep on top of all these legislations, there is potential that a sponsor may not be complicit when designing and running a trial.\n\nSingapore-based RegAsk has developed an augmented-AI chat bot, RegGenius which allow sponsors to ask questions about how they must abide across all regions. The chat bot provides information for all regulatory guidance.\n\nThe Clinical Trials Arena team spoke with RegAsk's chief product technology officer (CPTO) Amenallah Reghimi about the new guidance's and how this software provides the answers sponsors need, especially considering the ability for interpretation.\n\nAR: Given the speed and evolution of AI regulation, it is important that sponsors have up to date, accessible information that is actionable. I anticipate that AI regulation will become more stringent and more comprehensive over the coming months and years, with a focus on ethical use and safety. I believe companies need to invest in an adaptable and robust compliance system to ensure that during changes it can remain compliant.\n\nAR: That is one of the biggest challenges for RegGenius. Not only does regulation vary between countries but also between products. There are four levels we are working on with RegGenius to help here in tracking all the latest regulatory updates across the multiple agencies, ensuring that the user has always access to the most current information. RegGenius works behind the scenes, scanning regulatory sites daily to get the most up to date information. Finally, it will inform the user of upcoming guidance to be aware of so that can be taken into consideration.\n\nAR: RegGenius will use the contextual information about the specific trial in question to help formulate a response. This is one of the most important parts of the software - the understanding that can be built in. The sponsor can feed in information so that the AI chatbot will have all the knowledge it needs about the trial it needs to properly formulate an answer. This includes information about the geography, the indication, the type of drug, the phase - all of this can change the regulatory considerations a sponsor needs to take. This is important because it reduces the possibility of AI hallucination.\n\nAR: This is a real challenge. Regulation, by default, is not black and white and sponsors often want black and white answers. To try and manage this, we have a pool of regulatory experts, both at an internal and external level. So if there is some interpretation, we can run a question by a few experts and decide the best practice. RegGenius connects the sponsor with a network of regulatory experts and consultant, who can then provide additional interpretation advice. AI is great, it's people not technology that are the key to succeeding with AI. That's why it's always taking it back to that human expertise. That human expertise can bridge the gap between the open-ended guidance and the specific needs of the sponsor. The way it displays for the sponsor is by providing a generated response with references but then asking whether the sponsor wants that expert consultation. That is the best way we have found to navigate the complexities of AI regulation with confidence and precision.\n\nAR: We have both an internal team which is customer facing and an expert network which is not. RegGenius connects with those external partners and those answers go through the internal regulatory affairs teams to be reviewed and validated. Because this is regulatory affairs, precision and confidence are very important, so we do not think it is wise to put the customer directly with the external expert.\n\n\"How can (A)I help?

The Framework addresses the increasing challenges to data protection and cybersecurity in the era of artificial intelligence (\"AI\"), while providing the necessary practical and internationally recognised practices to safeguard personal data when Hong Kong is transforming itself into an innovation and technology hub.\n\nBackground of the Framework\n\nThe constant evolution of AI technologies has led to various challenges for legislative bodies in maintaining a flexible yet proportionate set of regulations that reflect the need to address the legal risks through the use of AI, which include but are not limited to data protection, cybersecurity, intellectual property infringement, defamation and discrimination.\n\nIn 2021, the PCPD published the \"Guidance on the Ethical Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence\" (\"Guidance\"), which introduced the seven ethical principles for AI and the three data stewardship values. The Framework now builds upon the Guidance by providing a detailed set of recommendations to organisations when procuring, implementing, and using any AI systems, which include predictive and generative AI. By structuring the Framework around modern business needs and practices, the Framework is a timely and welcomed initiative which allows organisations to reexamine their governance strategies and policies on their daily use (or intended use) of AI, while complying with the existing Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) (\"PDPO\") and protecting its data against cybersecurity risks.\n\nThe Framework\n\nThe Framework advocates for the formulation of appropriate policies, practices and procedures when AI solutions are procured, implemented, and used. In particular, organisations are recommended to consider and adopt the following key measures:\n\nImplications of the Framework\n\nThe use of AI has brought significant risks and challenges to organisations, including the occurrence of inaccurate output, unethical use, infringing materials, and data protection risks. Such risks, coupled with the day-to-day advancement of the existing technologies, make it more and more important for organisations to reconsider their overall strategy and governance approach to AI.\n\nAs organisations in Hong Kong gradually embrace technological advancements through the use of AI, the Framework offers valuable guidance in streamlining AI governance while ensuring compliance with the PDPO and the principles of the Guidance. It is now an opportune moment for organisations to implement best practices on data governance and management.\n\nAccording to the 2023 Policy Address of the HKSAR government, a public consultation of AI legislation will be carried out within this year. Clearly, AI-related legislations will be in place sooner or later. Organisations are therefore urged to embrace increased scrutiny on the use of AI systems in the coming years, particularly when it involves the use or processing of personal data.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Privacy_Commissioner_for_Personal_Data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synthetic media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stewardship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hong_Kong", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Hong Kong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Best practice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

AI agents are systems designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Understanding AI agents involves dissecting their fundamental components: Conversation, Chain, and Agent. Each element is critical in how AI agents interact with their surroundings.\n\nConversation: The Interaction Mechanism\n\nThe conversation component is the interface through which AI agents communicate with users or other systems. This interaction mechanism is vital for AI agents' effectiveness, as it allows them to gather information, understand user intents, and provide relevant responses. Conversations can be text-based, voice-based, or both, depending on the application and context.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is the backbone of the conversation component. NLP enables AI agents to understand and generate human language, facilitating meaningful and coherent interactions. Techniques such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, & intent detection are employed to comprehend user inputs accurately. Advanced models like GPT-3 and BERT have significantly improved the conversational abilities of AI agents.\n\nThe conversation component often incorporates dialogue management systems that maintain the context of interactions, manage multi-turn dialogues, and ensure smooth transitions between different topics. This aspect is crucial for providing a seamless and engaging user experience.\n\nChain: The Workflow Organizer\n\nThe chain component, also known as the workflow organizer, structures the actions and decisions an AI agent undertakes to achieve its objectives. This component ensures that the agent's operations are logical, efficient, and aligned with its goals. The chain component can be visualized as a series of interconnected tasks, each contributing to the overall function of the AI agent.\n\nChains are often designed using decision trees, rule-based systems, or machine learning models that dictate actions based on specific conditions or inputs. For instance, in a customer service chatbot, the chain might include greeting the user, understanding their issue, retrieving relevant information from a database, and providing a solution or escalating the problem to a human representative. The chain component can incorporate feedback loops that allow the AI agent to learn from its interactions and improve over time. Reinforcement learning is a common technique used in this context, where the agent optimizes its actions based on rewards and penalties from its environment.\n\nAgent: The Autonomous Entity\n\nThe agent component is the core of an AI system, embodying the autonomous entity that perceives, decides, and acts. This component integrates the conversation and chain elements, enabling the AI agent to function as a cohesive unit. The agent is responsible for interpreting sensory inputs, making informed decisions, and executing actions that influence its environment.\n\nAI agents can be classified into various types based on their capabilities and functions. Reactive agents respond to specific stimuli without considering historical context, while deliberative agents maintain an internal state and plan their actions based on past experiences and future goals. Hybrid agents combine reactive and deliberative approaches, offering a balanced and flexible performance.\n\nThe architecture of the agent component often includes modules for perception, reasoning, and action. Perception involves gathering and processing data from the environment, reasoning encompasses decision-making processes based on predefined rules or learned models, and action consists of executing the chosen operations. Advanced AI agents also include elements of learning and adaptation, allowing them to evolve their strategies over time.\n\nConclusion\n\nUnderstanding AI agents requires comprehensively examining their main components: Conversation, Chain, and Agent. The conversation component facilitates meaningful interactions, the chain component organizes workflows and decision processes, and the agent component integrates these elements to act autonomously. As AI technology advances, AI agents' capabilities and applications are expected to expand, driving further innovation and transformation across various fields.", "source": {"uri": "marktechpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarkTechPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sana_hassan@marktechpost.com", "name": "Sana Hassan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sentiment analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BERT (language model)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule-based system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision tree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Control flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reinforcement learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Agents", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Agents", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-03-at-9.30.59-PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The DPDI was, among other things, designed to make the UK a more attractive place for the research and development (R&D) and deployment of AI technology. It would have also established new frameworks for smart data and digital ID. It will now be for the next government to decide whether to continue with the DPDI or take another path.\n\nTHE LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTO\n\nThe Labour Party manifesto is somewhat light touch regarding technology, AI, and privacy. However, the party has committed to long-term R&D budgets and to creating a new Regulatory Innovation Office in view of its belief that \"[r]egulators are currently ill-equipped to deal with the dramatic development of new technologies.\"\n\nData Privacy and Technological Innovation\n\nSurprisingly, the manifesto makes no reference to data protection reform, potentially signaling that reintroducing the DPDI Bill will not be on the agenda for a Labour government.\n\nIt does however set out Labour's plan for driving innovation:\n\n\"We will ensure our industrial strategy supports the development of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector [and] removes planning barriers to new datacentres. . . . [W]e will create a National Data Library to bring together existing research programmes and help deliver data-driven public services, whilst maintaining strong safeguards and ensuring all of the public benefit make reference to Data Centres.\"\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nThe Conservatives, adopting a so-called \"pro-innovation approach,\" expressly chose not to introduce AI-specific legislation on the lines of the EU's AI Act. They instead preferred to encourage regulators of existing laws (focused on data protection, competition, media and telecommunications, and financial services regulatory) to regulate AI by extending the reach of those laws, mostly without AI-specific statutory amendments.\n\nBy contrast, the Labour Party seeks to regulate AI through statutory footing by introducing \"binding regulation\" on the \"handful of companies developing the most powerful AI models.\" Importantly, this suggests that while the Labour Party does intend to introduce AI-specific legislation, this legislation will be more narrowly targeted. Notably, it will not go as far as the EU's AI Act, an omnibus, industry-agnostic, AI-specific law. Labour also intends to ban the creation of \"sexually explicit deepfakes.\"\n\nOverall, the Labour Party's approach could be a significant turning point for AI regulation in the UK with Labour having to walk a fine line between adequate regulation and promoting innovation.\n\nDatacentres\n\nIn a move that will also create potential benefits for AI, as well as the wider technology industry in the UK, Labour is committing to removing planning barriers for the development of datacentres and taking those planning decisions into central government. This will hopefully result in the development of many more datacentres on UK soil, in particular unused brownfield sites. This will be a welcome development for the hyperscalers as well as those technology companies that rely heavily on large datacentre processing power. It will likely also have a positive impact on data privacy, paving the way for more data localization within the UK.\n\nOther Technologies\n\nLabour is also committing to supporting other technologies, including open banking, open finance, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) technologies, but little detail is provided on what this will actually entail.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nRegardless of the result of the general election, technology, AI, and data privacy are key areas that the next government will have to address.\n\nClarity regarding AI regulation and updates to data privacy laws would be welcomed by many, particularly those businesses looking to innovate in a compliant and responsible manner.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Lords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental, social, and corporate governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_land", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brownfield land"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1078, "textEnd": 1084}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

In 2023, HKS created a Design Research Lead position for AI. This year, it has been formulating AI guidance policies. Image-generating AI informs the firm's design sketches. And its data warehouse -- which stores financial information that dates back 20 years and project info from the past half decade -- can now accept and integrate information from just about any source.\n\n\"AI provides us with a new way to discover information,\" said Cory Brugger, HKS's Chief Technology Officer. But HKS still isn't sure where AI is headed, or how its value proposition will equate to a competitive advantage. \"We knew we had to embrace the chaos, but we aren't convinced yet about the 'if' and 'where' of AI,\" said Brugger.\n\nAEC firms, in fact, should be thinking about AI as if it were a teenager, \"imperfect, but with potential, and requiring patience,\" said KD Reddy, founder of Shadow Ventures, a seed-stage investment firm.\n\nReddy, and Brugger (with Heath May, HKS's Global Practice Director), were among the presenters at the first-annual AEC Innovate conference. Hosted by PSMJ, the event was held last week in Boston and drew 230 executives from AEC firms across the country, a good number of which are already beyond just kicking AI's tires.\n\nConference attendees heard predictions about how AI would fundamentally change how they design, build, and operate. But speaker after speaker at the conference also tempered his or her advocacy with caution about AI's current limitations and risks.\n\nThe overriding message at the conference was that AI is evolving rapidly into a useful tool, but it isn't a panacea, and AEC firms need to be selective in choosing what tools they develop and for what tasks. While its capabilities are advancing at a scary pace, AI is not quite ready for the AEC world's prime time.\n\n\"The tech we use reasons by memorizing the world, not with semantic logic,\" said Phillip Bernstein, an Associate Dean and Professor at Yale University's School of Architecture, and author of Machine Learning: Architecture in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. \"Until tech reaches a point when it understands semantic detail, it will be hard to use for architecture.\"\n\nEven Autodesk, which has investigating AI for more than a decade -- and which in May added to its suite of AI-powered products a generative model called Bernini that produces 3D shapes from 2D images, texts, and point clouds -- concedes that \"we have a lot of work [to do] before we could go into production\" using this technology, said Racel Amour, Autodesk's Head of Generative AI.\n\nAt this moment in AI's evolution, the AEC industry is traveling on a \"digital journey\" that requires continuously adapting to change, said Brad Tushas, Vice President of Product Management for Deltek, whose software products include Deltek Dela, an AI-powered business companion that generates smart content and automates routine tasks.\n\nTushas said this journey is more accessible and satisfying when firms start small, identify use cases, begin with a goal in mind, and harness diverse talent. Tushas noted that the recent emergence of AI agents, which perform actions autonomous in an intelligent manner, are elevating Generative AI tech to new heights, particularly in the areas of content creation and analysis, and automating workflows.\n\nAnother keynote speaker, Medhi Mourbakhsh, COO of the technology consultant Yega Tech, saw AI agents as the keys to \"getting answers\" from content and images. \"This closes the technology divide,\" he exclaimed.\n\nThe conference gave attendees the opportunity to gauge their companies' progress with AI, vis-\u00e0-vis other firms. And based on the presentations and conversations with attendees, there's no lack of curiosity and experimentation.\n\nLast year, the AIA Large Firm Roundtable launched an Innovation Design Consortium, to which 40 of the Roundtable's 80 firms have committed $2 million. The purpose of IDC is to identify problems that are common to most AEC firms with the goal of jointly coming up with solutions. (There's been discussions about turning IDC into a subscription model.) One of the visions for IDC is to establish a data-sharing platform that IDC would organize and curate to serve as a data source for AI engines. The challenges to that endeavor include creating \"high fidelity\" data that, in the process, avoids \"hallucinations\" of erroneous or made-up information, explained Brad Lukanic, CEO of CannonDesign and an IDC board member.\n\nThe impetus behind IDC's formation, said Peter Devereaux, its chairman and the founding Principal of the global AE firm HED, is the race that AEC firms find themselves in trying to keep up with tech's trajectory. \"The next phase of venture capital is bunding [companies] in ways that are an existential threat to AEC firms,\" warned Devereaux, and he's not exaggerating: AI startups in the U.S., during the months of April through June, raised $56 billion from investors, up 57% from the same period in 2023, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups.\n\nOne of the more proactive AEC firms in the AI arena has been the engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti, whose research and development division CORE Studio has created AI-powered applications like T2D2, a tool for inspecting a building's structural integrity. T2D2 was recently used to inspect the Empire State Building, said Alexandra Pollock, AIA, CORE Studio's Senior Director, who presented at the conference with Seyedomid Sajedi, an AI/Machine Learning engineer. (One of Reddy's startup investments, Aren, also combines AI and civil engineering for infrastructure damage detection.)\n\nOther products created by Thornton Tomasetti include CORTEX, an AI/ML cloud structure; and Asterisk, which leverages ML for rapid assessment and delivery of structural solutions. During this presentation, Pollock and Sajedi showed an animation of a truss design abetted by Asterisk that was completed 50 times faster than it would have taken manually in 1995, and the new truss created was 5% lighter. They see for AI's future for AEC in, among other tasks, testing and validating designs, and marshalling institutional knowledge sharing, (Thornton Tomasetti has set up a \"community of practice\" for AI and a team channel for sharing ideas.)\n\nOther breakout sessions that a BD+C reporter sat in on during the conference were equally informative:\n\n*Frank Lazaro, a veteran executive and inventor, discussed the similarities and differences between Microsoft's AI personal assistant CoPilot and OpenAI's CHAT GPT. He said that while CoPilot's image generation is still \"behind the curve,\" he has found this tool to be useful for generating marketing pieces and proposals; one of its best features is its ability to create and rewrite copy. Lazaro also pointed out that Microsoft's strategy is to make CoPilot ubiquitous for any work-related device or platform a user prefers.\n\n*Niknaz Aftani is the founder of aec+tech, which tracks new tech product introductions. Her firm has identified more than 100 AI-powered tools on the market, which aec+tech breaks down into six categories: Planning to Programming (which would include Skema.AI for generative design BIM modeling), Schematic Design (which includes Laiout), Design Development (such as Augmenta for HVAC design), Construction Documents (such as VIM, Blueprints AI, CodeComply.AI, and Upcode), Construction (including the reality-capture tool Open Space), and AI tools developed in house, such as Gensler's viability tool for converting offices to residential, and DLR Group's spatial layout tool trained from 200 projects.\n\n*Ohio-based civil engineering firm The Kleingers Group is using AI improve its operational management, said Tim Casto, PE, its CEO and President. His presentation focused on how his firm benefits from using chatbots like CHAT GPT and Claude for such tasks as tracking trends in project manager compensation and profit margins. AI-powered software caught expenses that Kleingers' accounting department had overlooked. The firm uses chatbots to summarize personnel exit interviews, which led to the company \"digging deeper into what went wrong,\" said Casto. Kleingers has also downloaded the code ordinances of Milford, Ohio, so it could use GPT to answer code compliance questions.\n\n*The barriers to entry for using AI \"have never been lower,\" said Justin Webster, Chief Technology Officer for the global AEC firm HDR. \"But make sure you understand the capabilities and risks.\"\n\nWebster marveled at AI's capacity to help reduce the time it takes his firm to go from sketches to renderings to less than a minute, from 130 hours without AI that's been trained on previous projects. HDR has set up an AI task force internally to identify opportunities and challenges. He cautioned that AI's risks \"are real,\" and include IP protection, copyright infringement, data loss, the ethical use of data, validating and monitoring data accuracy, and bias detection.\n\nWebster observed that firms thinking about AI's role in their businesses first need to get their people on board by creating a culture where AI is \"safe\" to use experimentally, but where people, and not software or machines, are responsible for outcomes. Webster added that AI \"is all about the data,\" so companies must establish procedures that vet information, and make sure that data access is equitable. Companies need to weigh the pros and cons of whether to buy commercially available AI versus developing software on their own. They also need to establish standards and sharing protocols around data.\n\nFor AEC firms that are starting their AI journey, Webster recommended focusing initially on content summarization, semantic searches, content generation, and software development.\n\nDuring his presentation, Yega Tech's Nourbakhsh showed a split-screen video of LinkedIn's founder Reid Hoffman speaking with a remarkably life-like digital twin of himself whose audio was trained from Hoffman's speeches, podcasts and books, and created using voice-cloning software provided by Ukraine-based Respeecher.\n\nSometimes, AI's potential seems boundless. And this video is an entertaining illustration of AI's magic. But it also exposes the grandiosity and hype that make every advance in this technology sound like a major breakthrough and showstopper. Indeed, Bernstein, the Yale professor, quipped that a lot of what CHAT GPT is being used for today is \"interesting parlor tricks. Using CHAT GPT to write RFPs is a pretty low bar.\" The real work, he noted, lies ahead in software development and picking the right projects to apply AI to.\n\nThat might be easier said than done when, according to Nourbakhsh, at least 20% of the AEC industry people he speaks with remain skeptical about AI's functionality for their companies. And Reddy fretted that too many firms are using AI primarily for optimization, which in his estimation \"is a race to the bottom\" because the solution probably won't be proprietary and is less likely to provide a big payoff.\n\nReddy urged AEC firms to focus instead on using AI to boost productivity, specifically gross revenue per employee. He predicted that AI would eventually eliminate the need for middle managers who don't broaden their skill sets. Employees with creative skills, on the other hand, \"are not so easily replicated,\" and will be in even greater demand, especially by firms that evolve into what Reddy calls \"intangible enterprises\" with asymmetric business models, distinct brands, market leadership, infinite delivery services, cultural alchemy, and rapid product development.\n\nAEC firms, suggested several presenters, should not expect instant gratification from AI, whose mature use for the AEC industry is likely to take at least as long as Building Information Modeling did to gain mainstream acceptance. What's different now, said Nourbakhsh, is that tools exist today which allow AEC firms to create software specific to their needs, and, in essence, \"to become an AI company.\" Nourbakhsh also believed that the future belongs to \"subject-matter experts.\"\n\nBernstein said he's seeing more AI-related activity coming from construction firms than either architecture or engineering firms. He's also seen hints of AI being able to reason \"in 3D ways.\"\n\nThe greatest use of AI, so far at least, has been for analyzing data and wokrplace activities, said Bernstein. What AEC firms need to be asking, as they pursue AI as a strategy, is whether they have enough data, where that data comes from, how accurate is it, is it being used ethically, who's paying for it, and who's responsible for outcomes.\n\nUsing AI, he said, is best executed as a series of steps that starts with analysis and moves toward production, prediction, and finally provocation. Along the way, firms need to decide what's important and to \"get into the results business.\" That will entail creating a data infrastructure, adjusting their relationships with business partners, and shifting the value proposition of design.", "source": {"uri": "bdcnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Building Design + Construction"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Are these machines really intelligent or just crude imitations of our capabilities? Dr. Carlos Gershenson, researcher at the Institute for Research in Applied Mathematics and Systems (IIMAS) of UNAMoffers a deep perspective on this topic, exploring the different types of artificial intelligence (AI) and its scope.\n\nGershenson distinguishes different categories of AI, from software-based systems to physical robots. Some humanoid robots, while appearing to be imprecise imitations of animal abilities, perform specific tasks efficiently. However, AI is not limited to imitation. There are systems that use connectionist models, inspired by the functioning of the nervous system.and others that focus on the symbolic representation of knowledge and the management of logical rules.\n\nEach type of AI has its unique strengths and applicationsand it is not about determining which is superior, but rather about identifying the right tool for each task. \"When we force AI to replicate human behavior completely, the results are often inferior to when we use them to perform specific tasks,\" explains Gershenson.\n\nThe question of whether AI can have consciousness and feelings is controversial. Marvin Minsky, a pioneer in the field of AI, argues that intelligence does not necessarily require emotions, but that emotions can modulate behavior, both in animals and machines.\n\nSelf-awareness, however, the ability to reflect on oneself and one's place in the world, is a more complex issue. \"Perceptual awareness, the ability to sense the environment, is relatively easier to replicate in artificial systems,\" Gershenson says. \"Self-awareness, on the other hand, is harder to define even in humans, and even harder to replicate in machines.\"\n\nThe responses of the Google chatbot LaMDA, which expressed fear of death, do not represent a case of real awarenessaccording to the researcher. Chatbots, in general, are based on the generalization of patterns from training data. They are capable of simulating interesting conversations, but they do not possess a level of consciousness similar to that of humans.\n\nThe idea of AI taking over the world, as in science fiction movies, is more dystopian than realistic, according to Gershenson. The relationship between humans and technology is more of a symbiosis, a mutual dependence that has characterized our species from the use of language and fire to electricity and computers.\n\nThis dependence on technology will increase in the future, but so will our ability to control and direct it.\"Machines are not meant to do anything other than what we built them to do,\" Gershenson explains. A self-driving car doesn't have to rebel against its owner; it just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe Internet, computers, AI and other information and communication technologies give us \"superpowers,\" but they also standardize us and make us more dependent.limiting to some extent our capabilities and independence. However, this dependence also gives us greater security, stability and access to knowledge.\n\nSiri and Alexa are examples of automated assistants that facilitate interaction with computer systems using voice commands. In the future, these assistants could evolve to offer therapeutic support.\n\nNot only software assistants, but also robots, could help people with depression or autistic children. \"In countries like China, leaders in AI, this technology is being developed, while in Mexico we are just consumers,\" Gershenson reflects.\n\nThe future of AI presents challenges and opportunities. It is crucial to harness the potential of these tools to improve our lives without losing sight of the control and responsibility that we as humans must exercise over their development and application.\n\nUltimately, the question about artificial intelligence and its relationship to humanity does not have a simple answer.

It comes as nearly every sector is grappling with advances in AI and considering how the technology can increase productivity and profitability.\n\nWood has recently seen life insurance companies turn to AI to review 90-year-old policies and identity risks they could pose over the next decade or so when they are likely to be paid out.\n\nDoctors have also adopted the technology, using it to transcribe exchanges with patients and cobble together appointment summaries that are so accurate, blind-testing has shown health-care providers would choose them over human-crafted summaries seven out of 10 times.\n\nWood suspects regulated sectors have moved faster than others on AI for a few reasons.\n\nThe first stems from the trove of data at their fingertips.\n\nMany regulated companies are sitting on extensive databases, market research and development reports, clinical trial results and patient and insurance records that hold a lot of potential because the organizations are privately held.\n\n\"The models have never seen them before, and as a result, you can use generative AI to be able to understand, read, connect the dots, find similarities, find differences across these very large collections of data,\" Wood said.\n\nKnowing the data's value often also means understanding what it takes to protect it.\n\nSome AI systems, for example, collect, use and train on any data input into them but many companies have policies promising not to disclose or share customer or patient information.\n\nRegulated industries already know how to navigate these thorny issues in a way that won't stymie or block organizations from implementing technology, making AI adoption faster, Wood said.\n\n\"They've already figured out ... what data they have, what it can be used for, who it can be used by, what tools it can be used with, all those sorts of things,\" he said.\n\nThat understanding gives them a head start compared with other organizations who haven't confronted these issues before or who don't believe there's a way forward for them with AI.\n\n\"There is a kind of schism in some customers' minds that in order to be successful with generative AI, you have to make some sort of negative trade-off when it comes to the privacy of the data that you're using,\" said Wood.\n\n\"I can understand where that comes from. Some folks have played a little, shall we say, fast and loose with the data that has been available to them.\"\n\nBut Wood insists there are ways to balance privacy and potential.\n\nMany companies only use AI with anonymized or de-identified data, while others offer secure digital environments where staff can test AI without the fear of data leaking to the public or training future models.\n\nWood said AWS, Amazon's cloud-computing subsidiary, does not use data from paid corporate customers to train underlying models and also gives them full control over where their data resides, how it moves and what network it is on. The company also doesn't have internal or third-party staff reviewing their clients' prompts.\n\nThe speed with which they navigate data privacy aside, the final reason Wood thinks regulated businesses have rushed toward AI adoption is because they're keen not to be left behind by the latest technological whirlwind.\n\n\"They've had to sit on the sidelines a little bit as digital transformation has washed across other industries,\" he said, offering the example of how media and entertainment companies have been pushed ahead by streaming platforms.\n\n\"They're looking at generative AI not just as a way to kind of catch up, but as a way to leapfrog, significantly kick-start that digital transformation.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 4, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The AI also makes suggestions to improve the wording of written text, is available to answer work-related questions, and automatically updates everyone's work progress in a central portal.\n\nMr Rauma says that the shift towards an AI manager has not only reduced his stress levels, but has enabled his employees to work faster and be more productive. \"I'm able to focus on the growth of the company and all the positive things. It's added years to my life, I'm sure,\" he says.\n\nMr Rauma adds that his relationships with his employees have also improved drastically. \"Before, it felt a lot like a father-child situation. Now, we're more on an equal footing. Before, it was only about solving problems. But now we're able to have more light-hearted discussions.\"\n\nBut not everyone at Student Marketing Agency is using the AI manager yet. Mr Rauma and 26 of his 83 employees were actually part of a study run by Inspira and academics from Columbia University, Arizona State University, and the University of Wisconsin to compare the performance of the AI manager with its human counterparts.\n\nParticipants were divided into three groups: one coached by a human manager, another by the AI manager, and the last group by both AI and human manager.\n\nThe AI manager achieved a 44% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays in advance, and was able to motivate the employees to log in on time 42% of the time. These figures were comparable to the human manager, who achieved scores of 45% and 44% for those two areas.\n\nYet when the AI manager worked in partnership with a human manager, together they achieved a 72% success rate in getting employees to pre-plan their workdays, and managed to achieve 46% on-time success.\n\nDespite the study being statistically small, and concentrated on a specific type of worker and field, its results point to interesting implications for companies introducing AI tools.\n\nWhile businesses like UPS, Klarna, Dell and others have announced significant job cuts this year, with the intention of replacing many roles with AI, Prof Paul Thurman, from Columbia University in New York, argues that swapping management roles completely for AI would be a mistake.\n\n\"The middle management layer is the most critical layer in any organisation,\" says the professor of management. \"They're the layer that, if it starts turning over, you're in for a wild ride. Your people don't see continuity, they don't get mentoring and coaching... all the human things that human managers are better at than AI and should be focusing on.\"\n\nAI, Prof Thurman adds, can liberate managers from endless reminding and checking in, to focus on more innovative ways of working. For example, managers can cherry pick project teams based on individual skillsets, oversee the brief, then hand over to their AI to manage minutiae like deadlines.\n\nAI can also identify who in the team is falling behind and may need to be managed more closely by a human, and by the same token, hone in on star performers who require extra recognition.\n\nBut companies should steer away from AI managers becoming a surveillance tool, he says.\n\n\"You don't want to get to a point where you are noting that, not only do people not clock in on time, but they take too much time at lunch, and they're not eating enough salad. You don't want to go that far,\" says Prof Thurman. \"You want to find the right way to encourage the right behaviours.\"\n\nAI managers can also help people who have become \"accidental managers\" - people who excel in their roles and end up managing people as a result, despite management not being a natural skill for them, says Tina Rahman, founder of London-based HR consultancy, HR Habitat.\n\n\"We did a study which looked at the reasons people leave a job. Almost 100% of the respondents said it was because of bad management.\n\n\"Some of them said they didn't like the way they'd been managed, and most of them also said it was because they didn't know what was expected of them or if they were doing a good job,\" says Ms Rahman.\n\n\"You'd assume that an AI manager would be built to give those correct instructions, to give complete transparency on the requirements, and the outcomes. People are likely to be more productive when they know what's expected of them.\"\n\nBut an over-reliance on AI management sets the tone that companies only care about output and not people, Ms Rahman warns.\n\n\"It's going to be very hard for a business to tell their employees that they're introducing this brand new AI system that's going to completely manage them, then say, with the same face, that 'we care about your experiences in the workplace,'\" she says.\n\nYet perhaps the biggest concern about AI managers is not from a people perspective, but from a cybersecurity one, warns James Bore, managing director of cybersecurity consultancy, Bores, and speaker and author.\n\n\"If you have an AI manager, and you've given them all of the company's processes, procedures, and intellectual property that is suddenly all in the software, it can be kidnapped by someone who wants to clone it, and it could also be held to ransom,\" says Mr Bore.\n\n\"If you've come to rely on it, which companies will when they start replacing humans with AI, you're kind of stuck, because you've got no resilience, no option to switch back to the humans, because you don't have them anymore.\"\n\nRather than companies becoming more efficient through an extensive use of AI, Mr Bore says there could be an unintended consequence beyond becoming dependent on systems that could fail.\n\n\"The more you automate, and the more you remove people from your business, yes, you'll bring down costs. But you will also make your company more replaceable.\"", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rauma,_Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rauma, Finland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rauma, Finland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klarna", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klarna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mentorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Parcel Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ransom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human Resources", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Software", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Employment", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/abcd/live/62d70d30-3873-11ef-bdb3-a541449e903f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704530", "eventUri": "eng-9704530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 1}

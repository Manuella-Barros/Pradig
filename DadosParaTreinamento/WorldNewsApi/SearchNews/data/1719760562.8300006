Jim Murphy, R-St. Louis, said in an interview with The Center Square. \u201cIf anything, the city should be ashamed of themselves for spending $200,000 in taxpayer money to pursue an appeal that they were doomed to lose.\u201d The judges ruled against the group of taxpayers in their appeal of a lower-court ruling dismissing class-action status of the lawsuit, which could have cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds. \u201cThey should have done it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to try to do some type of legislation to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Murphy said. Last year, Murphy was chairman of a special committee investigating earnings taxes in St. Louis and Kansas City. He also sponsored House Bill 1516, which would have prohibited the city from collecting earnings taxes from remote workers. Murphy\u2019s bill would have created a process for taxpayers to receive a refund if earnings taxes were deducted for work or services not performed or rendered in the city currently or in the past. Democrat Mayor Tishaura Jones announced the lifting of a hiring freeze in the city earlier this month. She specifically mentioned her reason for ending it was Murphy\u2019s bill dying at the end of Missouri\u2019s legislative session. Jones and members of the Board of Aldermen expressed concerns about the impact on the city budget if the earnings tax on remote workers was determined to be illegal. \u201cThe City of St. Louis is reviewing the Missouri Court of Appeals\u2019 decision that was handed down today,\u201d Rasmus Jorgensen, deputy director of communications for Jones, wrote in an email to The Center Square. \u201cIn creating the 2025 budget proposal, the mayor took a financially prudent approach to take into account the potential impact of today\u2019s decision. We do not believe this decision will require changes to the budget or will impact the current level of city services.\u201d The judges consulted a dictionary to show how the city incorrectly applied \u201cplain and ordinary meanings of \u2018perform\u2019 and \u2018render,\u2019\u201d according to the ruling. \u201cAdditionally, this Court cannot ignore the remaining words in the Ordinance,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cSpecifically, the Ordinance\u2019s explicit condition that the earnings tax only applies to work done and services rendered or performed \u2018in the City.\u2019 Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines the preposition \u2018in as \u2018used as a function word to indicate location or position in space or in some materially bounded object.\u2019\u201d Murphy continually praised Kansas City during committee hearings for refunding earnings taxes collected from remote workers during the pandemic. \u201cKansas City made the right decision to begin with,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe law is so crystal clear as to what was right and wrong, and yet (City Collector) Gregory Daly decided he knew better than the law and he was going to do it his way. And all he did was waste taxpayer money and put citizens through a lot of trouble. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled with the court that they stood up for the citizens of Missouri. It\u2019s a great day for Missouri and the city gets what they deserve.\u201d The court also ruled against ordering the city to pay the attorneys\u2019 fees of the taxpayers who filed the lawsuit.", "summary": "(The Center Square) \u2013 The City of St. Louis violated state law when collecting income taxes on wages earned by remote workers, a three-judge panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals unanimously ruled on Tuesday. \u201cIt was the logical conclusion for the court to make,\u201d Rep.

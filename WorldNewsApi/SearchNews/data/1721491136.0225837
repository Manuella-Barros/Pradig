Organised Labour is having a running battle with both the federal and state governments over the new minimum wage. While the states are hesitant on N57,000, the Federal Government\u2019s negotiation team pegged discussions at N62,000 and submitted its report to President Bola Tinubu. The labour unions, however, insisted that the President must not send the N62,000 recommendation to the National Assembly as he promised during his Democracy Day broadcast, as they would not take anything below N250,000, considering the economic situation of the country. Speaking while hosting the Emir of Ilorin, Dr Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, at the annual Bareke in Ilorin, on Monday, AbdulRazaq, who is the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, said the state remained committed to the new national minimum wage and the consequential adjustments for higher cadres. \u201cA new national minimum wage is already in the works, along with the consequential adjustments for higher cadres. Kwara will not be left behind in this very important conversation,\u201d he said. AbdulRazaq said he was executing various infrastructural projects, agricultural programmes, and economic initiatives to improve the standing of the state. \u201cThis Sallah and before it, we have committed a lot of resources to support vulnerable households and many others across social strata. For sustainable growth and job creation, we are executing various infrastructural projects, agricultural programmes, and economic initiatives to improve the standing of our state,\u201d he said. The governor also assured Nigerians of brighter days ahead, following the ongoing reforms embarked upon by Tinubu. He, therefore, solicited continued support for Tinubu\u2019s administration, saying that the reforms would refocus the economy and achieve long-term sustainable growth for Nigeria. \u201cThe last year has been a period of determined economic reforms. These reforms are meant to refocus our economy and achieve long-term sustainable growth for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe acknowledge how the reforms have affected the purchasing powers of our people. We plead for patience, support, and understanding while different initiatives are designed to bring lasting ease to all. \u201cAs Allah says, ease is certain to follow a period of difficulties. There is hope on the horizon,\u201d he said. The governor applauded the Emir for his support for the administration and for turning the Ilorin Durbar into a national attraction. \u201cTomorrow is Durbar in Ilorin, just as we have some other sociocultural activities in different parts of our state. We thank our communities for reviving our culture. Your Royal Highness stands tall in this regard for how the Durbar is turning out to be a national attraction. \u201cI am glad that we have an environment that allows our culture to thrive. I urge our people to be peaceful and orderly as they troop out for these colourful cultural events, which are our heritage. \u201cI have approved that the Durbar be streamed live on Kwara TV and Radio Kwara (Midland FM and Kakaki FM), including their online platforms, so that everyone can see the beauty of this cultural event,\u201d he said. Accompanied by a retinue of titleholders and community leaders, the Emir commended the governor for his investments in human and infrastructural development of the state. \u201cI am proud of your political progression in the state and Nigeria, and I am delighted with your remarkable achievements in different sectors. I must say for your achievements, it is \u2018res ipsa loquitur\u2019. \u201cThe impacts of the governor could be felt in all spheres of development. In the governor\u2019s presence, I prayed to God to grant his second term ambition, because he did excellently well in the first tenure, and God answered the prayer. \u201cYou hardly sit in your office due to your commitments towards transforming the state. I am always proud of you, and Kwarans are proud of you. Kwara is witnessing development under your leadership. \u201cWhen he came to pay me an appreciation visit, he got a message that he has been appointed as the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and, within some minutes, he received another message that he has been nominated for the National Honour of Commander of Order of Niger. \u201cYour excellent performance speaks for you. You are a silent achiever, and your achievements are visible even to the blind,\u201d the traditional ruler said. He then urged the people of the state to continue to support the AbdulRazaq-led administration for progress and development. The event was attended by parliamentarians, cabinet members, bureaucrats, and titleholders and scholars, including Senator Saliu Mustapha; House of Representatives members, Mukhtar Shagaya, Ahmed Yinka Aluko and Ahmed Adam Saba; state House of Assembly members, led by the leader, Hon. Abdulkadir Magaji; Commissioner of Police, Victor Olaiya; top All Progressives Congress hierarchies, led by the State Chairman, Sunday Fagbemi and the clerics headed by the Chief Imam of Ilorin, Sheikh Mohammad Bashir Soliu.", "summary": "<p>The Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Monday, pledged that the state would not be left behind in the implementation of the new national minimum wage in the country.

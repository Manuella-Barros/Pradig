{"id": 223741284, "title": "Who Is &#8216;MultiVersus&#8217; For, Anyway?", "text": "Remember Space Jam: Legacy? You probably don\u2019t. It was an ill-advised sequel to 1996\u2019s commercial trash art classic, Space Jam. In the original film, global icon Michael Jordan is sucked into a cartoon world where he must assemble a team of Looney Tunes to play an intergalactic game of basketball against a squad of goons to save the universe. Legacy saw the same plot revisited, subbing in LeBron James for MJ, except being released in 2021, merely showcasing the Looney Tunes would not suffice. Instead, the movie functioned as a parade of scenes recreated from various Warner Bros. franchises \u2014 many of which today\u2019s children wouldn\u2019t just fail to recognize but are squarely directed at adults. One of the individual montages within the movie sees LeBron and Bugs Bunny doing the assembling-the-team bit, pulling Looney Tunes from disparate universes back together by diving directly into recreations of famous movie scenes (or flat-out scenes with the cartoons rotoscoped over). Elmer Fudd plays Verne Troyer\u2019s Mini-Me in a scene from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Foghorn Leghorn appears on a dragon\u2019s back, donning Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s blond wig as he flies through space with the Game of Thrones logo behind him. Wile E. Coyote brandishes knives amid the chaos of Mad Max: Fury Road, rotoscoped over a War Boy leaping to his death in a kamikaze blaze. It\u2019s fucking ridiculous. Warner Bros. Games\u2019 newest title, MultiVersus, is this concept in video game form. As a mascot brawler where the company\u2019s most recognizable characters are all pitted against each other to fight, it at least makes a bit more sense than a soulless movie mashup. Who doesn\u2019t want to play Velma beating the pompousness out of Bugs Bunny? What about boy scout Superman uppercutting Steven Universe into the stratosphere? Obviously, we\u2019ve all dreamed of Jason Voorhees slinging Arya Stark\u2019s wriggling body off a cliff in a sleeping bag. The thing about MultiVersus is that its IP-soup approach to gamifying brand awareness simply doesn\u2019t make any sense. Not logical sense \u2014 because who really cares why these characters are fighting \u2014 but thematic sense. Unlike Super Smash Bros. or Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, which also turn their biggest characters into mismatched action figures to slam together, MultiVersus\u2019 roster aims to draw in anyone who even remotely recognizes these characters, even though the game is clearly made for kids. Why are the game\u2019s references either drawn from adult-oriented media like Game of Thrones or movies like Gremlins, which are themselves twice the age of the target audience? A cartoon version of Friday the 13th\u2019s masked serial killer bloodlessly thwacking Rick and Morty isn\u2019t exactly worthy of a moral panic, but it is worthy of criticism. With a stable of IP that includes The Wizarding World, how did the youngest Stark daughter with a penchant for making people into meat pies make the cut before Harry Potter? There\u2019s an argument to be made that, despite being a full-on cartoon, the game isn\u2019t just for kids. But that\u2019s kind of bullshit. For one, it\u2019s free-to-play. While F2P games aren\u2019t a market exclusively for kids, it\u2019s a well-known tactic for attracting younger players who can access the game, then rack up in-game purchases for new characters and cosmetics. It\u2019s a business model that made games like Fortnite and Roblox into billion-dollar cash cows. And yes, Fortnite also trades in a slow drip of pop culture trends to continually draw players back over time, it, A) leans into modern media that kids actually get and, B) is genuinely made for all ages. Fortnite\u2019s colorful veneer belies a more complex game, with a high skill ceiling that\u2019s allowed it to become a global esport. MultiVersus, on the other hand, is too shallow of a game to appeal to adults long term. Let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s not a great game. A janky, clunky knock-off of Super Smash Bros., itself a children\u2019s game that also has the hidden depth to accommodate professional level competition, MultiVersus is very simple to pick-up, and never really gets any deeper. It\u2019s a button-masher that feels discount at every level; the kind of game you put on for your nieces and nephews over the holidays because it costs nothing and even drunk uncles who haven\u2019t gamed since ColecoVision can get in on the fun. And look, that\u2019s fine. At worst, a game like MultiVersus is innocuous. But by billing itself as a zany cross-dimensional extravaganza, it\u2019s veiling the fact that Warner Bros. Games are merely leaning into the worst impulses of modern entertainment by combining its two worst trends \u2014 multiverses and nostalgia farming \u2014 into one big trough. It\u2019s the video game equivalent of slapping together dinner from the remnants of the fridge because you\u2019re too tired to go to the store. It won\u2019t hurt you, it\u2019s just kind of sad. So, who is MultiVersus for? In an ideal world, no one. But seeing how many players sunk hundreds of dollars into the game during its initial open beta run in 2022 before the game went offline for over a year to be reworked, it\u2019ll likely be a hit for some. But we deserve better than this. Hell, Jason Voorhees deserves better than this.", "summary": "Warner Bros.

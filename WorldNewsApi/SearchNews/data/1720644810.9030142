The actor said that he has been told by many people that he should ease it on the hustle now that he has tasted success, but he doesn't look at it that way. Taha Shah said that if Heeramandi has taught him anything, it is to keep knocking on every door available and never get complacent with fame. Post the success of the show, Taha had also gone to Cannes. Talking about his experience in the film gala, Taha told Zoom that he was interacting with many people at Cannes, some who didn't know him at all. \"When they would find out I had done Heeramandi, they'd say, 'Ye itna bada kaam karke aaya hai, yaha pe kyu ghum raha hai?' Because they think if you become a star, people should come to you. I don't believe that, bro. Why should I cut away the things I did which brought me here? \"I hustle. If you don't say hello to me, I will come and do that. If 100 people know you, 95 will assume that you would have attitude after becoming successful, so they will never approach me with a script. So if you don't find me, I will. I tell my team I want to meet everyone, build my own personal relationship.\" The actor revealed at Cannes, he was \"distributing (his) card like a newcomer.\" Taha recalled telling people, \"'Please call me, get in touch,' I was going to all the stalls, meeting every film commissioner. It is not like they will help me get work tomorrow morning, but you never know. I don't mind missing my sleep or food when it comes to work. When I was at Cannes, I didn't eat. If you have to go for food, you have to take out one and a half to two hours, go out, order a meal, finish and come back. I either eat food or make contacts, I chose the latter. Food I can have later also.\" Taha Shah said his style of hustling hard hasn't shifted, and revealed how there was a time he would bribe watchmen of important personalities he wanted to meet. \"Earlier, when I would meet people, they would say, 'He is desperate, he doesn't leave you, he is obsessed.' But now, I will do it a thousand times over, because I know what I am doing is right. When I didn't have work, I'd meet the watchmen and say, 'Whenever sir comes, please call me'. I'd buy him a juice, drink or food, I'd pay him back a certain way but request him to please let me know so that I quickly meet people. So why should I stop that? If I want to meet someone, I will try. Of course, now it has become easier to have a meeting, but I have no ego,\" he added.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/taha-shah-badussha-says-he-skipped-meals-at-cannes-to-focus-on-networking-recalls-bribing-watchmen-with-juice-to-get-meeting-with-filmmakers-9380221/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/MixCollage-08-Jun-2024-06-58-PM-5908.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:31:44", "author": "Entertainment Desk", "authors": ["Entertainment Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.142}

The early results, reported by Iranian state television, did not initially put Jalili in a position to win Friday\u2019s election outright, potentially setting the stage for a runoff election. It also did not offer any turnout figures for the race yet - a crucial component of whether Iran\u2019s electorate backs its Shiite theocracy. Jalili had over 10 million votes, followed by Pezeshkian with 4.2 million. Another candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohmmad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.38 million votes. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 80,000 votes.", "summary": "Early results in Iran's presidential election put hard-liner Saeed Jalili ahead Saturday, followed by reformist Masoud Pezeshkian.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/saeed-jalili-leads-in-early-iran-presidential-elec/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/28/Iran_Election_67641.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:36:24", "author": "Iranian Students", "authors": ["Iranian Students"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.191}

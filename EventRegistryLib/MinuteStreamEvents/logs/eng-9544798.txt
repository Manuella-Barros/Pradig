E. Joseph Nyuma Boakai, Sr., for his official declaration, designating May as Red Cross Month and May 8 as Red Cross Day, a working holiday in Liberia.\n\nAs a signatory to the Geneva Convention, Liberia joins the global community in celebrating the spirit of humanitarianism under the theme: \"I give with joy, and the joy I give is a reward.\" The 2024 theme promotes the idea of giving with a sense of joy, recognizing that the joy experienced in the act of giving itself is a rewarding outcome.\n\nWorld Red Cross Day is observed globally on May 8 each year. The day is dedicated to those suffering from natural disasters, armed conflicts, and other crises. It also serves as an opportunity to highlight the humanitarian values upheld by the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n\nThe annual celebration commemorates the birth anniversary of Henry Dunant, the visionary founder of the Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). World Red Cross Day holds immense significance as it pays tribute to the humanitarian work undertaken by the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement across the globe.\n\nThe President's proclamation calls upon all civic and voluntary organizations and government agencies to actively get involved and support the Liberian Red Cross' programs and activities planned across the country to ensure a meaningful and rewarding May month celebration.\n\nFor over 105 years, the devoted volunteers of the Liberia National Red Cross Society have responded to challenges in various counties, districts, and communities with compassion and generosity. In times of disaster, they deliver humanitarian relief to save lives and offer hope to the needy while building community resilience, promoting humanitarian values, health and wellbeing, protection, gender, and inclusion, and addressing social contextual issues during normal time.\n\nIn a press release, the Secretary-General of the Liberian Red Cross Society, Gregory Blamoh, extended his appreciation to President Boakai for the recognition of the Red Cross' roles and activities.\n\nHe emphasized that the Red Cross remains neutral and will impartially offer hope and support when needed most, in all contexts, from large-scale disasters to challenging conflict situations to remote and hard-to-reach areas.\n\nThe Liberian Red Cross has outlined a series of activities, including membership recruitment, the donation of assorted relief materials to vulnerable people, training of students in first aid, free blood pressure monitoring, and environmental cleaning, as part of the May Month celebration.\n\nMr. Blamoh, a prominent figure within the Red Cross, extends an earnest invitation to all citizens to join the Red Cross in spreading kindness and compassion throughout the month of May and beyond, encouraging them to become members and actively support humanity.\n\nGlobally, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent touch the lives of one in every twelve individuals, offering a spectrum of assistance ranging from psychosocial support to disaster relief and fostering community resilience, a testament to their enduring impact and unwavering commitment to humanity's welfare.\n\nThe story of World Red Cross Day is one of compassion and action. It all starts with Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman who witnessed the horrors of the Battle of Solferino in Italy in 1859. Deeply moved by the suffering of wounded soldiers, Dunant took it upon himself to organize local people to care for them. This experience inspired him to write a book called \"A Memory of Solferino,\" which called for the creation of neutral organizations to provide aid during wartime.\n\nDunant's ideas gained momentum, leading to the formation of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1863. The ICRC, along with national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, has since become a global symbol of humanitarian aid.\n\nWorld Red Cross Day itself wasn't officially established until after World War II. In 1946, the idea of celebrating the birth anniversary of Henry Dunant, May 8th, as a day to honor the Red Cross Movement was put forward. Two years later, the first World Red Cross Day was celebrated.\n\nWorld Red Cross Day holds great significance for several reasons: Honoring Humanity- It's a day to recognize the selfless work of Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers and staff who risk their lives to help others during disasters, conflicts, and other emergencies, Spreading Awareness- The day serves as a platform to raise awareness about the vital role these organizations play in alleviating human suffering. From providing medical care and food to promoting peace and understanding, the Red Cross Movement touches countless lives, and Encouraging Action- World Red Cross Day inspires people to get involved in humanitarian work. Whether it's volunteering your time, donating blood, or simply spreading the word about the Red Cross mission, there are many ways to make a difference.\n\nIn conclusion, World Red Cross Day serves as a poignant reminder of our shared humanity and the importance of compassion, solidarity, and service to others. As we commemorate this day, let us reaffirm our commitment to promoting peace, alleviating suffering, and building a better future for all. United for humanity, we can make a difference.", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dunant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Henry Dunant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Conventions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compassion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_of_Solferino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Memory of Solferino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Solferino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood donation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 172, "textEnd": 177, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

He was the founder of (the ICRC) International Committee of the Red Cross and the recipient of the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901. World Red Cross Day: A Celebration of the Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.\n\nWorld Red Cross and Red Crescent Day encourages individuals, communities, governments, and organisations to engage with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through volunteering, donations, advocacy, or participation in humanitarian initiatives. In this article, let's learn more about the World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day 2024 date and the significance of the global event.\n\nWorld Red Cross and Red Crescent Day is annually observed on May 8. This year it falls on Wednesday. The World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day 2024 theme is yet to be disclosed; however, 2023's theme was #Fromtheheart.\n\nThe idea for an annual action that could take hold in the whole world and significantly contribute to peace was introduced just after World War I. This initiative, known as the 'Red Cross Truce', was studied by an International Commission established at the 14th International Conference of the Red Cross. The report was presented to the 15th International Conference of the Red Cross in Tokyo in 1934 and was approved. World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day Date & Significance: Know the History and Celebrations of The Day Honouring The Humanitarian Movement.\n\nAfter World War II, in 1946, Tokyo's proposal was studied by the League of Red Cross Societies (LRCS), renamed the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in 1991.

They also help communities prepare for future disasters.\"\n\nThe Red Cross operates four blood donation offices in Utah, and in St. George it is located at 476 E. Riverside Drive, Suite B-6. Hours are noon-6 p.m. Fridays and 8 a.m.-2 p.m. Mondays. Call 1-800-RED CROSS for more information.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study by the U.S. Census Bureau and AmeriCorps, about 23.2% of Americans, or over 60.7 million people, have formally volunteered through organizations, contributing an estimated 4.1 billion hours valued at $122.9 billion. In Utah, nearly 1 million residents volunteered in 2021, generating an economic value of $2.7 billion.\n\nThe Red Cross and Red Crescent network is active in nearly every country, often in areas of danger and under strife.\n\n\"We're a front-line humanitarian organization helping those most impacted by conflict and disaster,\" Ruster said. \"And we count on volunteers to carry out much of the work.\"\n\nIn recent years, humanitarian assistance has been provided in Ukraine to help those devastated by war and in Turkey and Syria, to help people recover from earthquakes.\n\n\"And also, in countries that have not received international media coverage, such as Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen and the Sahel Region of Africa - Red Cross and Red Crescent is there, too,\" Ruster said. \"But greater support is desperately needed to save lives and avert further suffering.\"\n\nTrained Red Cross of Utah volunteers and staff have deployed to every major disaster in the U.S., including flooding in California and Texas, tornadoes in Oklahoma and Kansas, wildfires in Hawaii and hurricanes in Florida and Puerto Rico.\n\n\"And our generous local volunteers last year responded to 250 home fires across the state, helping over 800 people in their time of need,\" Ruster said. \"The Red Cross needs more help, around the world and right here at home. World Red Cross Day can remind all of us to get involved.\"\n\nAcross the nation, over 275,000 Red Cross volunteers serve by responding to disasters, supporting blood collection for transfusions, assisting military families and preparing communities for emergencies, among other vital activities, the news release said. In Utah, over 1,500 volunteers supported Red Cross efforts in 2023.

He was born on 8 May 1828 in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nA bird's eye view of the founder of the Red Cross:\n\nJean-Henri Durant was the first recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize which he shared with Frederic Passy. He was instrumental in raising a movement for the formation of an international set of laws governing the treatment and nourishment of injured soldiers and prisoners of war.\n\nAs a relief activist, Henry was deeply devastated after witnessing fatalities caused during the Battle of Solferino in 1859, fought between French-Piedmontese and Austrian armies in the northern part of Italy. The visuals of this war made Durant write his book \"Memory of Solferino\" published in 1862.\n\nThe First Geneva Convention which laid out the fundamentals of humanitarian consideration for war wounded soldiers back on August 22, 1864, was deeply influenced by Durant's activities through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which he founded along with Swiss lawyer Gustav Moynier.\n\nRed Cross Day & its significance:\n\nPost World War II, the idea of celebrating; \"World Red Cross Day\" annually was adopted on 8 May 1948, on the birth anniversary of Henry Dunant.\n\nIn 1984, the day was formally named \"World Red Cross And Red Crescent Day\".\n\nThe primary objective behind the observation of Red Cross Day is to encourage and inspire people to engage themselves in humanitarian activities. The International Committee of The Red Cross even supports other charitable organisations to work for the betterment of victims of war, and natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, tsunamis and other similar situations.\n\nRegularly the organisation also promotes blood donation drives in collaboration with other institutions working in the health care sector as well as on its own.\n\nThe Red Cross Society works on seven fundamental principles, which are Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary Service, Unity, and Universality.\n\nThe organization empowers youths to participate in voluntary activities and help uplift people who are suffering due to war crimes, financial crises and health-related issues.\n\nThe theme for the celebration of \"World Red Cross Day and World Red Crescent Day 2024\" is \"I give with joy, and the joy I give is a reward.\"\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe celebration of World Red Cross Day serves as a reminder of human values, compassion, and empathy people have towards each other. It also acts as a medium to promote values of selfless service, mutual respect and universal equality.", "source": {"uri": "ommcomnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ommcom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Solferino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dunant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Dunant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Geneva_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Geneva Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compassion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tsunami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood donation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://ommcomnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/World-Redcross-Day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 61, "textEnd": 66}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It honours the birth anniversary of Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman and the founder of the Red Cross, the world's largest humanitarian aid organisation. He was the founder of (ICRC) International Committee of the Red Cross and the recipient of the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.\n\nDunant was the first Nobel Peace Prize winner. The Red Cross supports those in need during emergencies and conflicts. On the World Red Cross Day volunteers promote the mission and principles of the 161-year-old international aid organisation which has national chapters in 192 countries.\n\nWorld Red Cross Day traces its roots to 1859 after Swiss businessman Henry Dunant was deeply moved by the lack of treatment given to soldiers and civilians at the Battle of Solferino in Italy. A few years later, in 1863, Dunant organised volunteer-supported relief societies that committed to providing non-partisan help to the wounded during wartime or conflict.\n\nThe same year, Dunant and five colleagues established the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, which evolved into the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nThe aid organisation soon became popular as simply Red Cross, after its emblem which was inspired by the Swiss National flag. In World War I and World War II, the Red Cross played an important role in aiding injured civilians and prisoners of war. Today it has many local and national chapters across the globe.\n\nThe Red Cross's significance in the world of human rights is enormous. The non-profit's motto \"Per Humanitatem ad Pacem\", which means \"With humanity, towards peace\", espouses the message of world peace. The organisation is active in conflict zones or sites of natural disasters.\n\nIt is credited with codifying the Geneva Conventions, a four-point treaty, about how soldiers and civilians should be treated during war. All 196 countries in the world have ratified the four Geneva Conventions.\n\nAs per Geneva Conventions: all civilians, even those in occupied territory should be protected; prisoners of war must be treated with humanity; sick, wounded, medical and religious personnel should not be attacked during conflict; those wounded, sick, and shipwrecked during war at sea should be protected.\n\nThe theme for World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day in 2024 is \"I give with joy, and the joy I give is a reward\". The theme encourages the joy of charity and service.\n\nMany national and local chapters of the Red Cross commemorate World Red Cross Day by organising special events and activities like running blood donation drives, giving first aid training sessions, hosting fundraisers, public awareness campaigns, and honouring outstanding volunteers and humanitarian achievements of individuals and groups.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dunant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Dunant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Conventions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Solferino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/world-red-cross-day-2024-2024-05-e822c2f86b595417948e021f3c817be4-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 276, "textEnd": 281}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He emphasized that the Red Cross remains neutral and will impartially offer hope and support when needed most, in all contexts, from large-scale disasters to challenging conflict situations, and to remote and hard-to-reach areas.\n\nThe Liberian Red Cross has outlined a series of activities including membership recruitment, donation of assorted relief materials to vulnerable people, training of students in First Aid, free blood pressure monitoring, and environmental cleaning as part of the May Month celebration.\n\nMr. Blamoh encourages everyone to join the Red Cross in spreading kindness and compassion throughout the month of May and beyond, as well as becoming a member to support humanity.\n\nAround the world, one in every 12 people receives some form of help from the Red Cross or Red Crescent - from in-person psychosocial support to relief assistance in times of disasters, and building community resilience, which has been truly remarkable.", "source": {"uri": "frontpageafricaonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Page Africa"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Conventions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monrovia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monrovia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compassion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://frontpageafricaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/red-cross.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monrovia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 168, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": 0.7176470588235293, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Matt Trotter from the Red Cross joined us to share more about the resources available.\n\nThe American Red Cross has shelters open and is providing relief to those impacted by our recent storms.\n\nMatt Trotter from the Red Cross joined us on Six In The Morning to share more about the resources available.\n\nCLICK HERE to learn more about the Red Cross tornado response and how you can give and receive help.\n\nAbout how many people are using shelters after tornadoes came through Oklahoma?\n\n\"We still have a few folks in our shelter in Sulphur after those April 27 tornadoes. And we have about a dozen people in our shelter in Osage County right now. That's more than we had on the first night. And it's typical that we see additional folks come into the shelter after a day or two after disaster just because it takes people sometimes a day or two to figure out their bearings, understand if they have somewhere to go long term, or if they really need the Red Cross shelter.\"\n\nWhat is the Red Cross in need of right now?\n\n\"For the Red Cross, our biggest needs are financial donations and volunteer power. Those are the two things that really make our mission possible to provide care and comfort to people after a disaster like this. So we're encouraging people, if they want to volunteer go to redcross.org/volunteer. We do have an expedited process for some folks who may be able to help us with sheltering and other on the ground operations that we do, and redcross.org/donate to support disaster relief financially. You know, these big responses across an entire state don't happen without people's support. We don't receive much in the way of public funding. Most of our mission is supported by financial donors, just like your viewers.\"\n\nWhat are some resources that are available to folks who are affected by storms?\n\n\"So in Red Cross shelters, obviously, you can stay overnight. It's a safe place to sleep. But we have lots of other things that we provide people there as well. We have nurses who provide health services, can help you replace lost medical items or prescriptions. Even if you lost your glasses, we can help people find a new pair. We have mental health services and emotional support. We have spiritual care, which essentially are chaplains that can help people who are in need of some spiritual guidance during a disaster. And we can help people with recovery referrals to other community organizations. So not just things that the Red Cross does, but other services in your area that you may not know about. And I think what people don't understand sometimes is you don't have to stay in a Red Cross shelter to get all of those services. And that includes meals and snacks and water. You can stop by to get whatever you need. And if you have somewhere else to stay, that's great. You can go there. Everything at the Red Cross that we have to help you is free. We offer our services to anybody. And again, you don't have to stay in the shelter to get the resources and assistance that we offer there.\"", "source": {"uri": "newson6.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News On 6"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_media@newson6.com", "name": "Griffin Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sulphur, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sulphur, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_County,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Osage County, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osage County, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://hot-town-images.s3.amazonaws.com/kotv/production/2023/September/20/american-red-cross.1695214961486.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 664, "textEnd": 672}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It is a day when we honour the legacy of Henry Dunant, the pioneering volunteer who founded the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement more than 160 years ago. Above all, today is a day that we pay tribute to the millions of volunteers and staff working alongside people in need of protection, assistance, healthcare, social aid and solidarity.\n\nAmid armed conflicts and violence, disasters, climate-related crises, epidemics, food insecurity and mass displacements in some of the world's most vulnerable situations, our commitment to helping others remains strong. In these challenging times, the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems we wear are powerful symbols promising protection to people in need. Their universal recognition is crucial to help protect volunteers and staff worldwide as they carry out their life-saving work. Upholding neutral and impartial humanitarian action is paramount and allows our teams to access the most remote, at-risk communities in crisis.\n\nWith so many global challenges competing for attention and resources, we are committed to shining a light on and addressing the forgotten crises around the world. In a time of polarization and the dehumanization of various groups, including migrants, neighbouring communities, and even first aid workers, our Movement reinforces the basic principle of humanity, especially in the places where it is most essential to keeping Humanity alive.\n\nRespect for international humanitarian law not only preserves the humanity of people affected by crises, it preserves our own humanity - both today and in the future. Upholding international humanitarian law reflects the Movement's core values and is essential for ensuring the well-being and dignity of all people in need.\n\nRed Cross and Red Crescent volunteers and staff are often the first to respond to to a crisis or disaster. From the most remote corners of the globe and the most challenging contexts, our volunteers and staff are pillars of hope. Every day, they keep humanity alive, providing comfort to people in desperate need - sometimes paying the highest price in the process. This World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day, we honour their service, bravery and sacrifice.\n\nBeyond borders and amidst our diverse backgrounds, the unity of our Movement lies in our shared commitment to humanitarian action. Our work is rooted in the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence. Even in the darkest moments, every act of kindness is a beacon of hope, promising a brighter tomorrow.\n\nOn this day, we fondly remember our colleagues who have died while supporting our humanitarian mission and extend our deepest condolences to their loved ones. We also have immense gratitude to all Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers and staff for their unwavering dedication.", "source": {"uri": "icrc.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emblems_of_the_International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dunant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Dunant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartiality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impartiality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/styles/meta_image/public/document_new/image/2024-wrcrc-collage-card-sq-en_web.jpg?itok=lx6fL0OV", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 8}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

This type of assistance is damage-based.\n\nTo be eligible for Red Cross damage-based financial assistance, households apply for the program and meet the following three requirements:\n\nTheir pre-disaster primary residence (renter or homeowner) is in a confirmed disaster-impacted geographic area.\n\nTheir head of household is able to provide proof of identity and residence.\n\nTheir primary residence is assessed to be destroyed or has suffered significant structural damage that requires extensive repairs. A residence that is destroyed is one that is a total loss or with damage so severe that repairs are not feasible.\n\nMany qualifying households will receive an invitation to complete an application through an email, text message or phone call directly from the American Red Cross. Please follow the instructions in the message and call 1-800-RED CROSS (800-733-2767) to enroll, confirm eligibility and receive individual financial assistance.\n\nThe phone number the text message comes from may vary.\n\nEmails will come from \"American Red Cross\" from clientservices@rccare.redcross.org.\n\nThe Red Cross also assists those who may face barriers to accessing disaster assistance such as people who do not speak English, are not American citizens, or who have not responded to our initial outreach.\n\nAnyone who needs assistance is welcome to call 1-800-RED CROSS.", "source": {"uri": "kfor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KFOR 4 Oklahoma City"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terre_gables@kfor.com", "name": "Terr\u00e9 Gables", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osage_Nation", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Osage Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Plains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Identity document"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://kfor.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/american-red-cross.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 269, "textEnd": 277}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1291}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The unique global network of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has worked for more than a century to help and support such families. The messages of family reunification broadcast through the RFL program may be short, but three short words -- I'm alive -- can mean the world to a family in distress.\n\nChristine, recently retired from the technology industry after 40 years in marketing and partnerships, serves as the Red Cross division manager for the RFL program, where she oversees affairs and outreach for seven states in the continental US and the Pacific Islands. In addition to her leadership within the program, she is also an active outreach worker and specialized mentor.\n\nI love what I do at the Red Cross, said Christine. The Red Cross is helping to protect and keep families whole, and I'm glad to be part of a service that's been around for over 100 years.\n\nWhen caseworkers like Christine and Hawley receive requests from people looking for family members or loved ones, they get right to work, making phone calls and working with the global network to track down family members, sometimes separated in years and thousands of miles. Once the Red Cross network finds the person they are looking for, caseworkers share contact information to facilitate communication. In some cases, the Red Cross can also help with personal reunification of loved ones.\n\nHawley, a retired mathematician with a knack for research and algorithm development, is the longest-serving RFL caseworker in the American Red Cross' Northern California Coastal Region. Hawley has an incredible body of knowledge having worked on many challenging RFL cases and helping hundreds of people since he started with the program in 2009. He also provides invaluable mentoring to RFL colleagues.\n\nI enjoy helping someone, whether it's bringing their case to a successful or unsuccessful conclusion, or providing a reference, he said.\n\nTo honor the exceptional service provided by RFL Caseworkers, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement awards a Movement Family Links Medal to five recipients globally every two years. This year, Christine and Hawley were both nominated as medal candidates for their dedication to families near and far, and for finding innovative and creative ways to overcome obstacles and provide services to those who need them.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German reunification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mentorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/about-us/news/2024/2024wrcrccollagecardsqen.png.img.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 46, "textEnd": 51}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

However, he underscored that unless the origins of the disease are dealt with thoroughly, like water, air and soil pollution, unclean drains and garbage dumps, etc., the epidemic will keep breaking out.\n\nHe said this is one of the most important realities all societies with dreams and aspirations have to understand and accept the changes required as normal thinking and living.\n\nComing to our society, Iralu said, \"unless each one of us accepts our duty and responsibility to do what we do excellently and properly as we know all Christians, Hindu, Muslims etc., should whatever our job and place of work may be, our society is collapsing into a black hole created by all of us.\"\n\nIralu asserted that today's theme, \"Keeping humanity alive,\" goes to the deeper need Henry Dunant, the founder of Red Cross Society saw before he died. \"He saw the need for the Red Cross Movement to become a movement that would also heal the hurts and hates, fears, greed and want of power at all costs not just one that addressed the sufferings of the human body and material destruction.\"\n\nSpeaking on the important role of Red Cross, Iralu said 'from all that we are seeing, hearing and experiencing of conflict situations going out of control in all continents, we know how important the effectiveness of the Red Cross Society and movement is for our world in peril.'\n\nThe official theme of the Red Cross Society globally, \"Through humanity to peace\" and the theme this year, Keeping humanity alive, in their entirety, points towards achieving peace and keeping humanity alive by stopping all that lead to killings.\n\nSpeaking on the theme, Dr R Rose Chakhesang, MC member IRCSN said that humanity is still alive and called upon the people to love each other with compassionate heart and kindness, support the needy. He also reminded them to practice the core humanity values and kept humanity alive till their life.\n\nA DIPR report added that General Secretary IRCSN Akhale V Khamo delivered the Secretary General's Message.

It was founded in 1885 and admitted to the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in 1922. It serves as an auxiliary to public authorities in the humanitarian field, assisting them impartially and independently, and serving the most vulnerable people.\n\nThrough its 111 branches, 13 office stations, and 9 regional branches, the Costa Rican Red Cross develops emergency response due to disasters, pre-hospital care, community risk reduction, providing temporary shelters, and other avenues of humanitarian aid. The operating model is based on the collaboration of volunteers with roots in the community, the activities that define their auxiliary role with the State in the humanitarian field, proximity to the people with whom we collaborate and their national and global networks of solidarity. In 2021, the Costa Rican Red Cross reached more than 16,000 people through its disaster response and early recovery programmes.\n\nAccording to the Costa Rican Red Cross' Strategic Plan 2021-2030, the National Society has three strategic axes: humanitarian, inclusive, and open and transparent. The main function of the Strategic Plan is to motivate and manage the institution to become a resilient and innovative humanitarian organization which provides an efficient and effective response to all populations, sectors and communities.\n\nThe Humanitarian Red Cross axis exists to save lives and provide recovery support after disasters and crises. It aims to build safe and resilient environments through risk management, emergency care, and attention to the most vulnerable populations, sectors, and communities.

Society marks World Red Cross Day with school outreach", "body": "The Upper West Regional Branch of the Ghana Red Cross Society (GRCS) has commemorated World Red Cross Day with a school outreach at Fongo M/A Junior High School in Wa.\n\nThe event aimed to sensitize pupils about the Red Cross/Red Crescent Societies and revitalize interest in the organization among the student population and the general public.\n\nThe outreach program featured a range of topics, including climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability, disease control, volunteerism, and disaster management.\n\nVarious team members took turns to engage the pupils, providing valuable insights and practical tips on critical issues about the topics, interspersed with interactive sessions on emergency response and community service.\n\nMadam Maria Johana Yuorpor, the Upper West Regional Chairperson of the GRCS, emphasized the importance of revamping the Red Cross movement, which has seemingly faded from the eyes and minds of people.\n\nShe stressed the need to imbue the spirit of volunteerism in youngsters, encouraging them to become active participants in their communities.\n\n\"We want to inspire the next generation of leaders and volunteers, and empower them to make a positive impact in their communities,\" she said.\n\nMadam Yuorpor said marking World Red Cross Day with the school outreach reaffirmed the Upper West Regional Branch of the GRCS commitment to serving humanity and promoting a safer and more resilient community for all.\n\nMr. Abdul Rauf Issahaku, a member of the GRCS, who delivered a presentation on disaster readiness, preparedness, and mitigation, urged the pupils to contribute in their small ways to avoid disasters, both natural and artificial, particularly floods and fires.\n\n\"Disaster prevention and preparedness start with individual actions, and we want to equip you with the knowledge and skills to make a difference,\" he emphasized.\n\nHe said disasters disrupt society's functioning and thus, it was important for community members to take steps towards disaster prevention such as desilting gutters and not building in waterways to prevent floods.\n\nThe event served as a platform to educate and inspire the next generation of leaders and volunteers, fostering a culture of compassion, empathy, and community service in line with the Red Cross/Red Crescent's values of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality.\n\nSome of the pupils who participated in the sensitization expressed happiness about the knowledge that was shared with and pledged to become active volunteers in their community.\n\n\"I learnt about being volunteering to do something willingly without being asked to dot or taking anything [in the form of reward] from someone.\n\n\"You can clean gutters without anyone asking you to do, you can clean your school compound without a teacher asking you to do, clean your environment, [and] attend community activities,\" a pupil, Mutimainat Iddrisu said.\n\nThe theme for this year's World Red Cross Day celebration was, \"I give with joy, and the joy I give is a reward.\"", "source": {"uri": "modernghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Currently, EF3 damage has been found southwest of Barnsdall. Still a long day of surveying with this storm and lots more to evaluate.\"\n\nTrained Red Cross disaster workers are operating shelters in affected areas:\n\nThe Red Cross confirmed they are working with local officials in newly impacted areas to understand and help meet community needs from now through residents' recovery.\n\nAnyone affected by this disaster is welcome at a Red Cross shelter.

Do not use gasoline, propane, natural gas or charcoal-burning devices inside a home, basement, garage, tent or camper -- or even outside near an open window. Carbon monoxide can't be seen or smelled, but it can kill you fast. If you start to feel sick, dizzy or weak, get to fresh air right away -- do not delay.\n\nTake care of yourself\n\nIt's normal to have a lot of bad feelings, stress, or anxiety.\n\nEat healthy food and get enough sleep to help you deal with stress.\n\nYou can contact the national SAMHSA Disaster Distress Helpline for free if you need to talk to someone.

These historical documents, including prisoner letters, were translated into modern Turkish and curated into an exhibition through the efforts of the Presidency's Directorate of Communication and contributions from TRT.\n\nThe exhibition was attended by Murat Ellialt\u0131, deputy secretary-general of the Turkish Red Crescent, officials from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), representatives from diplomatic missions, and various guests.\n\nEllialt\u0131 emphasized the historical significance of the Red Crescent and Red Cross, stating: \"The Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, serving as both the first organized global movement and the inaugural humanitarian movement of modern times, stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of global humanitarianism. Despite the warrior spirit accumulated by humanity over the centuries, many good people from various countries came together to establish this voluntary movement 150 years ago. Another characteristic of this movement is that it is based on voluntarism. Good people from different geographies, believing in different things, belonging to different religions and colors, came together through this movement.\"\n\nEllialt\u0131 further highlighted the role of the Red Crescent during World War I, stating, \"Today holds another significance as we showcase centuries-old entrusted prisoner letters in this venue. During World War I, those who fell captive to enemy countries, unable to receive news from their families, wrote letters to the Red Crescent at that time, namely the Hilal-i Ahmer Prisoners Commission, providing information about their conditions and requesting information from their families, urging them to reach out to them through the Red Crescent.\"\n\nHe also mentioned the emotional content of the letters, stating: \"There are beautiful stories written in a very refined Turkish. One such letter, authored by a grieving mother, poignantly expresses her anguish as she seeks news of her captured son, beseeching for any information to be relayed to him. There are also letters from soldiers written in exquisite Turkish. They carry the spirit of that time to the present day.\"\n\nLikewise, the letters written by soldiers echo with deep longing and resilience; their eloquent Turkish prose surpasses the confines of time, evoking the lasting human relationships formed amid the chaos of war. These correspondences not only recount past challenges but also emphasize the enduring significance of family ties and hope during difficult times.\n\nThe event not only commemorated World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day but also served as a poignant reminder of the enduring humanitarian efforts of these organizations throughout history.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daily_sabah@dailysabah.com", "name": "Daily Sabah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Red_Crescent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turkish Red Crescent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_of_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Societies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galataport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galataport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in Turkey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karak\u00f6y", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karak\u00f6y"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karak\u00f6y"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volunteering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/05/09/thumbs/800x531/327098.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

NGOZI EGENUKA reports that humanitarian services, which the Red Cross provides during emergencies are being stretched beyond capacity in the midst of this escalating crisis.\n\nThere are at least 13 raging conflicts in the world, besides varying degrees of humanitarian crisis occasioned by natural disasters like flooding, famine, earthquakes and hunger.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war alone has led to the death of over 10,000 civilians since February 24, 2022. Two years of full-scale invasion have displaced almost 10 million Ukrainians and left approximately one-third of the population in need of humanitarian support inside the country.\n\nReports show that in 2024, 14.6 million Ukrainians, including 3.7 million who are internally displaced will need humanitarian assistance. About one third of this population, including 1.5 million children, are grappling with mental health issues, suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nSince the inception of the Israel-Gaza war, at least 35,200 (14,000 children and 9,000 women) have died, 10,000 missing and presumed trapped under rubble and almost all of the strip's 2.3 million population has been internally displaced.\n\nIsrael reportedly cut off food, water and medicine. Also, its attacks on infrastructure have led to a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, including a collapse of the healthcare system and an ongoing famine.\n\nSudan's internal conflict, which started in April 2023, has led to the displacement of more than 8 million people, the largest in the world and the deaths of over 14,700 others\n\nAlready, hundreds of people have died around the world from flooding within two weeks and according to the latest Global Report on Food Crises, more than one in five people in 59 countries faced acute food insecurity in 2023.\n\nImmense humanitarian needs persist as the crisis continues to displace civilians and reduce access to education, economic opportunities, health care, food security, and gender equality. The ravages of war have shattered support networks, leaving a staggering impact.\n\nMore than ever, the world is in desperate need of humanitarian services. Humanitarian organisations are spread thinly trying to manage these issues. There are, however, concerns that humans are unable to provide needed or sufficient care for each other with the evolving world dynamics and focus. This is visible in the reduced attention given to education or issues around humanitarian values.\n\nRCRC Day, which is commemorated every May 8, focuses on people who are suffering from various natural calamities, armed conflicts, and other crises; it becomes expedient to emphasise the importance of humanitarian values.\n\nSenior Media Officer, Media Relations, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Andrew Thomas, confirmed to The Guardian that there are 78 active Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) Operations (ones that have received a grant from the IFRC's Disaster Response Emergency Fund) and a further 28 emergencies that the IFRC is raising money for through emergency appeals. So, there are a total of 106 responses that the IFRC is 'involved' with.\n\nHe added, however, that all 191 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies work on projects year round. Most are funded through those national societies' regular income.\n\n\"The overall number of responses of all Red Cross/Red Crescent societies though will be much higher - in the hundreds. We don't have a number,\" he added. According to him, the overall operations the IFRC is 'involved' with in a financial sense targets 63.5 million people in need of help. Though the overall number of people helped by the hundreds of Red Cross and Red Crescent activities is much higher, it runs into hundreds of millions.\n\n\"Some of the issues our network deals with affect billions (half the world's population). For example, we experienced at least one episode of extreme heat last year, something that our network has prioritised as a crisis to address.\n\nOn recommendations in curbing the crisis and saving humanity, he said it is the theme for this year's RCRC Day, \"Keeping humanity alive\", because regardless of the crisis, people must focus on their shared humanity.\n\nAccording to reports, over the last 10 years, IFRC has funded three emergency appeals with $4,585,880.7, which targeted 4,036,000 people. For 45 DREFs, $15,610,699 has been used to fund 3,572,045 people. To effectively provide services to people in crisis areas, IFRC requires trillions of dollars.\n\nIn a statement signed by IFRC President, Kate Forbes; Standing Commission Chair, Mercedes Bab\u00e9 and President, International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, there are so many global challenges competing for attention and resources. The body said it is committed to shining a light on and addressing the forgotten crises around the world.\n\n\"In a time of polarisation and the dehumanisation of various groups, including migrants, neighbouring communities, and even first aid workers, our movement reinforces the basic principle of humanity, especially in the places where it is most essential to keeping humanity alive,\" it said.\n\nAccording to the statement, respect for international humanitarian law not only preserves the humanity of people affected by crises, it preserves our own humanity, both today and in the future.\n\nUpholding international humanitarian law, the statement said, reflects the Movement's core values and is essential for ensuring the well-being and dignity of all people in need.\n\nProffering solutions to prevalence of humanitarian crisis, Dean, Faculty of Social Sciences, Lagos State University Prof. Olufemi Lawal, noted that economic and political crisis deters humanitarian service providers from functioning maximally, while stating that the number of humanitarian groups in this part of the world are smaller and this is as a result of the weight of the crisis.\n\nHe said that the groups are mostly hindered by low funding and the government does little to contribute as in the war zones, where needs tend to overwhelm resources. He condemned the government's lack of attention to these groups.\n\nCiting the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and the risks attached to humanitarian services, he urged the government, \"to weigh in and see humanitarian service as a priority and make sure to invest in it, particularly in this part of the world where philanthropy is not common.\"\n\nLawal stated that crises are inevitable but can be managed. However, he noted that the perception of social justice/injustice engenders conflict.\n\nHe urged world leaders to cultivate sincerity, saying, \"when they come to the realisation that conflict can only be reduced, not stopped, they can stand against conflict and seek measures to curb it around the world.\"\n\nActing Director, Research and Studies Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Dr Efem Ubi, urged governments to do the right thing, alluding that if there is no justice or development there cannot be peace.''\n\n\"Every country's government must put the right processes, structures, policies, reforms and institutions that would bring people together and create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive and for investors to come in,\" he said.\n\nHe noted the argument that all crises are not based on the economy, but said it has a major role to play. He, however, stated that multilateralism is the solution as insecurity or crisis cannot be mitigated by just one country. He also emphasised the importance of orientation through education and parental guidance in enhancing humanitarian services.\n\n\"There is a need to inculcate values and morality into the younger generation, which are the right values that would enable them to contribute positively to the society,\" he added.\n\nThe Executive Director, Nigerian Networks of Non-Governmental Organisations (NNNGOS), Oyebisi Oluseyi, said that flexibility and unity of all systems, sectors and people is an efficient way to tackle global crises.\n\n\"Our world is facing a growing number of emergencies that are linked together, creating a complex and dangerous situation. These \"polycrises\" threaten people's lives, basic needs, and sense of self. To overcome these challenges, we need everyone to work together.\n\n\"This means governments, aid organisations, local communities, and individuals all playing their part. But our responses can't be one-size-fits-all. We need to be flexible and adapt our efforts as situations change. Most importantly, the root causes of these crises must be identified, not just dealing with the immediate problems,\" he said. He emphasised the need to involve local people in decision-making, using technology for faster and more targeted assistance, and base actions on data.\n\n\"But we can't forget the basic needs, keeping people safe, protecting them from harm, and making sure there's enough funding to get things done.\n\n\"Working together openly, honestly, and with everyone involved (collaboration, accountability, transparency, and inclusivity) is also key. Mental health and well-being need to be a priority as well.\n\n\"Ultimately, we need a major change in how we approach these problems. We need to move from simply reacting to crises to working together in a way that's long-lasting and builds resilience in affected communities. This means putting people's dignity and their ability to recover at the centre of everything we do,\" Oluseyi declared.\n\nFor International Affairs Analyst and Conflict Manager, Aladetan Abiodun, rating humanitarian services can be complex as it varies greatly depending on the region, organisation, and crisis. He added that while many organisations are doing commendable work, the scale and severity of crises often outpace the resources and capacity available.\n\n\"Thus, there's often room for improvement in terms of funding, coordination, and access to affected populations,\" he quipped. He noted that minimizing humanitarian crises requires a multifaceted approach involving both international organisations and world powers. This, he said, includes addressing root causes such as poverty, inequality, and political instability, investing in conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms, ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law, and promoting sustainable development.\n\n\"Additionally, enhancing cooperation and coordination among governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders is essential for effective crisis response and long-term resilience-building efforts,\" he said.\n\nQUOTE\n\nRCRC Day, which is commemorated every May 8, focuses on people who are suffering from various natural calamities, armed conflicts, and other crises;

program featured a range of topics, including climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability, disease control, volunteerism, and disaster management.\n\nVarious team members took turns to engage the pupils, providing valuable insights and practical tips on critical issues about the topics, interspersed with interactive sessions on emergency response and community service.\n\nMadam Maria Johana Yuorpor, the Upper West Regional Chairperson of the GRCS, emphasized the importance of revamping the Red Cross movement, which has seemingly faded from the eyes and minds of people.\n\nShe stressed the need to imbue the spirit of volunteerism in youngsters, encouraging them to become active participants in their communities.\n\n\"We want to inspire the next generation of leaders and volunteers, and empower them to make a positive impact in their communities,\" she said.\n\nMadam Yuorpor said marking World Red Cross Day with the school outreach reaffirmed the Upper West Regional Branch of the GRCS commitment to serving humanity and promoting a safer and more resilient community for all.\n\nMr. Abdul Rauf Issahaku, a member of the GRCS, who delivered a presentation on disaster readiness, preparedness, and mitigation, urged the pupils to contribute in their small ways to avoiding disasters, both natural and artificial, particularly floods and fires.\n\n\"Disaster prevention and preparedness start with individual actions, and we want to equip you with the knowledge and skills to make a difference,\" he emphasized.\n\nHe said disasters disrupts the functioning of society and thus, it was important for community members take little steps towards disaster prevention such as desilting gutters and not building in waterways to prevent floods.\n\nThe event served as a platform to educate and inspire the next generation of leaders and volunteers, fostering a culture of compassion, empathy, and community service in line with the Red Cross/Red Crescent's values of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality.\n\nSome of the pupils who participated in the sensitization expressed happiness about the knowledge that was shared with and pledged to become active volunteers in their community.\n\n\"I learnt about being volunteering to do something willingly without being asked to

The day is celebrated on the birth anniversary of Henry Dunant, who was born on May 8, 1828, in Geneva, Switzerland. He established the International Committee of the Red Cross and received the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901.\n\nHenry Dunant was a Swiss humanitarian, businessman and social activist who established the Red Cross. Born in Geneva on May 8, 1828, Dunant came from a family which was known for its charitable and humanitarian nature. In his youth, Dunant extensively took part in extensive religious activities and also worked full-time for a brief period as a representative of the Young Men's Christian Association.\n\nHe also worked at a Geneva bank and went to Algeria in 1853 to take charge of S\u00e9tif, a Swiss colony. He began to construct a wheat mill but did not get the land concession needed to operate it. He went to Tunisia and then returned to Geneva, where he decided to approach Napoleon III to obtain the business document he needed. But Napoleon at that time was in the field commanding the French forces who, with the Italians, were trying to drive the Austrians out of Italy. An undeterred Dunant showed his bravado and went straight to the headquarters of Napoleon near Solferino in Italy. There, he experienced and participated in the aftermath of one of the bloodiest battles of the 19th century. The struggles of soldiers and lack of infrastructure to treat their wounds on the battlefield pained him, and in 1862, Dunant published a small book 'Un Souvenir de Solf\u00e9rino' (A Memory of Solferino).\n\n'A Memory' tells of the despair on the battlefield and the need to care for the wounded. It proposed that countries should form relief societies to care for the wartime wounded and for that, countries have to appeal for volunteers and train them to help the wounded on the battlefield. The Geneva Society for Public Welfare formed a five-member committee including Dunant on February 7, 1863, to explore the possibility of forming such relief societies. This committee founded the Red Cross. Dunant invested all his money and travelled extensively to governments to send volunteers. On August 22, 1864, 12 nations signed the Geneva Convention when they agreed to assure neutrality to personnel engaged in sanitation, to keep the line of supplies flowing for their use, and to adopt a special emblem to identify them.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swapnajit_kundu@news9live.com", "name": "Swapnajit Kundu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dunant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Dunant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Committee of the Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Solferino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Solferino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Napoleon III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YMCA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austrians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Napoleon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tunisia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_of_Solferino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A Memory of Solferino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Conventions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Disability", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Disability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Henry-Dunant.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 25, "textEnd": 30}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

He suggested that the Red Cross Society, with its principles of humanitarian service, could serve as an example in this regard.\n\nReflecting on Naga society's challenges, Iralu expressed concern over the current state of Naga society, pointing out that both the 'underground' movement and the 'overground' government have, in his view, destroyed themselves and the people for whom they came into being.\n\nStating that nowadays, governance by ministers and MLAs seem to revolve around, \"collecting enough money for the next election\", he questioned whether \"politicians and bureaucrats, although they will be the first to admit that they are not saints, have become helpless victims of voters,\" who have huge expectations for development, but themselves, continue to \"live as selfishly and irresponsibly as we like.\"\n\nIralu opined that unless each person accepts their duty and responsibility to do whatever they do excellently and properly, the society will collapse into a self-created black hole.\n\nHe argued that while it's convenient to blame politicians, it is crucial for each person to recognise that without embracing change and responsibility individually, the very essence of society will deteriorate.\n\n\"Given the enormously increased threats and dangers today due to the immense increase in populations of nations, climate change, depletion of resources, so on, the uncomfortable truth is that blaming, irresponsible use of excuses etc., are now unaffordable luxuries we have to leave behind,\" he added.\n\nFurther, he drew parallels to the Red Cross Society founder, Henry Dunant's observation that dealing only with the \"disease process\" is insufficient.\n\nIn the same way that managing an epidemic is essential and must be executed meticulously, unless the origins of the disease like water, air and soil pollution, unclean drains and garbage dumps, etc., are also dealt with thoroughly, the cycle of epidemics will persist.\n\nThis, he asserted, is a crucial reality that all societies aspiring for progress must grasp and embrace the necessary changes as integral to their standard way of thinking and living.\n\nDuring the programme which was organised by the Indian Red Cross Society Nagaland (IRCSN) State Branch at its conference hall in Kohima, Dr. R Rose Chakhesang, a member of the IRCSN Managing Committee, echoed the event's theme of 'keeping humanity alive.'\n\nShe said that despite how Artificial Intelligence and robots are solving all human problems, humanity will still be alive and continue to keep the core values of life like love, compassion, kindness, and support.\n\nThe event also featured messages from the IRCSN Secretary General, Governor La. Ganesan (President of IRCSN), and Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio (Vice President of IRCSN).

However, young people are often first responders in emergency situations, especially. in communities where younger children are vulnerable or without sufficient adult supervision. Elastoplast, the number one plaster brand in South Africa, has teamed up with the SA Red Cross Red Cross and together they're teaching children 10 to 13 years, upskilling them with solid first aid training.\n\nThe SA Red Cross Society WC's First Aid Schools Project is an existing initiative started in 2022, providing basic first aid training in primary schools and youth-based organizations within the Western Cape, says Nokuthula Khumalo, Brand Manager for Elastoplast. The reason Elastoplast, the number 1 plaster brand, is so committed to the project is they inherently believe everyone should learn essential first aid skills. \"Children are often the first responders,\" explains Khumalo. \"More lives could be saved, health challenges avoided, and trauma contained if those first on the scene were trained in administering wound care and basic first aid,\" she adds. \"This is why SA Red Cross WC First Aid Training within schools is such a fantastic initiative.\"\n\n'Young learners will acquire skills such as CPR, wound care, water hygiene and sanitation - skills needed to act effectively as first responders to their peers', says Marianna Nomdoe, Health and Care Manager from the SA Red Cross Society WC. \"In 2022, the Red Cross teams visited 20 Primary Schools within the Western Cape region, training approximately 2000 primary school learners. Marianna says that \"Now that Elastoplast have so generously contributed towards this initiative of ours it has enabled us to expand and indeed enhance the current program, and the SA Red Cross Society WC is overwhelmed with gratitude. This means our Society enjoys a widened reach, with the team going into 30 schools this year, offering training from Grades Five to Seven. And this affects children in a positive manner with ages ranging from 1 -- 13 years, they are exposed to a comprehensive instruction course. And, with five separate training sessions over five days this makes the training is thorough and comprehensive,\" explains Marianna Nomdoe. To ensure personal attention, each training session teaches 15 children with the course being split int theory, practical exams and then a very valuable certificate.\n\n'And as First Aid is your life line in times of crisis, requiring invaluable life skills whilst building confidence it also impacts on enhancing communication skills and encourages children to work well in a team environment. This means that Frist Aid Training is beneficial in so many ways and embraces the needs of children holistically' says Marianna Nomdoe.", "source": {"uri": "iol.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "IOL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastoplast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elastoplast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Cape", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Cape"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Cape"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communication"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education and Training", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/650x366/?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/889df2d3-13fd-58f4-a63a-02b1bd93bc7e&operation=CROP&offset=5x0&resize=640x360", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544798", "eventUri": "eng-9544798", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Yet, needless to say, I am keenly conscious of the responsibility that goes with the privilege, which I believe is to help developing the understanding and thinking in each one of us to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the Red Cross Society in today's situation of all-round deterioration in our own State, region and globally. And from all that we are seeing, hearing and experiencing of conflict situations going out of control in all continents, we know how important the effectiveness of the Red Cross Society and movement is for our world in peril.\n\nThe official theme of the Red Cross Society globally is \"through humanity to peace\". The theme declared for this unpredictable, increasingly dangerous, year of 2024 is \"Keeping Humanity Alive\".\n\nBoth themes bring in humanity in its entirety, made up of all human beings, as the decisive factor in achieving peace and keeping humanity alive by stopping all that lead to killings.\n\nCornelius Sommaruga, was a Swiss diplomat and President of the International Committee of the Red Cross for 12 years. He became the President of the International Association of Initiatives of Change. I had the privilege of getting to know him and his thinking. He always talked about the urgent need of Globalisation of Responsibility. He said, if globalisation of responsibility is not understood and accepted by everyone today as normal thinking and living, exploitation of economic and political globalisation would inevitably result in massive corruption, violence and unmanageable killings worldwide. He died just about 3 months ago. He was a statesman who understood his times and acted and spoke out correctly.\n\nHere it will be appropriate for me to share what a Swiss friend of mine has written to me. I may add that he, a few years ago, was in Nagaland and took part in a Red Cross rally in Kohima. He wrote:\n\n\"Henry Dunant, the Red Cross Founder, shouted in Italian -TUTTI FRATELLI - which means ALL BROTHERS. He said this again and again at the battle of SOLFERINO, Italy, as he was tending to injured soldiers, giving solace to the dying with the help of the village women of the area! Today his call would be ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS. After days, when the battle was over, he sat exhausted on a box, in despair and horror at the loss of lives. Sunk in silence, suddenly a clear voice within told him, \"RED CROSS\" - the opposite of his nation's flag.\n\nAn organisation of aid in wars, earthquakes and other catastrophes grew out of this thought and found worldwide support.\n\nWhen the Red Cross as an organisation was established and the international Geneva convention came into being, Henry Dunant wanted more - an organisation that would heal the hurts and hates, fears, greed and want of power, regardless of the consequences.\n\nHe was a man of strong faith, and felt an even greater need for this kind of healing. He died feeling his call and work was not completed ... its UP TO US TO COMPLETE IT TODAY.\"\n\nIn our discussion of today's theme - Keeping Humanity Alive, I believe we need to go to the deeper need Henry Dunant saw before he died. He saw the need for the Red Cross Movement to become a movement that would also \"heal the hurts and hates, fears, greed and want of power at all costs\" - not just one that addressed the sufferings of the human body and material destruction.\n\nGiven the enormously increased threats and dangers today due to immense increase in populations of nations, climate change, depletion of resources, so on, the uncomfortable truth is that blaming, irresponsible use of excuses etc., are now unaffordable luxuries we have to leave behind.\n\nWhat Dunant saw was that the international movement he founded dealt only with what is called the \"disease process\".* Dealing with an epidemic of a disease is dealing with the disease process only. In an epidemic emergency controlling and ending the rapid spreading of the disease HAS TO BE DONE and done properly. BUT unless the origins of the disease* are also dealt with thoroughly, like water, air and soil pollution, stagnant drains and garbage dumps, etc., the epidemic will keep breaking out. This you will agree is a most important reality all societies with dreams and aspirations must understand and accept the changes required by everyone as normal thinking and living.\n\nComing to our society today that we have produced together - unless each one of us accepts our duty and responsibility to do whatever we do excellently and properly as we know all Christians, Hindus, Muslims etc., should, whatever our job and place of work may be, our society is collapsing into a Black Hole created by ALL of us. Some of us will self-righteously insist our contribution to the creation of the Hole is not all that much, in fact not harmful at all.But God sees correctly the contribution of each one of us.\n\nCan we deny the following?\n\n* The Naga struggle 'underground' has destroyed itself and the people for whom it got started.\n\n* The Naga Government 'overground' too has destroyed itself and the people for whom it also came into being.\n\n* And what is this destruction UG and OG doing to the Church and other religions in Nagaland?\n\nThe reality for us now is, Lincoln's 'Government of .., by .., and for the people' has been reduced to Government by the Ministers and MLAs for collecting enough money for the next election! (How the bureaucrats manage to get their shares and remain uncensored by the public can only be called modern Naga magic?). We have to say our politicians, although they will be the first to admit they are not saints, yet, have become helpless victims of us, the voters whose attitude is that the politicians must solve the huge problems of development, but we the ordinary guys can live as selfishly and irresponsibly as we like. The share of the ordinary people, all of us, in rendering effective governance impossible is more than we bother to bring into our public discourse. What Globalisation of Responsibility boils down to!\n\nI shall end by making some observations.\n\n* All Nagas will be found to be passionate about doing what is right and good. But we do what is right our way not God's way - and we force Him to bless it. This is where God is left out and the devil takes over, creating his hell on earth right away.\n\n* \"What is wrong is wrong, even if everyone is doing it. And what is right is right, even if no one is doing it.\"** How do we bring this truth back into our thinking and making of choices when faced with right and wrong?\n\n* \"Those who crusade not for God in themselves but against the devil in others, do not succeed in creating a better future but leave it either as it was, or sometimes even perceptibly worse than it was before the crusade began ... It is extremely dangerous to be more against the devil than for God.\" ***\n\nCongress leader Sam Pitroda has stepped down from the post of Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress and his resignation was accepted by the party. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh took to X and announced that Sam Pitroda had decided to resign from the key post \"of his own accord, \" reports The Statesman. Pitroda had been under fire over his controversial remark that Indians in the East resemble the Chinese while those in the South look like Africans.\n\n\"We could hold together a country as diverse as India -- where people on East look like Chinese, people on West look like Arab, people on North look like maybe White and people in South look like Africans. It doesn't matter. We are all brothers and sisters,\" Pitroda said during an interview with The Statesman.\n\n\"We all respect different languages, religions, different looks, customs and food. That's the India I believe in where everybody has a place,\" he said.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the Indian Overseas Congress chairman last month had stirred a controversy over his remarks on \"inheritance tax in US\".\n\n\"In America, there is an inheritance tax. If one has $100 million worth of wealth and when he dies he can only transfer probably 45 per cent to his children, 55 per cent is grabbed by the government. That's an interesting law. It says you in your generation made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair,\" Pitroda was quoted as saying in an interview to a news agency.\n\nPtiroda had said his statement on inheritance tax in the US was \"twisted\" to divert attention from what \"lies\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi is spreading about the Congress manifesto.\n\n(*Dr RD Laing on \"Disease Process and Disease Origins; ** GK Chesterton; *** Aldous Huxley.

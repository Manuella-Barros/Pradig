Matibe said there are good reasons for barbecuing more springboks. Game animals release less methane - a greenhouse gas - than cattle, whose burps are a top source of global warming emissions from agriculture. Foraging in the wild, their meat is, by definition, free-range and lean. A 2023 study by researchers at Stellenbosch University found that zebra meat, in particular, was highly nutritious and very low in fat. Eating more of it could also help conservation efforts, the government argues. South Africa has long adopted a market-oriented approach to conservation, based on the belief that farmers have a better incentive to look after wildlife if they can profit from it. Critics say the model exploits and commoditises animals. But it has proved largely successful. The country's wildlife population has grown from about 500,000 in the 1960s to more than 20 million today. About 80 per cent is in private game reserves that attract tourists and hunters. Some meat could come from the hundreds of herbivores that are culled every year to keep numbers within sustainable levels, the government says. And it wants to convert one million hectares of communal land to game meat production, which could boost black ownership in a sector where, 30 years after the end of apartheid, more than 94 per cent of operators are white males, said Matibe. Requiring little equipment, game has \"really low\" input costs - an advantage for newcomers, added Darren Horner, owner of producer Aloes Meat. MEATY PROBLEMS Yet, in a country mad for barbecue, locally known as braai, little currently ends on the grill. This is partially due to the belief that game is less tender than beef and tastes unusual, according to the strategy, which envisages marketing campaigns to boost consumption. \"Our grandmothers used to stuff it with bacon and leave it in red wine for three days to get rid of that wild taste. To me it only needs a bit of olive oil and salt,\" said Charl de Villiers, head of Game SA, an industry group. There are other hurdles. Authorities plan to draw up quality standards so that all meat can be traced to the source and trusted by supermarkets and restaurants. But these can't be too stringent or risk scaring away informal producers, said Horner. Meanwhile, exports of cloven-hoofed animals to Europe have been banned for years as South Africa struggles to contain outbreaks of the foot and mouth disease that farmers blame on inadequate border controls. State laboratories to test meat are small and outdated, which further limits export potential, producers say. De Villiers currently has to ship his ostrich meat to Britain for testing, which increases costs. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT Stephen Nel, owner of the Camo Meat abattoir in Bela Bela, said he applied for an export licence in 2017 but has since given up on it. \"It was a very big disappointment for me. The government failed us,\" Nel said, wearing khaki shorts and a matching shirt inside his refrigerated facility.", "summary": "Game animals release less methane - a greenhouse gas - than cattle, whose burps are a top source of global warming emissions from agriculture.", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/zebra-game-meat-south-africa-4429951", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s---IN-kWmR--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/3d9bcf66cf118286851d05314070c7503592b165.jpg?itok=", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:59:13", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": -0.003}

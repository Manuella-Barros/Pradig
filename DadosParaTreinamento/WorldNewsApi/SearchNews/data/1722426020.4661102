{"id": 243263042, "title": "Barack Obama's Debate Post Raises Eyebrows: 'Not Really Helpful'", "text": "Several commentators were critical of former President Barack Obama's reaction to the first 2024 presidential debate, where his former running mate's performance raised alarm bells in Democrats ahead of November.In a post to X, formerly Twitter, Friday afternoon, Obama offered support for President Joe Biden's reelection run, whose demeanor Thursday night renewed concerns over the 81-year-old's age and ability to serve another four years. A Biden aide told Newsweek that the president was suffering from a cold.\"Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,\" read Obama's statement.\"Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight \u2014 and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit,\" the former president continued. \"Last night didn't change that, and it's why so much is at stake in November.\"Thursday's debate was the first time that Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, faced former President Donald Trump this election cycle. The night began with Biden speaking with a rather raspy-sounding voice and was filled with several gaffes.Trump, meanwhile, repeated many of the same falsehoods that he has used throughout his campaign, including regarding Democrats' policies on abortion, the economy and immigration. The former president is 78 years old and is the first former president in U.S. history to be criminally convicted.Biden's performance has sparked concern from some close to the Democratic Party, and commentators have suggested that the president should be replaced with a different candidate before November. Obama's comments of support were received by several as being untimely coming off such a poor debate performance, including political commentator Chris Cillizza, who addressed Obama's point about having a \"bad\" debate night.\"Just to be clear: What Obama had in 2012 in the first debate against [Utah Senator Mitt] Romney was a 'bad debate night.' He was rusty and it showed,\" Cillizza wrote, referring to the former president's debate appearance in October 2012 where he stumbled through many answers.\"That IN NO WAY compared to what we saw from Biden last night,\" Cillizza added. \"Biden was not rusty. He was out of it. It was a historically bad performance.\"Tim Miller, a political commentator and former communications director for 2016 GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush, responded to Obama's post, \"This would be a good tweet in 41 days. Not really helpful today.\"Freelance writer Louis Peitzman wrote, \"It is completely f***ing insane that this is the party's position.\"Bill Kristol, chief of staff to former Vice President Dan Quayle and conservative political commentator, raised questions about the former president's statement, calling it \"A curious tweet.\"\"1. You don't ask President Obama for this unless you're seeing a meltdown among Democratic elites,\" Kirstol wrote. \"2. There's nothing in it particular to Biden. Obama's criteria for the anti-Trump side of the choice he describes also fit Harris, Whitmer, Shapiro, and others.\"Newsweek sent a note to Obama's office via email for further comment.Michael Tyler, the communications director for Biden's campaign, told reporters on Friday that there were \"no conversations...whatsoever\" regarding plans for the president to step aside this election.\"The Democratic voters nominated Joe Biden,\" Tyler added. \"Joe Biden is the nominee.\"", "summary": "The former president offered words of support for Biden despite the president's rough debate performance on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/barack-obama-debate-post-raises-eyebrows-1919060", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2419587/obamas-debate-post-raises-eyebrows.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:26:52", "author": "Kaitlin Lewis", "authors": ["Kaitlin Lewis"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.441}

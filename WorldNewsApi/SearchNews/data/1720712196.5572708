{"id": 231952370, "title": "America hailed as 'land of opportunity' as water-skiing squirrel wows onlookers", "text": "Shoppers at a mall in the US were left in awe after coming across a water-skiing squirrel, which has since been praised as emblematic of the \"land of opportunity\". The daredevil rodent was spotted skimming across a pool on miniature skis, being towed by a small remote-controlled boat. An enthralled observer shared the spectacle on X/Twitter, saying: \"I'm at the mall and there is a squirrel waterskiing. America truly is the land of opportunity.\" The hilarious video quickly went viral, amassing more than 2.3million views and over 83,000 likes. In the video, an off-screen commentator can be heard supplying additional details about our aquatic squirrel - and the animal is quite extraordinary indeed. \"Twiggy was in Anchorman, Dodgeball, Down to Earth, she's been in over 11 movies,\" the voice is heard stating. The online community was also impressed with Twiggy's stardom and skill. One viewer commented: \"I tried to think of something funny to say, but this is just the coolest thing I've ever seen.\" Another declared it was \"the best thing I've seen today\", while one long-time fan reminisced about witnessing a similar scene in the past. \"I saw this 20+ years at the NYC boat show in the Javits center,\" they wrote. \"They got a new squirrel. The 90s were peak American empire.\" A number of squirrels have been Twiggy down the years. Twiggy, who officially retired in 2018 following farewell performances, seems now to be back in the water and performing the famous water=skiing act. Not without a fair share of controversy, the squirrel performer is presently forbidden in Toronto due to animal rights concerns. The water-skiing creature rose to fame thanks to its appearance on Anchorman as a news item, with Will Ferrell's character Ron Burgundy observing with astonishment: \"How about that. That squirrel can water-ski.\"", "summary": "A squirrel was spotted water-skiing at a shopping centre in the US and onlookers were left speechless - with one declaring it was 'the coolest thing they'd ever seen'", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/america-hailed-land-opportunity-water-32992159", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32992207.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_image.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:49:38", "author": "Ewan Gleadow,Ewan-Gleadow", "authors": ["Ewan Gleadow", "Ewan-Gleadow"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.596}

At first, I thought it was a small callus, but as months went by, it was getting larger. I started to google and realized I had a plantar wart on my thumb! So I got the Freeze Off and thought, 'This has to work!' Nope! I tried the Freeze Off three times, and nothing! I then realized the same thing was happening on my other thumb, a small callus but I knew that the wart had spread! Now I was desperate to get rid of them and knew I had waited too long! I bought the invisible strips, and they removed my small wart in four days and my big wart in eight!! I couldn\u2019t believe it. I left strips on for two days, then pulled back the dead skin with a cuticle clipper and reapplied! My bigger wart was a little tougher to remove, and I had irritated my skin trying to cut it out, so I left it alone for a few days before reapplying a strip, and by the second 48-hour treatment, it was gone! I thought my skin would be damaged, but it looks like nothing was ever there!\" \u2014Audrey N.

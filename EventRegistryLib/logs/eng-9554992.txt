A landmark settlement led to the development of regional service areas in north, central and south county in which local cities agreed to build shelters designed to guide transients toward permanent housing. The county also developed more outreach to the homeless and provided more mental health services.\n\n\"Our continuum of care created that capacity that allows our county to absorb all of the adverse forces in society that pushed the number of homeless up and to maintain it as a pretty stable level over five years,\" Do said. \"Seven percent is very low ... and we see other counties not coming anywhere close to what we've achieved and I'm very proud of that fact.\"\n\nSupervisor Katrina Foley, who led similar reform efforts when she was mayor of Costa Mesa, said that while lobbying in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, she intended to push HUD and the county congressional delegation for more affordable housing grants to help move people in transitional centers into permanent housing so those still on the streets will have a bed.\n\n\"The five-year lookback is an appropriate measure given that in between the five years we've had a pandemic and lot of factors that wouldn't be realistic data in that cycle,\" Foley said. \"The important information for my office and what I'll be drilling down on is we have a bottleneck in our system.\n\n\"We need to work with more urgency to build more projects,\" she added. \"We still have 1,811 units to build out our system that we identified in 2022. I suspect those numbers will double, but regardless we don't have enough permanent housing to keep the flow going. Seventy percent of the people in our shelters are ready to go into permanent housing and there isn't a unit for them to move into.\"\n\nKim said it will be key for the county to work collaboratively not only with its cities, but also with neighboring counties.\n\n\"We succeed and fail together,\" he said. \"The homeless individuals we know can move from city to city and county to county, so it's important we work together even outside of Orange County. That regional approach is very important. And I think that in the past we've not had as strong a collaboration ... That's something we'll have to look at.\"\n\nKim said the counts have become more accurate because the county has been using the same method for five years and with a database there's less risk of double counting or missing people. Also, the database has shown officials where the homeless are most likely to congregate.\n\nOfficials say part of the reason for the increase in homelessness could be rising inflation, which has prompted federal officials to hike interest rates. That increases rents and mortgages, experts say.\n\nOfficials are hoping that if inflation can meet the 2% target sometime this year, interest rates will be cut and that will lower housing costs. Inflation increased after the federal government stimulated the economy as it struggled to get through the pandemic.\n\nAnother factor could be an eclipse in the $300 million in rental assistance funding given out by the county and state to prevent residents from eviction during the pandemic. The moratorium on evictions ended on May 31, 2022.\n\nSince 2019, 61 emergency shelters were established in Orange County to serve about 3,000 people, an increase of 730 beds. Since 2018, 1,364 affordable and supporting housing units have been built.\n\nFrom 2022 to this year, the county added 681 shelter beds for a total of 3,920. The county built 859 units since January 2022.\n\nFoley said in her meetings with developers she's identified \"three key areas preventing the expediting of affordable housing.\" Interest rates on construction loans is one issue, but the costs for constructional materials such as lumber and steel are \"particularly, extraordinarily expensive,\" Foley said.\n\nThe county must also focus on reducing bureaucratic costs related to building, she said.\n\n\"We have to figure out a way to reduce the time and expedite the permit process,\" she said.\n\nHelping developers procure construction materials through partnerships with government that can get discounts from high-volume orders might help, she said.\n\n\"I'm working on a procurement policy where maybe we can piggyback on federal procurement contracts or county or state contracts,\" she said.\n\nThe county has made great strides getting homeless families off the streets, but more work needs to be done helping veterans, Foley added.\n\nOf the 7,322 homeless individuals counted, 3,227 are in the northern part of the county, 3,454 are in the central part of the county and 641 were in south county.\n\nVeterans accounted for 328 people in the count, and 308 were ages 18 to 24.

Welcome to the asylum!\n\nDespite spending more and more and money on homeless services, the problem in California gets worse and worse.\n\nWhile the ranks of homeless swelled more slowly in Orange County than elsewhere, there are still 28% more unhoused folks here today than there were in 2022 -- despite county government spending more than twice as much money to help these folks (about $112.3 million in 2022, and $263.3 million in 2024), according to the latest Point In Time survey and county financial data.\n\nAn admittedly obnoxious back-of-the-napkin calculation suggests that we could have given every homeless person about $35,000 -- which would pay for a one-bedroom apartment with pool and gym in many lovely neighborhoods in the O.C. -- and saved a few million to boot.\n\nIf you look over a gentler five-year time frame -- back to 2019, before COVID-related eviction moratoriums and emergency cash aid helped people keep roofs over their heads -- homelessness was up only 7% in O.C., while it was up 20% statewide and (gulp) 29% in neighboring counties.\n\nMore than 180,000 Californians were homeless last year -- a 53% increase from 2013, a recent report from the state auditor said.\n\nA third of America's unhoused people are here, in the Golden State.\n\nForgive us for shouting, but WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, CALIFORNIA. Civilized societies don't allow vulnerable people to live -- and die -- on public streets.\n\nLet's acknowledge the nexus between homelessness and addiction. In 2019, 33.7% of unsheltered adults acknowledged having substance use issues. This year, fully half -- 50% -- said the same. If we were the betting type, we'd wager that was an undercount.\n\nPolicymakers might swallow their insistence on abstinence, recognize that some folks don't want to stop using drugs, and get them into safe consumption sites where they at least have access to help if and when they're ready, and access to medical help to keep them alive in the meantime. (More than 500 homeless people died on the Orange County streets last year -- the vast majority from overdoses.)\n\nThey also might build more housing! Yes, California has an official \"housing first\" philosophy to guide homelessness spending. It's eminently logical: \"Housing First is an approach ... that recognizes a homeless person must first be able to access a decent, safe place to live, that does not limit length of stay (permanent housing), before stabilizing, improving health, reducing harmful behaviors, or increasing income,\" the state policy geeks say.\n\nSpot on! Excellent! Except that ... there's still not enough. Despite California investing $24 billion over the last five years to battle homelessness. The state and counties push for more, but land use is largely in control of cities.\n\n\"We don't have enough permanent housing,\" said Doug Becht, director of the county's Office of Care Coordination, briefing reporters on the Point In Time data on Wednesday. \"The amount of people entering homelessness is outpacing our system's ability to get them into permanent housing. ... It's really an issue of housing capacity at this point.\"\n\nOne day in April, Orange County officials surveyed hundreds of people staying in two shelters. Nearly three-quarters of those folks -- 72% -- had completed all the necessary steps to be eligible for permanent housing. But only 1 in 12 -- 8% -- could be placed, Becht said.\n\nMore Homekey and CalWORKS Housing Support might help.\n\nWhile the state audit blasted California for failing to track its homeless spending well enough to divine if programs were actually working, it found these two were \"likely\" cost-effective. Homekey helps local governments turn run-down motels into housing (costing an average of $144,000 per unit, compared to new construction costs of $380,000 to $570,000), while the CalWORKS Housing Support Program provides financial aid to families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless (costing some $12,000 to $22,000 per household, while a chronically homeless person can cost up to $50,000 a year).\n\nThere's reason to be at least a little hopeful. Orange County has distributed hundreds of housing shelter vouchers and added hundreds of beds over the last several years. It has hundreds more coming online. California's new CARE Court system, which seeks to get severely mentally ill people off the streets and into treatment, might help as well.\n\nBecht stressed that the Point In Time count is strictly a census of homelessness on one given day -- not an assessment on the homeless services system -- but it can be hard to see it that way.\n\nThe measure of an effective homeless services system should be a decrease in homelessness, no?", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "teri_sforza@ocregister.com", "name": "Teri Sforza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_First", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Housing First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moratorium_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moratorium (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Need_to_Do_Something", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "We Need to Do Something"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abstinence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Land use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voucher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voucher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OCR-L-PITRESULTS-0509-01.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554992", "eventUri": "eng-9554992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

In Anaheim, 816 people, or about 57% of that population, is sheltered.\n\nAs for reasons for the increase, the county cited about $300 million in rental assistance that was awarded by the county and state during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as California's Eviction Moratorium that was in place until the end of May in 2022.\n\nThe county said it's still working to add more shelter beds, as the current capacity is just shy of 4,000.", "source": {"uri": "ktla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTLA 5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_turner@ktla.com", "name": "Austin Turner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Ana, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Ana, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Construction_and_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Construction and Planning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 25}], "image": "https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/02/5dv32h6t4bgchnmta36kkrc5cy.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554992", "eventUri": "eng-9554992", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

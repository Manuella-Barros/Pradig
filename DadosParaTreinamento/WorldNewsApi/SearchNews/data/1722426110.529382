And with the 25th overall pick in the 2024 NHL Draft, the Bruins swung for the fences with a high-upside prospect down the middle. Boston selected center Dean Letourneau (St. Andrew\u2019s College) with their re-acquired first-round pick, bringing in a 6-foot-7 forward who boasts both a high ceiling \u2014 but also a fair share of questions regarding his floor at hockey\u2019s highest level. Here\u2019s five things to know about Boston\u2019s first-round selection: Letourneau\u2019s size makes him a difference-maker Letourneau is far from the only first-round talent in his draft class who has earned high marks for his playmaking capabilities and skating skills. But few NHL prospects boast that skillset in a 6-foot-7, 214-pound frame. Even though there have been plenty of viable NHL prospects who have projected as bruising power forwards, Letourneau is cut from a different cloth in that he doesn\u2019t necessarily play like a 6-foot-7 skater. Rather than rely on just his size to impose his will in the offensive zone, Letourneau\u2019s agility and poise with the puck are regularly mentioned in his scouting reports \u2014 with his intimidating frame used more as a complement to his overall skill set, rather than the primary avenue for his success. \u201cHe moves really well for a big guy,\u201d St. Andrew\u2019s coach David Manning told NHL.com\u2019s Adam Kimelman. \u201cHis skating and his agility and his explosiveness are all very different for a bigger guy like him. \u2026 I think he\u2019s going to shock a lot of people with his athleticism. \u201cHe\u2019s not your typical big, lanky guy. His athleticism is probably a little bit unknown. You watch him, you see it in his skating ability, he\u2019s got good agility, he turns well, there\u2019s no awkwardness to how he moves. He is long but there\u2019s no awkwardness to him. He\u2019s very athletic.\u201d While he\u2019s viewed as a bit of a project given his unorthodox path toward becoming a first-round talent, Letourneau\u2019s blend of size and skill makes him a gamble that could pay off if his game translates to higher levels of competition. \u201cHe\u2019s very intriguing to me, has a ton of potential and could have a really high ceiling,\u201d NHL Central Scouting\u2019s Nick Smith told Kimelman of Letourneau. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to find a player with his size and length to have soft hands and good feet. He can make plays with sense and vision with a scoring touch around the net. He still has a ton of filling out to do as well.\u201d He lit up the prep circuit While most hockey prospects in North America raise their stock through the collegiate ranks, the USHL, and the CHL, Letourneau opted for a different path. Despite getting drafted by the Owen Sound Attack of the OHL in the ninth round (No. 174) of the 2022 OHL draft, Letourneau chose the prep-school route with St. Andrew\u2019s College. Letourneau promptly torched the competition against fellow prep opponents, especially during the 2023-24 season. The 18-year-old pivot scored a whopping 61 goals and 127 points in just 56 games for St. Andrew\u2019s, including a league-leading 25 points in 14 games within the Prep Hockey Conference. While the level of competition at the prep circuit is a drop from other leagues, Letourneau\u2019s video-game stat line is eye-popping, especially when factoring in his unique profile as a big-bodied, agile forward. \u201cI got to play 20-plus minutes a night: power play, PK. I started every game, I finished every game,\u201d Letourneau said of what he got out of his time at St. Andrew\u2019s College. \u201cA lot of people, they don\u2019t like the league that I played in \u2014 because it was a little lower in competition. \u201cBut I mean, we played U-20 in Prague and Germany. We played U-20 teams in Canada. We played all the prep schools in the state. So that\u2019s Shattuck-St. Mary\u2019s, Mount Saint Charles. So our competition wasn\u2019t as low as everyone kind of says it is.\u201d He\u2019s been compared to an All-Star forward Considering his unique makeup as a 6-foot-7 playmaking forward, it should come as little surprise what current NHLer Letourneau has drawn comparisons to \u2014 at least if he hits his ceiling. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a player and he\u2019s really creating a lot of buzz. I call him like a Tage Thompson 2.0,\u201d Leland De Langley, a skills coach at St. Andrew\u2019s College, told Scott Wheeler of The Athletic. \u201cHis skating, his shot, and the way he can control a puck in tight for a guy that\u2019s 6-foot-7 or 6-foot-8, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d Thompson \u2014 a 6-foot-6 forward who relies on far more than just his imposing frame to dominate in the offensive zone \u2014 has developed into one of the more unique and effective forwards in the league over the last few seasons. Over his last three seasons with the Sabres, Thompson has averaged 38 goals and 72 points. The Bruins would be thrilled if Letourneau followed a similar trajectory as Thompson within their organization. It should be important to note that even though Thompson is one of the more impactful players in the NHL, he also took some time to develop and find his footing at the pro game. Before taking off in his first full season in Buffalo in 2021-22, Thompson scored just 18 goals over his first 145 games in the NHL ranks. Patience will also need to be preached for an intriguing, but raw, prospect like Letourneau. His competition in prep league raises concerns about his NHL upside Even though Letourneau preached the benefits of playing at St. Andrew\u2019s College, the primary knock regarding his potential as an impact NHLer revolves around the level of competition he feasted on in 2023-24 \u2014 and whether or not his impressive production will continue to translate to high levels. As Corey Pronman of The Athletic noted, Letourneau\u2019s potential as a top-six center \u2013 coupled with his size \u2014 makes him a player worth rolling the dice on. But it remains to be seen if he\u2019s the next Tage Thompson, or maybe more of a middle-six player whose sterling scoring numbers are due for some regression moving forward. \u201cLetourneau isn\u2019t a high-energy compete and some scouts question his effort at times, but he gets to the middle well enough and isn\u2019t afraid of using his body,\u201d Pronman wrote. \u201cThe debate on Letourneau will be how real his offense is. The athleticism is obvious, but is he actually NHL smart or does he have NHL scoring ability? \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to pinpoint at the low level of competition he faced all season. He could be Tage Thompson, but he could be Joe Colborne or Riley Tufte.\u201d He\u2019s playing in the Bruins\u2019 backyard this fall Don Sweeney and the rest of the Bruins\u2019 front office won\u2019t have to travel very far to watch Letourneau develop. Letourneau is set to play for Boston College in the fall, with the Ontario native making the jump up to the college ranks in 2024-25 after former Eagles star Will Smith signed his entry-level contract with the Sharks in May. \u201cI mean, their track record of developing elite NHL talent is pretty huge,\u201d Letourneau said of his decision to commit to the Eagles. \u201cThey\u2019ve just got guys last year that were picked fourth, eighth, and I think 23rd in the first round. So they get a lot of guys that develop to be great NHL players. So that was kind of the biggest decision for me.\u201d Letourneau, who initially committed to Northeastern in 2022, plans to develop at Chestnut Hill for at least a few seasons before hopefully making the jump to the NHL \u201cI\u2019m gonna try to make Boston as soon as possible\u2014 that\u2019s my goal is to make the NHL as soon as possible,\u201d Letourneau said. \u201cSo I\u2019m gonna work my best this offseason and next year at Boston College and kind of see where it takes me. But I would probably say one or two years until I think I\u2019d be ready to step into Boston.\u201d", "summary": "<p>\"He\u2019s a hell of a player and he\u2019s really creating a lot of buzz.

And we didn't get told much about it because we know that we need to focus on the tournament. So our heads are 100 percent there.\"\n\nWilson-Hardy has yet to comment on the investigation.\n\nAfter Team GB lost to the U.S. on Monday, it ended their chance of winning a medal in Paris. Following their win, the U.S. women's rugby sevens team reached the semifinals where they will play defending Olympic champions New Zealand on Tuesday, July 30. Even if they don't win against New Zealand, Team USA could still have a chance to medal in the bronze matchup against the loser of Canada vs. Australia.\n\n\"It is really important to have a profile, and a profile for our sport,\" social media star and Olympic rugby player, Ilona Maher, shared with The Guardian on Monday, referencing why this year's games are more important than just winning a medal. \"It's about building the brand. We are female rugby players -- we're not getting million-dollar contracts, we're not getting paid the money that we should be.\"\n\nMaher, 27, explained how her and her friends are \"keen\" on making women's rugby a more well-known sport.\n\n\"It's important in the U.S. where so much attention is on other sports,\" she told the outlet. \"And I think it's just about showing the personality that the women have. The game is very strong, not just for men, but for women too.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "caitlyn_somers@usmagazine.com", "name": "Caitlyn Somers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Wilson-Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amy Wilson-Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Uren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emma Uren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abi_Burton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abi Burton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilona_Maher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ilona Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Olympic-Rugby-Player-Under-Racism-Investigation-Pulled-from-Competition-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773957", "eventUri": "eng-9773957", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 161, "textEnd": 168}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1406, "textEnd": 1413, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The dialogue, which includes a photograph of a rugby player wearing a dark-colored mask, came to light on social media.\n\nAn anonymous individual made a derogatory remark within the conversation, referring to the rugby player as \"Real chocolate face.\" Subsequently, Wilson-Hardy responded, stating, \"I thought I would be better off with black people.\"\n\nAn image of the conversation was shared on Instagram by an anonymous account, prompting an official response from the British Olympic Association. Amy Wilson-Hardy, aged 32, is a member of Team GB's rugby sevens squad for the Paris Olympics and was also part of the team at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn the ongoing Paris Olympics, Team GB's women's rugby sevens squad progressed to the quarter-finals after securing two wins and one loss in the group stage. Their victories came against Ireland and South Africa, with a loss to Australia in between.\n\nWilson-Hardy competed in all three matches, including the team's 26-17 win against South Africa, securing second place in their group.\n\nIt is worth noting that Team GB's women's rugby sevens team previously achieved fourth place in both the Rio Olympics and the 2020 Olympics, a tournament from which Wilson-Hardy was not selected. The men's team also secured fourth place in Tokyo following their silver medal win in Rio.\n\nNotably, Great Britain's men's team will not participate in the 2024 Paris Olympics after failing to qualify in the final Olympic qualifier in June.\n\nIn the most recent Paris Olympics matches, Team GB's women's team encountered the USA in the semi-finals, where they suffered a 17-7 defeat.

Last week, Olympic equestrian gold medalist Charlotte Dujardin withdrew from the Paris Olympics after a years-old video emerged allegedly showing her mistreating a horse.\n\n\"I am sincerely sorry for my actions and devastated that I have let everyone down,\" Dujardin wrote on social media.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Wilson-Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amy Wilson-Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abi_Burton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abi Burton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Uren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emma Uren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Dujardin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Dujardin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/30/609f391e-8251-4a48-bf2c-dd580ac07584/thumbnail/1200x630/04ecbe88f64f9c38f0308c2f631a1609/gettyimages-2163714896.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773957", "eventUri": "eng-9773957", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

I've been considered overweight my whole life. In middle school, in high school, I was always considered overweight. I remember vividly one time in high school, I (turned in a) physical to the office, and right at the bottom of the page, it said overweight.

Team GB stated that Wilson-Hardy had been withdrawn on medical grounds and replaced by Abi Burton.\n\nCaptain Emma Uren reported that the players were largely unaware of the allegations and were focusing on the tournament. The team has implemented a phone ban to minimise distractions. Coach Ciaran Beattie declined to comment on the situation, emphasising their concentration on the rugby matches.\n\nThis controversy adds to the difficulties faced by the GB rugby sevens programme. The men's team failed to qualify for the Olympics, losing to South Africa in their final qualification match. The women's team, despite entering the competition with medal aspirations, was eliminated in the quarterfinals after a 17-7 loss to the United States.\n\nThe defeat against China means Britain will now compete for seventh place against Ireland. The match against China was notable for a crucial error by Isla Norman-Bell, who inadvertently gave the Chinese team a penalty opportunity by throwing the ball into touch.

The reply to this comment reads: \"Thought I'd have a better chance with the blacks,\" purportedly posted by Wilson-Hardy.\n\nAn anonymised account shared a screengrab of the conversation on Instagram. A spokesperson for the British Olympic Association told Mirror Sport: \"The British Olympic Association has been made aware of an image published on a social media platform and is investigating the matter.\"\n\nWilson-Hardy, 32, is a member of Team GB's rugby sevens squad for the Paris Olympic Games. She was also part of the team for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, reports the Mirror.\n\nTeam GB advanced to the quarter-finals of the women's tournament in Paris after securing two victories and one loss in their group. They triumphed over Ireland and South Africa, but were defeated by Australia between those two matches.\n\nWilson-Hardy participated in all three of these games. Monday's match against South Africa resulted in a 26-17 win for Team GB, ensuring they secured second place in their group.\n\nTeam GB secured fourth place in the women's rugby sevens at the Rio Olympics, and repeated this feat in 2020, a tournament which saw Wilson-Hardy not making the squad.\n\nThe men's team also came in fourth in Tokyo, after bagging a silver medal in Rio. However, there will be no British men's team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, due to a loss to South Africa in the final Olympic qualifier in June.\n\nIn their quarter-final match in Paris on Monday night, Team GB's women faced off against the United States. Despite all four quarter-finals happening on the same evening, they suffered a 17-7 defeat against the American team.\n\nThe semi-finals are set for Tuesday, with the final and the bronze medal match scheduled for later the same day.\n\nTributes have continued to pour in for former Llanelli, Wales and Lions player Peter Morgan, who has died at the age of 65.\n\nMorgan was capped five times for Wales and was called up by the Lions for their 1980 tour of South Africa.\n\nThe Scarlets wrote yesterday: \"Scarlets are deeply saddened to learn that our former player Peter Morgan has passed away. Peter played 275 matches for the Scarlets, scoring 90 tries and captained the club to victory over Australia in 1984.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with Peter's family and friends at this sad time.\"\n\nAfter his retirement from rugby, Morgan entered local politics, sitting as an independent member on Pembrokeshire County Council for 16 years.\n\nYesterday they released a statement, with the leader of the authority paying his own tribute.\n\n\"Pembrokeshire County Council was extremely saddened to learn of the death of county councillor Peter Morgan at the weekend,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Cllr Morgan had represented The Havens ward for 16 years and served as the chairman of Pembrokeshire County Council in 2012.\n\n\"One of Pembrokeshire's most talented rugby players, Cllr Morgan represented Llanelli, Wales and the British & Irish Lions during a distinguished career.\n\n\"Cllr Jon Harvey, the leader of Pembrokeshire County Council, said: 'On behalf of everyone at the council, I send our sincere condolences to Peter's family and friends.\n\n\"'Peter was such a character, always with a smile on his face but also fierce determination to do his best and fight for his constituents and the people of Pembrokeshire.\n\n\"'Peter's warmth, energy and sense of humour will be sadly missed in the council chamber and beyond'.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A spokesperson for the British Olympic Association told Mirror Sport: \"The British Olympic Association has been made aware of an image published on a social media platform and is investigating the matter.\"\n\nWilson-Hardy, 32, is a member of Team GB's rugby sevens squad for the Paris Olympic Games. She was also part of the team for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, reports the Mirror.\n\nTeam GB advanced to the quarter-finals of the women's tournament in Paris after securing two victories and one loss in their group. They triumphed over Ireland and South Africa, but were defeated by Australia between those two matches.\n\nWilson-Hardy participated in all three of these games. Monday's match against South Africa resulted in a 26-17 win for Team GB, ensuring they secured second place in their group.\n\nTeam GB secured fourth place in the women's rugby sevens at the Rio Olympics, and repeated this feat in 2020, a tournament which saw Wilson-Hardy not making the squad.\n\nThe men's team also came in fourth in Tokyo, after bagging a silver medal in Rio. However, there will be no British men's team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, due to a loss to South Africa in the final Olympic qualifier in June.\n\nIn their quarter-final match in Paris on Monday night, Team GB's women faced off against the United States. Despite all four quarter-finals happening on the same evening, they suffered a 17-7 defeat against the American team.\n\nThe semi-finals are set for Tuesday, with the final and the bronze medal match scheduled for later the same day.\n\nTributes to Morgan\n\nTributes have continued to pour in for former Llanelli, Wales and Lions player Peter Morgan, who has died at the age of 65.\n\nMorgan was capped five times for Wales and was called up by the Lions for their 1980 tour of South Africa.\n\nThe Scarlets wrote yesterday: \"Scarlets are deeply saddened to learn that our former player Peter Morgan has passed away. Peter played 275 matches for the Scarlets, scoring 90 tries and captained the club to victory over Australia in 1984.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with Peter's family and friends at this sad time.\"\n\nAfter his retirement from rugby, Morgan entered local politics, sitting as an independent member on Pembrokeshire County Council for 16 years.\n\nYesterday they released a statement, with the leader of the authority paying his own tribute.\n\n\"Pembrokeshire County Council was extremely saddened to learn of the death of county councillor Peter Morgan at the weekend,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Cllr Morgan had represented The Havens ward for 16 years and served as the chairman of Pembrokeshire County Council in 2012.\n\n\"One of Pembrokeshire's most talented rugby players, Cllr Morgan represented Llanelli, Wales and the British & Irish Lions during a distinguished career.\n\n\"Cllr Jon Harvey, the leader of Pembrokeshire County Council, said: 'On behalf of everyone at the council, I send our sincere condolences to Peter's family and friends.\n\n\"'Peter was such a character, always with a smile on his face but also fierce determination to do his best and fight for his constituents and the people of Pembrokeshire.\n\n\"'Peter's warmth, energy and sense of humour will be sadly missed in the council chamber and beyond'.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

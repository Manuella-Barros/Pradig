"body": "After a disappointing 3-0 loss to Spain in their opener, Croatia were behind again when Qazim Laci gave Albania an early lead in Hamburg.\n\nAlbania left Croatia in danger of a group-stage exit from Euro 2024 after a thrilling 2-2 draw on Wednesday as Albania's Klaus Gjasula scored at both ends, including a dramatic injury-time equaliser.\n\nAfter a disappointing 3-0 loss to Spain in their opener, Croatia were behind again when Qazim Laci gave Albania an early lead in Hamburg.\n\nBut Croatia improved after making two half-time substitutions and Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, before Gjasula put through his own net.\n\nThe Albania midfielder became the last-gasp hero, though, slotting into the bottom corner in the fifth minute of injury time to snatch his team a point.\n\nCroatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament.\n\nAlbania have won plenty of plaudits with their performances against both Italy, in a 2-1 defeat, and Croatia, but could not hold a lead in either game and will probably have to beat Spain to keep their last-16 hopes alive.\n\nCroatia's 'golden generation' were ultimately made to pay for a poor first-half display and are in danger of bowing out from major tournament football in limp fashion.\n\nCroatia coach Zlatko Dalic opted against a change in formation from the Spain defeat, sticking with his midfield trio of Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic.\n\nBut he brought in Ivan Perisic at left-back, moving Manchester City's Josko Gvardiol into central defence.\n\nAlbania start fast again\n\nThe smell of smoke from flares filled the air outside the stadium as the supporters of both teams created one of the best atmospheres of the tournament so far.\n\nAlbania scored the fastest goal in European Championship history after just 23 seconds against Italy and they made another quick start.\n\nIt took until only the 11th minute for Sylvinho's men to break the deadlock this time, as Sparta Prague midfielder Laci ghosted into the area unmarked to nod home an inch-perfect, inswinging cross from Jasir Asani.\n\nCroatia tried to impose their passing game, but Albania were constantly in their faces and continued to look the more dangerous side, with right-back Elseid Hysaj firing off target.\n\nThe underdogs could have doubled their advantage just after the half-hour mark, but Kristjan Asllani was denied by Dominik Livakovic when face-to-face with the Croatia goalkeeper.\n\nAlbania striker Rey Manaj passed up another excellent opportunity, failing to get enough purchase on his free header in first-half added time to seriously trouble Livakovic.\n\nDalic responded by making two changes at the interval, bringing on 21-year-old Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic for the ineffective Lovro Majer and Brozovic.\n\nThose substitutions brought about a quick improvement from Croatia, as Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha made a good save to keep out Sucic's left-footed shot, before Pasalic headed over seconds later.\n\nAlbania continued to threaten on the counter-attack, though, with Nedim Bajrami drilling wide of the near post in the 67th minute.\n\nBut Croatia finally found a way through in the 74th minute as substitute Ante Budimir picked out Kramaric inside the box and the forward cut inside before sending a composed finish inside Strakosha's near post.\n\nThe turnaround appeared to be complete two minutes later as Sucic's close-range effort was blocked, but only against the unfortunate Gjasula and into an empty net.\n\nAlbania did not give up, missing a series of chances as it appeared Croatia would cling on.\n\nGjasula had other ideas though, sweeping a loose ball home before a chaotic denouement that saw both sides throw bodies forward in search of a winner, to no avail.", "source": {"uri":

tournament football in limp fashion.\n\nCroatia coach Zlatko Dalic opted against a change in formation from the Spain defeat, sticking with his midfield trio of Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic.\n\nBut he brought in Ivan Perisic at left-back, moving Manchester City's Josko Gvardiol into central defence.\n\nALBANIA START FAST AGAIN\n\nThe smell of smoke from flares filled the air

seconds against Italy and they made another quick start.\n\nIt took until only the 11th minute for Sylvinho's men to break the deadlock this time, as Sparta Prague midfielder Laci ghosted into the area unmarked to nod home an inch-perfect, inswinging cross from Jasir Asani.\n\nCroatia tried to impose their passing game, but Albania were constantly in their faces and continued to look the more dangerous side, with right-back Elseid Hysaj firing off target.\n\nThe underdogs could have doubled their advantage just after the half-hour mark, but Kristjan Asllani was denied by Dominik Livakovic when face-to-face with the Croatia goalkeeper.\n\nAlbania striker Rey Manaj passed up another excellent opportunity, failing to get enough purchase on his free header in first-half added time to seriously trouble Livakovic.\n\nDalic responded by making two changes at the interval, bringing on 21-year-old Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic for the ineffective Lovro Majer and Brozovic.\n\nThose substitutions brought about a quick improvement from Croatia, as Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha made a good save to keep out Sucic's left-footed shot, before Pasalic headed over seconds later.\n\nAlbania continued to threaten on the counter-attack, though, with Nedim Bajrami drilling wide of the near post in the 67th minute.\n\nBut Croatia finally found a way through in the 74th minute as substitute Ante Budimir picked out Kramaric inside the box and the forward cut inside before sending a composed finish inside Strakosha's near post.\n\nThe turnaround appeared to be complete two minutes later as Sucic's close-range effort was blocked, but only against the unfortunate Gjasula and into an empty net.\n\nAlbania did not give up, missing a series of chances as it appeared

A very beautiful, historic day for me.\"\n\nIn the first-ever competitive match between the two Balkan teams, Croatia tried to set the pace from the start, but it was Albania's Qazim Laci who scored first, heading in a cross from the right flank in the 11th minute.\n\nAndrej Kramaric equalized in the 74th minute before Gjasula's own goal made it 2-1 for Croatia just two minutes later.\n\nAt that point, Croatia looked in control but a late surge by Albania changed everything once again as Gjasula redeemed himself by scoring with a low shot in the 95th minute.\n\nIt was a thrilling end-to-match that leaves both Croatia and Albania in a precarious situation in the group. Albania lost to defending champion Italy 2-1 in its first match.\n\nThe third-place Albanians, who are ahead of Croatia on goal difference, celebrated the most after the match, while Luka Modric and his teammates -- semifinalists at the 2022 World Cup -- looked disappointed as they applauded the Croatian fans.\n\n\"We would have been a lot happier if we hadn't conceded the last goal. The situation would have been totally different,\" Kramaric said. \"We turned the match, and we should have won. But that's football.\"\n\nThe Volksparkstadion in Hamburg was split evenly between red-clad Albania fans and spectators in Croatia's checkered shirt providing a loud and energetic atmosphere.\n\nFans in Croatia's section set off flares repeatedly, despite warnings over the loudspeakers that it would result in disciplinary action.\n\nCroatia struggled to create chances in the first half and could have faced a greater deficit but goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic blocked a shot from Kristjan Asllani and a header from Rey Manaj to keep it 1-0 at halftime.\n\nThe Croatians came out with more energy after the break and turned the match around in two minutes. Kramaric equalized with a shot just inside the post. And just moments later Gjasula was unlucky when Albania tried to clear the ball from the penalty area but it bounced off him and into the net for the fourth own goal of the tournament.\n\nAlbania coach Sylvinho said he was proud of his team's performance. Albania is playing only its second European Championship and was considered unlikely to advance out of the group.\n\n\"It was amazing. I will remember this game all my life,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Llazar Semini in Tirana, Albania, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Asllani", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristjan Asllani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_Manaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rey Manaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksparkstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volksparkstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sylvinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tirana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tirana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/preview-1630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

It was Laci who took responsibility, sprinting 25 yards to get in behind Perisic and glance an inswinging delivery past goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic.\n\nThe pattern of the game remained set, with Albania remaining deep and breaking in their droves, yet it took until the 21st minute for Croatia to threaten a goal as Marcelo Brozovic sent the ball wide of the far post from distance.\n\nBruno Petkovic should have also done better with a header from eight yards out, and it almost cost Croatia as Albania squandered a golden opportunity at the other end, Kristjan Asllani somehow failing to beat Livakovic having gotten in behind the defence.\n\nIn the final moments of the half, Manaj was also guilty of failing to double Albania's lead, sending a header straight at Livakovic from in front of goal.\n\nDalic reacts to poor opening 45 minutes\n\nZlatko Dalic wasted no time in tinkering with his Croatia side, making two changes as Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic were introduced in place of Brozovic and Lovro Majer.\n\nWithin five minutes of the restart, Sucic should have scored having found space inside the area, only for goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha to remain big and parry his effort away from danger.\n\nThat was the catalyst for a sustained spell of pressure from Croatia as Albania dropped deeper and deeper, their attackers - possibly jaded from their first-half efforts - feeding on mere scraps.\n\nTo their credit, Albania responded in brief flurries, giving their backline a well-earned breather, yet as the game entered the final quarter, Pasalic sent another header over the crossbar at the far post.\n\nCroatia's equaliser finally came with 16 minutes remaining. Kramaric had been ineffective for much of the contest, but the 33-year-old - on his birthday - showed the composure required in the big moment when needed, wrong-footing an Albania defender before slotting the ball inside the near corner from 10 yards.\n\nAlbania's hearts broke when Croatia went ahead shortly afterwards. After Kramaric combined with Ante Budimir, the latter pulled the ball back where an Albania defender struck the ball against the helpless Gjasula and into the net.\n\nThat goal knocked the stuffing out of Albania and it felt that a fourth goal of the contest was far more likely to come from Croatia as the game approached a conclusion.\n\nHowever, Sylvinho's side made a mockery of that perception. Gvardiol had bravely prevented Mirlind Daku from volleying home from close range, but it only set up Gjasula for his famous moment, the Darmstadt 98 midfielder - who had been introduced as a substitute - sweeping home from 12 yards to send Albania fans into delirium as they collected just their fourth point at a European Championship.\n\nMan of the Match\n\nBoth sides had contenders for the man of the match accolade, yet we cannot give it to anyone else but Gjasula, who was only on the pitch for 18 minutes plus seven minutes of added-on time.\n\nThe 34-year-old had never scored for his country and has just one club goal to his name since the start of 2020-21. Realistically, the veteran has just become the answer to a quiz question that will stand the test of time.\n\nWhen do Croatia, Albania play again at Euro 2024?\n\nThe remaining fixtures for Croatia and Albania will each take place on Monday at 8pm, BST, with Croatia facing Italy and Albania squaring off against Spain.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType":

The Turkish Messi who lit up Euro 2024 with wonder strike\n\nThe smell of smoke from flares filled the air outside the stadium as the supporters of both teams created one of the best atmospheres of the tournament so far.\n\nAlbania scored the fastest goal in European Championship history after just 23 seconds against Italy and they made another quick start.\n\nIt took until only the 11th minute for Sylvinho's men to break the deadlock this time, as Sparta Prague midfielder Laci ghosted into the area unmarked to nod home an inch-perfect, inswinging cross from Jasir Asani.\n\nCroatia tried to impose their passing game, but Albania were constantly in their faces and continued to look the more dangerous side, with right-back Elseid Hysaj firing off target.\n\nThe underdogs could have doubled their advantage just after the half-hour mark, but Kristjan Asllani was denied by Dominik Livakovic when face-to-face with the Croatia goalkeeper.\n\nAlbania striker Rey Manaj passed up another excellent opportunity, failing to get enough purchase on his free header in first-half added time to seriously trouble Livakovic.\n\nDalic responded by making two changes at the interval, bringing on 21-year-old Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic for the ineffective Lovro Majer and Brozovic.\n\nThose substitutions brought about a quick improvement from Croatia, as Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha made a good save to keep out Sucic's left-footed shot, before Pasalic headed over seconds later.\n\nAlbania continued to threaten on the counter-attack, though, with Nedim Bajrami drilling wide of the near post in the 67th minute.\n\nBut Croatia finally found a way through in the 74th minute as substitute Ante Budimir picked out Kramaric inside the box and the forward cut inside before sending a composed finish inside Strakosha's near post.\n\nThe turnaround appeared to be complete two minutes later as Sucic's close-range effort was blocked, but only against the unfortunate Gjasula and into an empty net.\n\nAlbania did not give up, missing a series of chances as it appeared Croatia would cling on.\n\nGjasula had other ideas though, sweeping a loose ball home before a chaotic denouement

After a disappointing 3-0 loss to Spain in their opener, Croatia were behind again when Qazim Laci gave Albania an early lead in Hamburg. But Croatia improved after making two half-time substitutions and Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, before Gjasula put through his own net.\n\nThe Albania midfielder became the last-gasp hero, though, slotting into the bottom corner in the fifth minute of injury time to snatch his team a point.\n\nCroatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament. \"We will believe until the very end, to give our best as we did in this match,\" said forward Kramaric.\n\n\"Unfortunately we didn't win but we hope to be a bit luckier against Italy.\"\n\nAlbania have won plenty of plaudits with their performances against both Italy, in a 2-1 defeat, and Croatia, but could not hold a lead in either game and will probably have to beat Spain to keep their last-16 hopes alive. \"We have to go forward but we have to fight for every single point,\" said Albania coach Sylvinho.\n\n\"It's important for our lives, the life of the country, the federation. I'm proud of the players so we have to enjoy the moment.\"\n\nCroatia's 'golden generation' were ultimately made to pay for a poor first-half display and are on the brink of bowing out from major tournament football in limp fashion.\n\nThe smell of smoke from flares filled the air outside the stadium as the supporters of both teams created one of the best atmospheres of the tournament so far.\n\nAlbania scored the fastest goal in European Championship history after just 23 seconds against Italy and they made another quick start.\n\nIt took until only the 11th minute for Sylvinho's men to break the deadlock this time, as Sparta Prague midfielder Laci ghosted into the area unmarked to nod home an inch-perfect, inswinging cross from Jasir Asani.\n\nCroatia tried to impose their passing game, but Albania were constantly in their faces and continued to look the more dangerous side, with right-back Elseid Hysaj firing off target.\n\nThe underdogs could have doubled their advantage just after the half-hour mark, but Kristjan Asllani was denied by Dominik Livakovic when face-to-face with the Croatia goalkeeper.\n\nAlbania striker Rey Manaj passed up another excellent opportunity, failing to get enough purchase on his free header in first-half added time to seriously trouble Livakovic.\n\nDalic responded by making two changes at the interval, bringing on 21-year-old Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic for the ineffective Lovro Majer and Brozovic.\n\nThose substitutions brought about a quick improvement from Croatia, as Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha made a good save to keep out Sucic's left-footed shot, before Pasalic headed over seconds later.\n\nCroatia finally found a way through in the 74th minute as substitute Ante Budimir picked out Kramaric inside the box and he cut inside before sending a composed finish inside Strakosha's near post.\n\nThe turnaround appeared to be complete two minutes later as Sucic's close-range effort was blocked, but rebounded off the unfortunate Gjasula and into an empty net.\n\nAlbania did not give up, missing a series of late chances as it appeared Croatia would cling on.\n\nGjasula had other ideas though, sweeping a loose ball home before a chaotic denouement that saw both sides throw bodies forward in search of a winner, to no avail.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news",

I'm proud of the players so we have to enjoy the moment.\"\n\nCroatia's 'golden generation' were ultimately made to pay for a poor first-half display and are on the brink of bowing out from major tournament football in limp fashion.\n\nCroatia coach Zlatko Dalic opted against a change in formation from the Spain defeat, sticking with his midfield trio of Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic.\n\nBut he brought in Ivan Perisic at left-back, moving Manchester City's Josko Gvardiol into central defence.\n\nAlbania start fast again\n\nThe smell of smoke from flares filled the air outside the stadium as the supporters of both teams created one of the best atmospheres of the tournament so far.\n\nAlbania scored the fastest goal in European Championship history after just 23 seconds against Italy and they made another quick start.\n\nIt took until only the 11th minute for Sylvinho's men to break the deadlock this time, as Sparta Prague midfielder Laci ghosted into the area unmarked to nod home an inch-perfect, inswinging cross from Jasir Asani.\n\nCroatia tried to impose their passing game, but Albania were constantly in their faces and continued to look the more dangerous side, with right-back Elseid Hysaj firing off target.\n\nThe underdogs could have doubled their advantage just after the half-hour mark, but Kristjan Asllani was denied by Dominik Livakovic when face-to-face with the Croatia goalkeeper.\n\nAlbania striker Rey Manaj passed up another excellent opportunity, failing to get enough purchase on his free header in first-half added time to seriously trouble Livakovic.\n\nDalic responded by making two changes at the interval, bringing on 21-year-old Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic for the ineffective Lovro Majer and Brozovic.\n\nThose substitutions brought about a quick improvement from Croatia, as Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha made a good save to keep out Sucic's left-footed shot, before Pasalic headed over seconds later.\n\nCroatia finally found a way through in the 74th minute as substitute Ante Budimir picked out Kramaric inside the box and he cut inside before sending a composed finish inside Strakosha's near post.\n\nThe turnaround appeared to be complete two minutes later as Sucic's close-range effort was blocked, but rebounded off the unfortunate Gjasula and into an empty net.\n\nAlbania did not give up, missing a series of late chances as it appeared Croatia would cling on.\n\nGjasula had other ideas though, sweeping a loose ball home before a chaotic denouement that saw both sides throw bodies forward in search of a winner, to no avail.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type":

Albania lost to defending champion Italy 2-1 in its first match.\n\nThe third-place Albanians, who are ahead of Croatia on goal difference, celebrated the most after the match, while Luka Modric and his teammates -- semifinalists at the 2022 World Cup -- looked disappointed as they applauded the Croatian fans.\n\n\"We would have been a lot happier if we hadn't conceded the last goal. The situation would have been totally different,\" Kramaric said. \"We turned the match, and we should have won. But that's football.\"\n\nThe Volksparkstadion in Hamburg was split evenly between red-clad Albania fans and spectators in Croatia's checkered shirt providing a loud and energetic atmosphere.\n\nFans in Croatia's section set off flares repeatedly, despite warnings over the loudspeakers that it would result in disciplinary action.\n\nCroatia struggled to create chances in the first half and could have faced a greater deficit but goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic blocked a shot from Kristjan Asllani and a header from Rey Manaj to keep it 1-0 at halftime.\n\nThe Croatians came out with more energy after the break and turned the match around in two minutes. Kramaric equalized with a shot just inside the post. And just moments later Gjasula was unlucky when Albania tried to clear the ball from the penalty area but it bounced off him and into the net for the fourth own goal of the tournament.\n\nAlbania coach Sylvinho said he was proud of his team's performance. Albania is playing only its second European Championship and was considered unlikely to advance out of the group.\n\n\"It was amazing. I will remember this game all my life,\" he said.

If we will play like today everything can happen,\" he told reporters.\n\nCroatia will meet Italy in Leipzig at the same time with the odds against them.\n\n\"The first half was very bad but the second much better, which is encouraging for the match with Italy,\" added Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic. \"We are still in the game, we shall prepare and do all in our power to go on.\"", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksparkstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volksparkstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasir_Asani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasir Asani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Asllani", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristjan Asllani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_Manaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rey Manaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Strakosha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Strakosha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/espn/misc_logos/500/soccer.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

with dramatic draw", "body": "After a disappointing 3-0 loss to Spain in their opener, Croatia were behind again when Qazim Laci gave Albania an early lead in Hamburg.\n\nBut Croatia improved after making two half-time substitutions and Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, before Gjasula put through his own net.\n\nThe Albania midfielder became the last-gasp hero, though, slotting into the bottom corner in the fifth minute of injury time to snatch his team a point.\n\nCroatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament.\n\nAlbania have won plenty of plaudits with their performances against both Italy, in a 2-1 defeat, and Croatia, but could not hold a lead in either game and will probably have to beat Spain to keep their last-16 hopes alive.\n\nCroatia's 'golden generation' were ultimately made to pay for a poor first-half display and are in danger of bowing out from major tournament football in limp fashion.\n\nCroatia coach Zlatko Dalic opted against a change in formation from the Spain defeat, sticking with his midfield trio of Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic.\n\nBut he brought in Ivan Perisic at left-back, moving Manchester City's Josko Gvardiol into central defence.\n\nAlbania start fast again\n\nThe smell of smoke from flares filled the air outside the stadium as the supporters of both teams created one of the best atmospheres of the tournament so far.\n\nAlbania scored the fastest goal in European Championship history after just 23 seconds against Italy and they made another quick start.\n\nIt took until only the 11th minute for Sylvinho's men to break the deadlock this time, as Sparta Prague midfielder Laci ghosted into the area unmarked to nod home an inch-perfect, inswinging cross from Jasir Asani.\n\nCroatia tried to impose their passing game, but Albania were constantly in their faces and continued to look the more dangerous side, with right-back Elseid Hysaj firing off target.\n\nThe underdogs could have doubled their advantage just after the half-hour mark, but Kristjan Asllani was denied by Dominik Livakovic when face-to-face with the Croatia goalkeeper.\n\nAlbania striker Rey Manaj passed up another excellent opportunity, failing to get enough purchase on his free header in first-half added time to seriously trouble Livakovic.\n\nDalic responded by making two changes at the interval, bringing on 21-year-old Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic for the ineffective Lovro Majer and Brozovic.\n\nThose substitutions brought about a quick improvement from Croatia, as Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha made a good save to keep out Sucic's left-footed shot, before Pasalic headed over seconds later.\n\nAlbania continued to threaten on the counter-attack, though, with Nedim Bajrami drilling wide of the near post in the 67th minute.\n\nBut Croatia finally found a way through in the 74th minute as substitute Ante Budimir picked out Kramaric inside the box and the forward cut inside before sending a composed finish inside Strakosha's near post.\n\nThe turnaround appeared to be complete two minutes later as Sucic's close-range effort was blocked, but only against the unfortunate Gjasula and into an empty net.\n\nAlbania did not give up, missing a series of chances as it appeared Croatia would cling on.\n\nGjasula had other ideas though, sweeping a loose ball home before a chaotic denouement that saw both sides throw bodies forward in search of a winner, to no avail.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type":

A very beautiful, historic day for me.\" In the first-ever competitive match between the two Balkan teams, Croatia tried to set the pace from the start, but it was Albania's Qazim Laci who scored first, heading in a cross from the right flank in the 11th minute.\n\nAndrej Kramaric equalized in the 74th minute before Gjasula's own goal made it 2-1 for Croatia just two minutes later.At that point, Croatia looked in control but a late surge by Albania changed everything once again as Gjasula redeemed himself by scoring with a low shot in the 95th minute.It was a thrilling end-to-match that leaves both Croatia and Albania in a precarious situation in the group. Albania lost to defending champion Italy 2-1 in its first match.\n\nThe third-place Albanians, who are ahead of Croatia on goal difference, celebrated the most after the match, while Luka Modric and his teammates - semifinalists at the 2022 World Cup - looked disappointed as they applauded the Croatian fans.\n\n\"We would have been a lot happier if we hadn't conceded the last goal. The situation would have been totally different,\" Kramaric said. \"We turned the match, and we should have won. But that's football.\"\n\nThe Volksparkstadion in Hamburg was split evenly between red-clad Albania fans and spectators in Croatia's checkered shirt providing a loud and energetic atmosphere.Fans in Croatia's section set off flares repeatedly, despite warnings over the loudspeakers that it would result in disciplinary action.\n\nCroatia struggled to create chances in the first half and could have faced a greater deficit but goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic blocked a shot from Kristjan Asllani and a header from Rey Manaj to keep it 1-0 at halftime.\n\nThe Croatians came out with more energy after the break and turned the match around.

after making two half-time substitutions and Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, before Gjasula put through his own net.\n\nThe Albania midfielder became the last-gasp hero, though,

first-half display and are in danger of bowing out from major tournament football in limp fashion.\n\nCroatia coach Zlatko Dalic opted against a change in formation from the Spain defeat, sticking

In the last seconds, sometimes you score a goal to win, sometimes you concede,\" said Kramaric.\n\nAlbania finish their group schedule against Spain in Duesseldorf on Monday and Gjasula said they held out hope.\n\n\"We know that the game with Spain is very difficult but in football everything is possible. If we will play like today everything can happen,\" he said.\n\nCroatia will meet Italy in Leipzig at the same time with the odds against them.\n\n\"The first half was very bad but the second much better, which is encouraging for the match with Italy,\" added Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic. \"We are still in the game, we shall prepare and do all in our power to go on.\"\n\nThey've done so much for their country, the likes of Ivan Perisic, Marcelo Brozovic and Luka Modric, but sitting at the foot of Group B with a point to their name, it is looking increasingly likely they will be signing off their international careers in disappointment. They face Italy on Monday.\n\nWhat a thrilling game in Hamburg. Croatia will be kicking themselves especially after doing so well to turn things around in the second half. Albania looked tired late on but they held on and got their equaliser. The story of the day was Gjasula who came on as a substitute in a stadium he used to play in regularly with Hamburg, scored a devastating O.G. then went up the other end and salvaged a point for his country in dramatic fashion. Brilliant.\n\nAm I watching the NBA play-offs or the Euros? It's like a game of basketball now, end to end stuff. Albania have one last stab then Croatia do the same, Kovacic's shot saved and the final whistle goes. I really didn't want that game to end. This is what the Euros is all about.\n\nGjasula with a late late equaliser and redemption! It looked for a while there like Albania were dead and buried but they've pulled it out of the hat. What a game! Gvardiol is on the turf, head in hands, as are the thousands of Croatian fans in the stadium.\n\nDaku has two goes in a chaotic box scramble. He finally blasts it over.\n\nAlbania with a big chance to equalise. Hoxha's effort is parried into the path of sub Mirlind Daku but his follow-up from close range is blasted over. Flag goes up for a offside though.\n\nModric goes for one from range but it goes just wide. Would have been the cherry on top. Baturina takes on his man on the left edge of the box, he hits a shot while falling but the keeper saves.\n\nCroatia subs: Kramaric and Perisic make way for Sosa and Baturina.\n\nAll Croatia now. Albania wilting rapidly. Perisic's crossing today has been nothing short of sublime. He floats in another beauty that nearly gets to Budamir. Speaking of Budamir, he's been fantastic since coming on, making all the difference. They needed a big second half Croatia, and they have delivered.\n\nThey've turned it around! And what a calamitous goal it is. Gjasula own goal. Budamir beats his man on the end line and plays it to Pasalic with an open goal. The shot is blocked but the clearance deflects off the substitute and flies into his own net. Have to feel for the Albanians.\n\nKramaric finally finds the net! Albania's resistance broken. Kovacic flicks it to Budamir who plays in Kramaric. The former Leicester man slots home and they're level.\n\nGoalscorer Laci makes way for 34-year-old Gjasula. Juranovic loses it near his own area, its stolen by Bajrami but his effort is weak.\n\nPerisic with another cross from wide left, met by Petkovic but no luck. Budimir on for Petkovic for Croatia.\n\nBajrami takes on Gvardiol, waits for him to commit but the Manchester City defender doesn't so he tries his luck. The ball goes high, right and wide. At least the Albanians are starting to find their way back into the game now.\n\nLaci is fuming. The Albanians steal possession in the Croatian half, Laci is free in space with the potential of a one-on-one but they play the ball backwards. Dumbfounded.\n\nCroatia continue to pile on the pressure here. Albania struggling to get out of their own half, being forced backward on every attempt to break. When they do finally get out Aslani has a go from the edge of the area but it is underhit and Livakovic gathers happily.\n\nSeferi comes on for Asani for the Albanians.\n\nModric hits a piledriver right into the midriff of Amadani. The referee stops play. Andros Townsend makes his discontentment known on ITV commentary.\n\n\"I wouldn't be stopping the game for that\"\n\n\"Does a football to the stomach count as a serious injury?\"\n\nAlbania yet to threaten in this half so far but they've already shown they don't need many chances to score. Croatia very much in control at the moment though. Another cross, another header, no goal but a corner for Croatia. Modric whips it in and somehow Sutelo missed from centimeters with a free header. Modric can't believe his eyes.\n\nKovacic tries one from just outside the area. It is deflected but it doesn't phase Strakosha who stays central and catches with ease. Perisic with yet another cross into the box but no one there to head it home.\n\nThe ball finds its way to Sucic in the box, great opportunity but it is hit straight at the keeper. Perisic flies one into the danger area. It's met by Pasalic who heads wide. Croatia getting a foothold now.\n\nPerisic with another long throw into the area. Petkovic rises to meet again but it goes wide for a goal kick.\n\nSucic involved already. He crosses to Petkovic who can't connect properly with his head to guide it goalwards.\n\nSucic and Pasalic come on for Majer and Brozovic. Fresh legs clearly needed by Croatia especially in the midfield. 45 minutes left for Croatia to save their tournament - and reputation.\n\nAlbania will be more than happy with that first-half display. They've got their goal, created plenty of chances, looked dangerous whenever they've entered the Croatian half and managed to keep their oppositions attacking force at bay. More of the same in the second half one would assume.\n\nManaj has a great chance in front of goal. Cross whipped in by Hysaj onto the forehead of Manaj who heads it into the ground. Livakovic saves well again. Seconds later Croatia attack. Perisic's cross is met by Petkovic and saved wonderfully by Strakosha. The referee blows up anyway for offside. Half-time.\n\nKramaric sends in another one, this time to Majer. It looks like the Albanian defender gets a touch on it but the linesman gives a goal kick.\n\nKovacic loses possession leading to a quick Albania counter. It is quelled but they hold possession. The Albanian crowd are drowning out the Croatian chants. Kramaric beats his man a couple of times on the edge of the box before crossing it into nobody in the box.\n\nModric sends the free in but Strakosha punches away. Long ball is played over the top to Asani from a quick free but he fails to control it. Brozovic has a go down the other end but it trickles into the keepers gloves.\n\nCroatia have yet to test Albanian keeper Strakosha. They play around with the ball in the middle of the park. They certainly have players who can hurt an opposition, when will they get their first big chance of the game? They have a free on the edge of the area now. Could this be it?\n\nWhat a chance for Albania! Ball played through to Asllani who is one-on-one with Livakovic but the keeper stays tall and saves the midfielder's effort. Could so easily have been two.\n\nFree for Albania. It's a bit long but Bajrami manages to find Laci whose cross is cleared. Asani finds Manaj in the box who heads it down to Hysaj. The defender hits it first time on the half-volley but it flies over. Albania still looking the more dangerous in attack.\n\nMajer floats in another lethal cross off his left, right onto the head of Petkovic but the striker can't guide it goalwards and it goes over the crossbar.\n\nModric pulling the strings in midfield as expected. Croatia put some nice link-up play together. They're starting to look a bit more productive in possession (they currently have 63 percent of it). Twice they get close to the box but the Albanians break down their attack.\n\nEnd to end again. Bajrami in a foot race with Sutelo but the Croatian clears. Kramaric finds himself in a similar situation down the other end but the defenders do their job. Juranovic has a go from the edge of the area but it drags just wide.\n\nPerisic launches a long throw into the box, dangerous but cleared. Perisic whips in another cross seconds later but the Albanians deal.\n\nAlbania appeal for a penalty but the referee is having none of it. Down the other end Modric steals the ball from a napping Mitaj but Arlind Ajeti kicks it out, stopping a potential Croatia attack.\n\nCroatia looking so open and vulnerable at the moment. Bajrami cuts in from the left and unleashes one but the keeper palms it into the side netting. Hysaj attempts the spectacular from the outside of the box but it is blocked.\n\nIt's been a pretty fast start to the game from both sides. Hysaj curls in a cross that Sutelo fails to properly clear. The ball is played back out to the midfield. It's whipped in once more from the right hand side and met by Laci in the box who heads it past Livakovic. Another early goal for the Albanians!\n\nCroatia with their first period of pressure. Maher cross cleared from corner. Ivanovic tries to find Petkovic with another cross from wide but cleared once more. Hysaj loses the ball to Kovacic on the edge of the area but they quickly win it back.\n\nAlbania again looking sharp in the Croatian half. They win a free 35 yards out, the ball is clipped in to Asani by Manaj but Sutalo heads it back to the keeper.\n\nAlbania stringing some nice passes together in the opening phase of play, looking confident. Ball played over the top to Bajrami who crosses low but it is cleared by Gvardiol.\n\nAnd we're off...\n\nBoth teams belt out their national anthems with pride as the sun beats down in Hamburg. Kick-off in three minutes.\n\nAlbania coach Sylvinho spoke during the week, touching on his approach to games against bigger teams.\n\n\"I have seen other sides in this tournament. If you try and go toe-to-toe with them, they will score five or six against you,\" said the former Arsenal and Barcelona defender.\n\n\"It's only our second time here in the Euros. We have young players, very good players, but it's not easy.\"\n\nThe Albanian team has been announced prior to kick-off and there's is neither sight nor sound of Chelsea striker Armando Broja in the starting 11, perhaps their most recognisable player.\n\nCroatia's Euro hopes have been dealt a blow with midfielder Nikola Vlasic ruled out of the tournament through injury.\n\nThe 26-year-old Torino midfielder, formerly of West Ham and Everton, picked up a muscle injury in training. Vlasic has been capped 56 times for his country.\n\nFollowing a scan, Vlasic said he will now be heading home.\n\n\"I'm extremely sorry that this new injury will prevent me from helping the team,\" Vlasic said.\n\n\"I've done everything possible to be ready, and I'd like to thank the head coach and the coaching staff for the opportunity. I believe in this team and I'm sure they will succeed - I'll be their biggest fan!\".\n\nCroatia have lost three of their past five competitive matches, going down against Turkey, Wales and Spain in this run. It is is as many defeats as they had suffered across their previous 29 games in competitive action combined. They'll need to turn that form around if they are to escape the Euro 2024 group stages.\n\nGood afternoon everybody and welcome to the Telegraph's live blog of the Group B clash between Croatia and Albania at the Volksparkstadion in Hamburg. We will be taking you through every moment, every bulge of the net, every woodwork hit and every crunching tackle made as Croatia aim to bounce back from their disappointing 3-0 defeat to Spain in the tournament's opening round of matches.\n\nAs for the Albanians, they nearly caused a mighty upset in their opening encounter with Italy, scoring after just 23 seconds, but the current European champions turned it around in true Azzurri fashion, eventually winning 2-1 thanks to goals from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella.\n\nDespite their underwhelming display against Spain, the Croatian squad are well used to playing on the biggest stage and will no doubt be favourites for this. Zlatko Dalic's side reached the 2018 World Cup final and the penultimate stages in Qatar in 2022.\n\nThey have recovered from slow starts before, progressing from the group stage at Euro 2020 despite losing to England in their opening game, and as previously mentioned at the last World Cup they reached the semi-finals after an opening loss to Morocco.\n\n\"There is no room for pessimism, everything is still in our hands,\" Dalic said. \"Of course, we have to be better. It's my job to turn the team around\" he continued.\n\nTheir goal difference surely isn't doing them any favours in the group but a big win in Hamburg today can make up for it, especially with Italy taking on Spain tomorrow night.\n\nEuro 2024 has brought us plenty of goals thus far, let's hope that continues today.

competitive match between the two Balkan teams on Wednesday, Croatia tried to set the pace from the start, but it was Albania's Qazim Laci who scored first, heading in a cross from the right flank in the 11th minute.\n\nAndrej Kramaric equalised about half an hour into the second half and an own goal by Klaus Gjasula made it 2-1 for Croatia just two minutes later.\n\nGjasula then redeemed himself by scoring Albania's equaliser in injury time.\n\nThe result leaves both sides in a precarious situation in group B after Croatia lost to Spain and Albania to Italy in their first matches.\n\nThe Albanians, who are ahead of Croatia on goal difference in the group standings, celebrated most after the match, while Luka Modric and his teammates looked disappointed as they applauded the Croatian fans.\n\nThe Volksparkstadion in Hamburg was split evenly between red-clad Albania fans and spectators in Croatia's checkered shirt providing a loud and energetic atmosphere throughout the match.\n\nFans in Croatia's section set off flares repeatedly, despite warnings over the loudspeakers that it would result in disciplinary action.\n\nCroatia struggled to create chances in the first half and could have faced a greater deficit but goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic blocked a shot from Kristjan Asllani and a header from Rey Manaj to keep it 1-0 at halftime.\n\nThe Croatians came out with more energy in the second half and turned the match around in two minutes.\n\nKramaric equalised with a shot just inside the post and, just moments later, Gjasula was unlucky when Albania tried to clear the ball from the penalty area but it bounced off him and into the net for the fourth own goal of the tournament.\n\nAt that point, Croatia seemed to be in control but Gjasula's strike five minutes into injury time made it 2-2 to the delight of the Albanian fans.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Both teams were looking to bounce back after opening game defeats in Group B -- Croatia to a strong Spain side and Albania thrilling early against Italy but struggling to maintain momentum.\n\nA defeat here would almost certainly end either team's hopes of progressing to the round of 16.

Klaus Gjasula scored in the 90+5th minute to secure a 2-2 draw against a lacklustre Croatian side. Croatia had 22 shots with 10 on target, while Albania had 15 shots with 7 shots on target. Croatia dominated the possession, keeping 68 per cent of the ball compared to Albania's 32 per cent possession.\n\nAlbania took the lead in the 11th minute after Jasir Asani crossed the ball to Qazim Laci, who expertly headed it home to send the travelling fans into delirium. The midfielder from Sparta Prague took the opportunity, running behind Croatia's defence line and beautifully headed the ball into the goal.\n\nIn the first half, Croatia held up possession of the game but were not clinical in the final third. In the second half though, Croatia picked up the pace and started driving the ball towards the goal, playing direct football instead of side passing. Albania were struggling to defend against the persistent Croatian attacks and inevitably conceded when Kramaric finished off a Croatian build-up, slotting past Thomas Strakosha and scoring Croatia's first goal in the Euro 2024 campaign in the 74th minute.\n\nKramaric's goal fuelled the Croatian players, who were struggling to impose themselves in the first half. After the 74th-minute equaliser, Croatia began playing aggressive direct football and forced an error out of Albanian midfielder Gjasula, who unintentionally put the ball into his own net. Croatia came back from a goal down in the first half to score 2 goals in 2 minutes in the second half.\n\nCroatia dominated the possession in the second half and were continuously threatening Albania's goal. The Albanian defence held off the dangerous Croatian attacks in the second half. It seemed like all hope was lost as the match entered the injury time of an additional 5 minutes.\n\nBut the spirited Albanian side never lost hope and pressed hard for the equaliser in the dying stages. They were eventually rewarded in the last minute of the match, securing an unbelievable late comeback to draw against Croatia. Klaus Gjasula, the man who scored an own goal to give Croatia the lead in the 76th minute, redeemed himself with an emphatic finish to end the match in a stalemate.\n\nWhat's Next For Croatia and Albania?\n\nThe 2-2 draw result might have just crushed Croatia's hopes of qualifying for the UEFA Euro 2024 Round Of 16 stage. With a draw and a loss each and a -3 goal difference, Croatia are placed fourth with 1 point in their group. They now face the daunting task of overcoming the Italian challenge in the final game of Group B on 25th Jun, Tuesday at 12:30 AM IST.\n\nAlbania, on the other hand, might have a chance to come second if they beat Spain in their last match of Group B. The European minnows sit in third position with 1 point in their group as they also have 1 draw and 1 loss but only a -1 goal difference. Albania will face Spain on 25th June, Tuesday at 12:30 AM.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aman_joe@news9live.com", "name": "Aman Joe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasir_Asani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasir Asani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksparkstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volksparkstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Sparta_Prague", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AC Sparta Prague"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Strakosha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Strakosha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Croatia-vs-Albania.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 2701, "textEnd": 2709, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

In the last seconds, sometimes you score a goal to win, sometimes you concede,\" said Kramaric.\n\nAlbania finish their group schedule against Spain in Duesseldorf on Monday and Gjasula said they held out hope.\n\n\"We know that the game with Spain is very difficult but in football everything is possible. If we will play like today everything can happen,\" he told reporters.\n\nCroatia will meet Italy in Leipzig at the same time with the odds against them.\n\n\"The first half was very bad but the second much better, which is encouraging for the match with Italy,\" added Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic. \"We are still in the game, we shall prepare and do all in our power to go on.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksparkstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volksparkstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Asllani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristjan Asllani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasir_Asani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasir Asani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_Manaj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rey Manaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Strakosha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Strakosha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Budimir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ante Budimir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elseid_Hysaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elseid Hysaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berat_Djimsiti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berat Djimsiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--txKhBBXW--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-06-19t150512z_1_lynxmpek5i0gu_rtroptp_3_soccer-euro-cro-alb-report.jpg?itok=OTYCZaOu", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Both teams lost their opening matches and can't afford another defeat if they want to keep hope alive of advancing from the group stage. The match starts at 3 p.m. local time (9 a.m. EST) in Hamburg. Here's what to know:\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- The two Balkan teams have never met in a competitive match before. Albania is playing in only its second European Championship after qualifying for the tournament in 2016.\n\n-- Luka Modric's Croatia is looking to rebound from a confidence-bruising 3-0 loss to Spain in the group opener.

UEFA says that included a \"provocative message\" allegedly displayed by fans, the throwing of objects, use of fireworks and a field invasion by a fan near the end of the game.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- Croatia midfielder Nikola Vlasic didn't take part in the team's training session on Monday but is expected to be fit for Wednesday's match. Vlasic came on as a second-half substitute against Spain.\n\n-- Albania striker Jasir Asani has an ankle injury and could be in doubt for the match. However, the Albanian Football Federation said all players took part in training on Monday.\n\n-- Both teams are treating the match as crucial for their ability to advance from the group stage.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- Croatia had 54% possession in its first match against Spain, becoming the first team to hold the ball more than Spain in a competitive match since 2008. Croatia completed 528 passes to Spain's 392.\n\n-- Albania's Nedim Bajrami scored against Italy after just 23 seconds, the fastest goal in the history of the European Championship.\n\n-- Croatia forward Andrej Kramaric will celebrate his 33rd birthday on the day of the match\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n-- \"For me, personally, it's a dream come true to play in front of that many Croatian fans at a major tournament. It was beautiful. I can only promise that we'll give our best in the next games, and fight for our country.\" - Croatia midfielder Lovro Majer about the support of Croatia fans in Germany.\n\n-- \"We are not going to underestimate our opponents. We are in a 'group of death' and we know it is going to be hard to go through. Croatia are a tough team but we are preparing to give it our best.\" - Albania defender Mario Mitaj.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasir_Asani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasir Asani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Mitaj", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mario Mitaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovro_Majer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lovro Majer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Group of death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/8e/58e27d47-b778-50fa-8782-886835536b72/6671537a53e60.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 838, "textEnd": 845}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

With Croatia faltering in their opener, our soccer betting picks see desperation leading to goals galore.\n\nCroatia lost 3-0 to Spain and are desperate for a win that would get them back on track for qualification. Albania are ready to defy the Euro 2024 odds after narrowly missing a huge draw to Italy. Will they punch above their weight once more?\n\nFind out why I see this one being a wide-open affair in my Croatia vs. Albania predictions and Euro 2024 picks for Wednesday, June 19.\n\nCroatia vs Albania picks, predictions, and betting tips\n\nDespite Nedim Bajrami recording the fastest-ever goal at the Euros after just 23 seconds, Albania fell behind Italy in just 15 minutes. What followed the Italian goal was an even fight, with Albania looking always dangerous and ready to trouble the opposition. Sylvinho's side kept harassing its opponent, but no goal was scored until the end of the match.\n\nAlbania doesn't try to do anything revolutionary. They keep it simple and direct, showing their feisty approach can cause headaches even to the most glamorous opponents. Albania didn't top their qualifying group for nothing, as they left the likes of the Czech Republic and Poland behind them. Sylvinho will look to see his side grow in this tournament. If Albania are to stand any chance of progress, they must maximize the outcome of the match against Croatia.\n\nLuka Modric and his teammates are also desperate to win. Spain thrashed them 3-0 and qualification is at risk. The normal, accessible points in this group are considered those against Albania. A mature and capable team like Croatia, who played so many big tournaments and had great success at the last two World Cups, can't be underestimated.\n\nThe match on Wednesday will be the first international game between Albania and Croatia. The latter never started a final tournament with two straight defeats, nor have they lost successive group-stage encounters. Another detail to help Croatia's case is that they never lost their second match in a European final tournament (W2, D4).\n\nBut they could only keep a clean sheet in their last 13 games at the Euros. Only one of Croatia's previous 23 Euro matches finished in a 0-0 draw (vs. Switzerland in the opening match at Euro 2004). Albania have scored in the first half of their last two Euro outings, also being the team to take the lead.\n\nThis game has \"goals\" written all over it, so I'll opt for the Over 2.5 at a more than decent +100 from Betano.\n\nCroatia vs Albania same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nThis is set to be an open game, with much excitement awaited even for a neutral viewer.\n\nAlbania are not the type of team that parks the bus, and they are not easy to discourage either. Sylvinho's boys will keep pushing even if Croatia takes the lead. Croatia are expected to change their defensive line composition after a disappointing result vs. Spain, with Gvardiol moving into a central role instead of playing as left-back. We expect goals, so expect lots of attacks in this game.\n\nThere were eight corners in the game between Italy and Albania, while we only saw five in the Spain vs Croatia clash, all of which belonged to Spain. Croatia's game needs to change, they need to attack and get the points, as well as the goals that can influence the final standings in the group. Action in the opposition's last third often translates into a serious amount of chances coming in from corners too. A parlay including Over 8.5 corners looks attractive.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sylvinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/bffbb13d-c5ec-4833-8a01-945549652998.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 617, "textEnd": 624}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

A remarkable game ended in a draw greeted with euphoria by Albania, but which at half-time would have seemed a dreadful disappointment.\n\nRelated: Croatia 2-2 Albania: Euro 2024 - live\n\nCroatia had lost to Spain. They had been largely outplayed by a younger and sharper Albania side in the first half. But they have a capacity to hang in games and tournaments until their talent eventually blossoms. At half-time here there seemed a very real possibility they could go out in the group stage. Albania deserved their lead. But something always happens: Argentina try to play a high press with Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, Scotland panic at the thought of at last getting out of a group, Romelu Lukaku suffers one of the all-time days of profligacy, Gjasula scores a ludicrous own goal. For once, though, that was not the end of the story.\n\nAlbania deserve great credit not only for their first-half performance but for holding their nerve. The build-up to Gjasula's equaliser was clam and incisive. They had already had a couple of late opportunities but there was no panic. They trusted their talent and got their rewards. Once again they had impressed. Once again they had taken the lead. But as against Italy, they then conceded twice. This time, though, they converted their late opportunity. Even if they lose to Spain, they will leave this tournament having made more of an impression than they did in France eight years ago in their one previous Euros, even though they won a game then.\n\nThe Croatia coach, Zlatko Dalic, had complained that his side deserve more respect having achieved three podium finishes in the past six years (he includes the Nations League). He may have a point, but Croatia might seem more convincing challengers for this tournament if they weren not still, Josko Gvardiol aside, so dependent on the side that lost in the 2018 World Cup final.\n\nUsually when three men with the combined age of Croatia's midfield get together, it's for a game of bowls, some reminiscing about a wild night a couple of decades ago (\"Luka, tell us that one about Scott Carson again\"), or a couple of gentle pints and a proper grumble about the scourge of progress. The midfield is becoming a problem for them. Sublimely gifted as their trio were, they lack the bite or energy of a modern group. It couldn't endure and Marcelo Brozovic was one of two players replaced at half-time as Croatia switched to a 4-2-3-1.\n\nWhat Spain had done, so did Albania before half-time. Their three attacking midfielders all found space repeatedly and were able to isolate Croatian defenders and drive at them. That was what brought the opening goal, after 11 minutes. With Ivan Perisic, slightly surprisingly deployed at left-back, slow to get out, Jasir Asani was granted a remarkable amount of space to bend in a cross from the right, picking out Qazim Laci. His header bounced awkwardly for Dominik Livakovic but the keeper should still surely have kept it out. Given Laci's only previous competitive goal for his country had come in a World Cup qualifier against San Marino, it's safe to say this was by some margin the most important goal he has ever scored.\n\nAlbania could have been further ahead by half-time as well, Kristjan Asllani slightly snatching at a chance as Asani's pass was deflected into his path after Luka Modric had, unthinkably, conceded possession, and then Rey Manaj could not get sufficient purchase on a header to beat Livakovic. You cannot afford not to finish off Croatia if you have the chance.\n\nIn the first half on Wednesday, Croatia were not even generating opportunities. They had more of the ball but struggled to break Albania down. Only after the break with the change of shape did they begin to create. One substitute Luka Sucic forced a plunging save from Thomas Strakosha and another substitute Mario Pasalic headed a decent chance over, before Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, his shot squeezing between the legs of Elseid Hysaj. Having resisted for so long, Albania buckled. Although Pasalic's shot was blocked it cannoned back off the luckless Gjasula and in.\n\nBut there was one twist left. Albania found a second wind. Croatia were left clinging on. And then, suddenly, they weren't any more and Gjasula had scored.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romelu Lukaku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Asllani", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristjan Asllani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasir_Asani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasir Asani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elseid_Hysaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elseid Hysaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_Manaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rey Manaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Peri\u0161i\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marino_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Marino national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Strakosha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Strakosha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/60cdeeae249e3cbae2954eb894a1fb2f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-03-01", "textStart": 2631, "textEnd": 2638}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Kirstjan Asllani sent in a wonderful ball from the right, which Qazim Laci (11) nodded home.\n\nThey continued to impress in the first half - missing a string of glorious opportunities - while Croatia failed to register a shot on target.\n\nBut Croatia scored two quick-fire goals in an improved second half to see themselves ahead.

Albania scored a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser to deny Croatia a victory that severely dents the 2018 World Cup finalists' hopes of reaching the knockout stage of Euro 2024.\n\nIn what was a chaotic but entertaining end to the game, the Albanians rescued a point when Klaus Gjasula side-footed home in the 95th minute to send their supporters wild.\n\nIt had looked like the game would finish in heartbreak for Albania, having let slip another early lead.\n\nQazim Laci struck in the 11th minute and his side then defended superbly for over an hour as they looked on the verge of producing a major upset.\n\nBut Croatia turned around an incredible game at Hamburg's Volksparkstadion when former Leicester forward Andrej Kramaric drove in an equaliser, before Luka Sucic's shot deflected off Gjasula and into the Albania net.\n\nBut Gjasula had the final say with his late strike, which means Croatia will now need to beat defending champions Italy in their final Group B game to have a chance of progressing.\n\nAlbania face a tough test in their next game against Spain, but this is a performance and result that will live long in the memory of their fans.\n\nAlbania rewarded for no-fear display\n\nThere have been some hugely entertaining games at this European Championship and this stands among the best of them.\n\nThat is in a large part down to Albania and the determination their side has put in so far in Germany to show they are not here to make up the numbers.\n\nThis is their second appearance at a Euros after qualifying in 2016, and their fans have certainly made the most of their return.\n\nIn Hamburg before kick-off supporters packed out walkways on the harbourfront, and when in the stadium they produced incredible noise throughout the game.\n\nThat energy was clearly transferred to the players, whose fast-paced counter-attacking football had Croatia rattled, and their 1-0 lead at half-time was fully deserved.\n\nWhen Croatia scored twice to turn things around, it will have sparked a sense of deja vu among the Albania fans, having seen Italy fight back to beat them in their first game.\n\nBut this time they did not wilt and instead pushed hard for the equaliser in the closing stages, before Gjasula got the reward his side's battling display deserved.\n\nEnd of an era approaching for Croatia?\n\nHaving finished runners-up at the World Cup in 2018, then reaching the semi-final of the tournament four years later, it seems unthinkable that this Croatia team could fall at the first hurdle in Germany.\n\nGranted, they were drawn in a tough group with Spain and Italy but they would have targeted this game as a must-win to at least give them the chance of progressing as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nThey are a side brimming with talented players, led by the talismanic Luka Modric, who have taken them far at past tournaments.\n\nBut many of those are now over 30 and it is starting to look like time might be catching up on the veteran players.\n\nFor too long in this game they failed to match the mobility and tempo of their opponents and, while the turnaround was impressive - if somewhat fortunate through the own goal - they should then have had enough to see the game out.\n\nBut instead they sat back and that proved costly as Albania once again found their energy to push on and snatch the dramatic equaliser.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital FM Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri": "timothy_olobulu@capitalfm.co.ke", "name": "Timothy Olobulu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alex_isaboke@capitalfm.co.ke", "name": "Alex Isaboke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksparkstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volksparkstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/files/2024/06/GQcFjYbX0AAdrit-720x576.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 18, "textEnd": 25}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

For large periods, they had Croatia on the ropes.\n\nAnd make no mistake, Croatia were woeful at times and should consider themselves lucky to still have a pulse in Germany.\n\nTheir starting XI average age of 30 years and one day points to the fact that their Golden Generation of talent looks to be at an end.\n\nAnd skipper Luca Modric - who turns 39 in September - may well be retiring off the back of this miserable Euros campaign, perhaps sooner than expected.\n\nBefore this one, the greatest Euros upset in terms of world rankings came on Monday, as Slovakia in 48th beat Belgium in third.\n\nAlbania - the second lowest ranked in the competition in 66th - came agonisingly close to smashing that record out of the water against tenth-placed Croatia.\n\nWhat a job former Arsenal full-back Sylvinho has done since taking charge of Albania in January 2023. Guiding them here was success in itself, but taking Italy and Croatia all the way in the toughest of groups? Ludicrous.\n\nThe Albanians were ahead against the Italians after just 23 seconds before losing 2-1.\n\nThey could not replicate that speed against Croatia, but it was still a fast start via Laci - one of two changes Sylvinho made alongside Armando Broja dropping out for Rey Manaj.\n\nLaci drifted into the box unmarked and glanced Jasir Asani's superb cross towards goal. Domink Livakovic was behind it but unable to stop it dribbling through his hands.\n\nCroatia simply were not at the races, bizarre considering the magnitude of this result. Dalic had tried to spice things with three changes from the Spain disappointment.\n\nIvan Perisic returned at left-back with Josko Gvardiol shifting to a more familiar centre back role while Bruno Petkovic led the line in place of Ante Budimir.\n\nThere was experience and nous all over the park, but Albania were covering the grass like their lives depended on it, hitting Croatia on the counter and defending valiantly.\n\nWhile Croatia were toothless and lacking ideas, Albania should have doubled their lead in the 30th minute as Kristjan Asllani raced through but Livakovic stood firm.\n\nRemarkably, another chance went begging as Gvardiol clumsily lost the ball but Manaj's subsequent header lacked power.\n\nDalic responded at half time with two changes - Mario Pasalic and Luka Sucic on for Marcelo Brozovic and Lovro Majer.\n\nCroatia began to dominate proceedings with Albania dropping deep and defending their lead. Petkovic and Mateo Kovacic were denied by Thomas Strakosha.\n\nAnd then, the comeback. Kramaric was fed by another sub in Budimir, cutting inside before finding the bottom corner - a first Euros goal to celebrate his 33rd birthday.\n\nGjasula's own goal has to be seen to be believed, Budimir's cut-back cleared by Berat Djimsiti but into his own man as it ballooned into his own net.\n\nAlbania found a second wind, however, and Gjasula responded in the best possible way, belting past Livakovic with seconds remaining.\n\nDalic demanded the same amount of respect that England get before this game.

Unluckiest own goal? Can Albania go through?", "body": "Just when it looked as though Croatia had disproved their doubters by coming from behind to beat Albania, they let it slip at the end.\n\nAs against Italy in their first game, Albania scored with their first shot. Against Italy, it was after just 23 seconds. This time, it came after 11 minutes. But despite struggling in the first half, Croatia took the lead in the second half, with Andrej Kramaric equalising before an unfortunate own goal shortly after.\n\nBut then Klaus Gjasula, who had scored the own goal, equalised to rescue a 2-2 draw for Albania.\n\nBoth sides, with one point each and one game to play, can still reach the knockouts.\n\nThe Athletic's Carl Anka, Tim Spiers and Dermot Corrigan break down the action.\n\nFor much of this game, there was an 'end of an era' mood about this Croatia performance.\n\nDespite the 3-0 defeat against Spain in the opener, Croatia's ageing midfield three of Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic and Mateo Kovacic started again together today, and their opening half was again disappointing.\n\nCroatia's attacks were either too slow or had too many players haring forward helter-skelter. Every time a move broke down, the better-organised Albanians counter-attacked dangerously.\n\nDalic has shown a lot of faith in players he knows so well, but he knew changes were required. Brozovic, now at Al Sadd in Saudi Arabia, was hooked at half-time, along with Lovro Majer.\n\nAs the half progressed, Croatia started to push Albania deeper and deeper. Modric especially kept looking to make things happen, but the 38-year-old saw a shot blocked, while Kovacic hit his chance too close to Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha.\n\nDalic kept making changes, and gradually they started to open up gaps in the Albania defence, with the addition of another centre-forward in Osasuna's Ante Budimir proving crucial.\n\nFive minutes after entering, Budimir teed up Kramaric, to wrongfoot Strakosha from 15 yards. Now the momentum was all with Croatia, as a squad who have been through so many battles together rallied once more. Budimir's run and cross led to panic in the Albanian defence, and defender Klaus Gjasula had the final touch to his own net.\n\nAll the changes left Croatia even more disorganised however, and Albania were not done yet either. 2-2 was probably a fair result given how the game went and kept both side's hopes alive going into their final games.\n\nCroatia had not lost consecutive games at a major tournament since Euro 1996 - a run that remained intact amid all the late drama. Whether Dalic's side go much further remains in question, they will probably now need to beat Italy on Monday to progress.\n\nDermot Corrigan\n\nOh Albania. You can praise Croatia for persistence and spirit and generating the most quickfire of turnarounds, but for the goal that gave them the lead, Albania panicked and crumbled under pressure.\n\nAfter Kramaric's equaliser the Albanians were trying to get set in their defensive shape as Croatia attacked again, flailing their arms appealing for a foul that never came, but goodness did they have a stroke of huge misfortune too.\n\nElseid Hysaj was too weak in the challenge, allowing Ante Budimir the chance to pull back for Luka Sucic, but his free shot was heroically blocked by captain Berat Djimsiti only for the ball to ricochet off substitute Klaus Gjasula and into the net. (Gjasula, however, would redeem himself in added time.)\n\nHe was unlucky, the ball could have gone anywhere, but it rolled over the line and became the latest hugely unlucky own goal at this tournament.\n\nThink Germany's Antonio Rudiger heading a cut back into his own net, Austrian Maximilian Wober doing the same or Robin Hranac for the Czech Republic against Portugal.\n\nThis one felt like the cruellest. Albania, just like against Italy, were ahead and could have pulled off the greatest result in their footballing history. Though they missed out on that chance, they at least rescued a point through that man again, Gjasula.\n\nTim Spiers\n\nGjasula made up for his own goal by sweeping home the equaliser from the penalty spot. The celebrations were just as raucous as you would expect, with Albania coach Sylvinho racing down the sideline and jumping into the arms of an assistant.\n\nWith both teams now completely disorganised, Gjasula had another chance from the edge of the box, but the shot was blocked. Seconds later it was Croatia on the attack, with Modric breaking dangerously from half-way, and up popped Gjasula with a lunge which did not make contact, but the evasive action required to save his legs meant the Madrid midfielder lost the ball.\n\nIt was a deserved yellow card for the Darmstadt midfielder, who had quite a second half. It was yet another barnstorming game at this tournament, and Gjasula is another previously unheralded name to have made a big impact on everyone watching.\n\nThere's the seed of something good in this Albania side. Sylvinho and Pablo Zabaleta have made for one of the more entertaining dugout duos in a while, and they have helped construct a side that battles hard, but can encounter difficulties in both penalties areas.\n\nBajrami's early goal against Italy, and Laci's lovely near post header against Croatia showed us what this team can do at their peak, but there is only so far a counter-attacking team can go when they lack a clinical edge in front of goal. Mirlind Daku spooned mis-hit in the 88th minute was the sort of chance a team looking to go through as third-place qualifiers cannot miss.\n\nAnother goalline scramble in the 90th minute, ending with Daku inadvertently volleying the side of Josko Gvardiol's head, looked to be the rubber stamp on a gutting defeat.\n\nBut then, minutes from time, they got their angles right on the cross. The pull-back pass from Mitaj on the left was delightful. Gjasula's late run into the penalty box was perfect. The goal saw Hamburg's stadium erupt in noise and hugs.\n\nIf Albania manage to get out of this group as third-place qualifiers, then they would face either the winner of Group E (the chaos group containing Belgium), or F (which could be topped by Turkey or Portugal).\n\nThere's a good Plan A to this Albania team. For much of the first half they carefully contained Croatia's play and often outfought them for second balls. Kristijan Allani gave a glimpse as to why he will likely be Marcelo Brozovic's successor at Inter Milan. The 22-year-old is composed in possession and combative out of it. There's clever passing between all the physical counter-pressing. All they need is a more dynamic goalscoring option up front (it was telling that Armando Broja was an unused sub).", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

Klaus Gjasula of Albania scored at both ends, including a dramatic equaliser in injury time.\n\nAlbania took an early lead through Qazim Laci, but Croatia improved in the second half after making two substitutions at half-time.\n\nAndrej Kramaric levelled the score with 16 minutes remaining, and Gjasula then put through his own net. However, the Albania midfielder redeemed himself by scoring in the fifth minute of injury time to secure a point for his team.\n\nCroatia, semi-finalists at the 2022 World Cup, will likely need a victory against holders Italy in their final Group B match on June 24 to progress to the knockout phase for a fifth consecutive major tournament.\n\nAlbania, despite earning praise for their performances against Italy and Croatia, have been unable to hold onto leads in both games and will probably need to defeat Spain to keep their last-16 hopes alive.\n\nCroatia's lacklustre first-half display ultimately cost them, and their 'golden generation' is now in danger of exiting the tournament in disappointing fashion.\n\nCoach Zlatko Dalic made no changes to his formation from the Spain defeat, but brought in Ivan Perisic at left-back and moved Josko Gvardiol into central defence.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the stadium was electric, with supporters of both teams creating one of the best ambiences of the tournament so far. Albania started quickly, as they did against Italy, with Laci scoring in the 11th minute from a Jasir Asani cross.\n\nCroatia struggled to impose their passing game, and Albania continued to look more dangerous, with Kristjan Asllani and Rey Manaj missing excellent opportunities to extend their lead.\n\nDalic's half-time substitutions, Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic, brought about an improvement in Croatia's performance. However, Albania remained a threat on the counter-attack, with Nedim Bajrami going close in the 67th minute.\n\nKramaric finally found the equaliser for Croatia in the 74th minute, cutting inside and finishing into the near post. Two minutes later, Gjasula's own goal appeared to complete the turnaround, but Albania refused to give up.\n\nGjasula made amends by scoring the equaliser in injury time, and both sides threw bodies forward in search of a winner, but to no avail.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

The game saw a dramatic own goal and a late equalizer, leaving both teams in a tough spot in Group B.\n\nIn a gripping encounter at Euro 2024, Croatia and Albania played to a thrilling 2-2 draw on Wednesday, marking the first-ever competitive match between the two Balkan nations.\n\nAlbania's Qazim Laci set the early pace, heading in a cross from the right in the 11th minute to give Albania a surprising lead. However, Croatia's persistence paid off when Andrej Kramaric found the net about halfway through the second half. Just two minutes later, an own goal by Klaus Gjasula turned the tables in Croatia's favor at 2-1.\n\nThe drama peaked in extra-time when Gjasula redeemed himself by scoring the equalizer for Albania, leaving both teams in a precarious situation in Group B after their earlier losses to Spain and Italy. This result complicates their respective paths to the next stage of the tournament.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Drawing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Drawing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/19_06_2024_15_20_05_79915.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Croatians can make amends | LiveScore", "body": "- Six match Croatian unbeaten run came to an end in opening Group B clash\n\n- Albania scored fastest ever European Championship goal in Italy defeat\n\n- Recommended bet: Croatia/Croatia at half-time/full-time\n\nBoth Croatia and Albania are looking for their first points in Group B, after tasting losses in their first games of the tournament.\n\nThe Croats were beaten 3-0 by Spain in a match in which they missed a penalty and then had the converted rebound disallowed, while Albania's early lead was quickly wiped out by an Italian side that won 2-1.\n\nCroatia looked leaky in defence, bringing into question manager Zlatko Dalic's decision to employ Josko Gvardiol at left-back, rather than the central defensive role in which he excelled at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nBorna Sosa could come in on the left and see Gvardiol moved centrally, while Marcelo Brozovic's midfield place is under threat, with Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic potential replacements.\n\nThe Albania forward Jasir Asana is a doubt with an ankle injury.\n\nCroatia have now lost three of their last five competitive matches, winning twice.\n\nAlbania's friendly wins over Liechtenstein and Azerbaijan are their only victories from their last seven games.\n\nCroatia have not lost consecutive games at an international tournament since Euro 96.\n\nThough Croatia suffered a heavy defeat against Spain, they have reason to be optimistic as they enter this crucial clash with Albania.\n\nDalic's team managed to have slightly more possession than their opponents and enjoyed 16 shots compared to Spain's 11.\n\nCroatia came close on several occasions, with Bruno Petkovic missing a penalty and then seeing his conversion from the rebound, ruled out for encroachment.\n\nIf they can be more clinical and cut out their defensive errors, they can be confident of picking up a win, that will see them go into their final group game against Italy with a chance of making the knockout stages.\n\nCroatia only have to look at Italy's match against Albania to see what might happen if they are once again so generous with their defending.\n\nA wayward throw-in saw Nedim Bajrami convert with just 23 seconds on the clock and though the Albanians struggled to create chances, Rey Manaj came close to equalising towards the end of the game.\n\nAlbania only had 31.7% of the possession against Italy, which suggests that the Croats could dominate the ball to an even greater degree.\n\nIf Croatia can show more composure than was the case against Spain, they should win this one with some ease.\n\nBack Croatia/Croatia at half-time/full-time at 59/50 with LiveScore Bet.\n\nWin up to \u00a3250,000 with our free-to-play game, LiveScore 6!", "source":

They face Italy on Monday.\n\nWhat a thrilling game in Hamburg. Croatia will be kicking themselves especially after doing so well to turn things around in the second half. Albania looked tired late on but they held on and got their equaliser. The story of the day was Gjasula who came on as a substitute in a stadium he used to play in regularly with Hamburg, scored a devastating O.G. then went up the other end and salvaged a point for his country in dramatic fashion. Brilliant.\n\nAm I watching the NBA play-offs or the Euros? It's like a game of basketball now, end to end stuff. Albania have one last stab then Croatia do the same, Kovacic's shot saved and the final whistle goes. I really didn't want that game to end. This is what the Euros is all about.\n\nGjasula with a late late equaliser and redemption! It looked for a while there like Albania were dead and buried but they've pulled it out of the hat. What a game! Gvardiol is on the turf, head in hands, as are the thousands of Croatian fans in the stadium.\n\nDaku has two goes in a chaotic box scramble. He finally blasts it over.\n\nAlbania with a big chance to equalise. Hoxha's effort is parried into the path of sub Mirlind Daku but his follow-up from close range is blasted over. Flag goes up for a offside though.\n\nModric goes for one from range but it goes just wide. Would have been the cherry on top. Baturina takes on his man on the left edge of the box, he hits a shot while falling but the keeper saves.\n\nCroatia subs: Kramaric and Perisic make way for Sosa and Baturina.\n\nAll Croatia now. Albania wilting rapidly. Perisic's crossing today has been nothing short of sublime. He floats in another beauty that nearly gets to Budamir. Speaking of Budamir, he's been fantastic since coming on, making all the difference. They needed a big second half Croatia, and they have delivered.\n\nThey've turned it around! And what a calamitous goal it is. Gjasula own goal. Budamir beats his man on the end line and plays it to Pasalic with an open goal. The shot is blocked but the clearance deflects off the substitute and flies into his own net. Have to feel for the Albanians.\n\nKramaric finally finds the net! Albania's resistance broken. Kovacic flicks it to Budamir who plays in Kramaric. The former Leicester man slots home and they're level.\n\nGoalscorer Laci makes way for 34-year-old Gjasula. Juranovic loses it near his own area, its stolen by Bajrami but his effort is weak.\n\nPerisic with another cross from wide left, met by Petkovic but no luck. Budimir on for Petkovic for Croatia.\n\nBajrami takes on Gvardiol, waits for him to commit but the Manchester City defender doesn't so he tries his luck. The ball goes high, right and wide. At least the Albanians are starting to find their way back into the game now.\n\nLaci is fuming. The Albanians steal possession in the Croatian half, Laci is free in space with the potential of a one-on-one but they play the ball backwards. Dumbfounded.\n\nCroatia continue to pile on the pressure here. Albania struggling to get out of their own half, being forced backward on every attempt to break. When they do finally get out Aslani has a go from the edge of the area but it is underhit and Livakovic gathers happily.\n\nSeferi comes on for Asani for the Albanians.\n\nModric hits a piledriver right into the midriff of Amadani. The referee stops play. Andros Townsend makes his discontentment known on ITV commentary.\n\n\"I wouldn't be stopping the game for that\"\n\n\"Does a football to the stomach count as a serious injury?\"\n\nAlbania yet to threaten in this half so far but they've already shown they don't need many chances to score. Croatia very much in control at the moment though. Another cross, another header, no goal but a corner for Croatia. Modric whips it in and somehow Sutelo missed from centimeters with a free header. Modric can't believe his eyes.\n\nKovacic tries one from just outside the area. It is deflected but it doesn't phase Strakosha who stays central and catches with ease. Perisic with yet another cross into the box but no one there to head it home.\n\nThe ball finds its way to Sucic in the box, great opportunity but it is hit straight at the keeper. Perisic flies one into the danger area. It's met by Pasalic who heads wide. Croatia getting a foothold now.\n\nPerisic with another long throw into the area. Petkovic rises to meet again but it goes wide for a goal kick.\n\nSucic involved already. He crosses to Petkovic who can't connect properly with his head to guide it goalwards.\n\nSucic and Pasalic come on for Majer and Brozovic. Fresh legs clearly needed by Croatia especially in the midfield. 45 minutes left for Croatia to save their tournament - and reputation.\n\nAlbania will be more than happy with that first-half display. They've got their goal, created plenty of chances, looked dangerous whenever they've entered the Croatian half and managed to keep their oppositions attacking force at bay. More of the same in the second half one would assume.\n\nManaj has a great chance in front of goal. Cross whipped in by Hysaj onto the forehead of Manaj who heads it into the ground. Livakovic saves well again. Seconds later Croatia attack. Perisic's cross is met by Petkovic and saved wonderfully by Strakosha. The referee blows up anyway for offside. Half-time.\n\nKramaric sends in another one, this time to Majer. It looks like the Albanian defender gets a touch on it but the linesman gives a goal kick.\n\nKovacic loses possession leading to a quick Albania counter. It is quelled but they hold possession. The Albanian crowd are drowning out the Croatian chants. Kramaric beats his man a couple of times on the edge of the box before crossing it into nobody in the box.\n\nModric sends the free in but Strakosha punches away. Long ball is played over the top to Asani from a quick free but he fails to control it. Brozovic has a go down the other end but it trickles into the keepers gloves.\n\nCroatia have yet to test Albanian keeper Strakosha. They play around with the ball in the middle of the park. They certainly have players who can hurt an opposition, when will they get their first big chance of the game? They have a free on the edge of the area now. Could this be it?\n\nWhat a chance for Albania! Ball played through to Asllani who is one-on-one with Livakovic but the keeper stays tall and saves the midfielder's effort. Could so easily have been two.\n\nFree for Albania. It's a bit long but Bajrami manages to find Laci whose cross is cleared. Asani finds Manaj in the box who heads it down to Hysaj. The defender hits it first time on the half-volley but it flies over. Albania still looking the more dangerous in attack.\n\nMajer floats in another lethal cross off his left, right onto the head of Petkovic but the striker can't guide it goalwards and it goes over the crossbar.\n\nModric pulling the strings in midfield as expected. Croatia put some nice link-up play together. They're starting to look a bit more productive in possession (they currently have 63 percent of it). Twice they get close to the box but the Albanians break down their attack.\n\nEnd to end again. Bajrami in a foot race with Sutelo but the Croatian clears. Kramaric finds himself in a similar situation down the other end but the defenders do their job. Juranovic has a go from the edge of the area but it drags just wide.\n\nPerisic launches a long throw into the box, dangerous but cleared. Perisic whips in another cross seconds later but the Albanians deal.\n\nAlbania appeal for a penalty but the referee is having none of it. Down the other end Modric steals the ball from a napping Mitaj but Arlind Ajeti kicks it out, stopping a potential Croatia attack.\n\nCroatia looking so open and vulnerable at the moment. Bajrami cuts in from the left and unleashes one but the keeper palms it into the side netting. Hysaj attempts the spectacular from the outside of the box but it is blocked.\n\nIt's been a pretty fast start to the game from both sides. Hysaj curls in a cross that Sutelo fails to properly clear. The ball is played back out to the midfield. It's whipped in once more from the right hand side and met by Laci in the box who heads it past Livakovic. Another early goal for the Albanians!\n\nCroatia with their first period of pressure. Maher cross cleared from corner. Ivanovic tries to find Petkovic with another cross from wide but cleared once more. Hysaj loses the ball to Kovacic on the edge of the area but they quickly win it back.\n\nAlbania again looking sharp in the Croatian half. They win a free 35 yards out, the ball is clipped in to Asani by Manaj but Sutalo heads it back to the keeper.\n\nAlbania stringing some nice passes together in the opening phase of play, looking confident. Ball played over the top to Bajrami who crosses low but it is cleared by Gvardiol.\n\nAnd we're off...\n\nBoth teams belt out their national anthems with pride as the sun beats down in Hamburg. Kick-off in three minutes.\n\nAlbania coach Sylvinho spoke during the week, touching on his approach to games against bigger teams.\n\n\"I have seen other sides in this tournament. If you try and go toe-to-toe with them, they will score five or six against you,\" said the former Arsenal and Barcelona defender.\n\n\"It's only our second time here in the Euros. We have young players, very good players, but it's not easy.\"\n\nThe Albanian team has been announced prior to kick-off and there's is neither sight nor sound of Chelsea striker Armando Broja in the starting 11, perhaps their most recognisable player.\n\nCroatia's Euro hopes have been dealt a blow with midfielder Nikola Vlasic ruled out of the tournament through injury.\n\nThe 26-year-old Torino midfielder, formerly of West Ham and Everton, picked up a muscle injury in training. Vlasic has been capped 56 times for his country.\n\nFollowing a scan, Vlasic said he will now be heading home.\n\n\"I'm extremely sorry that this new injury will prevent me from helping the team,\" Vlasic said.\n\n\"I've done everything possible to be ready, and I'd like to thank the head coach and the coaching staff for the opportunity. I believe in this team and I'm sure they will succeed - I'll be their biggest fan!\".\n\nCroatia have lost three of their past five competitive matches, going down against Turkey, Wales and Spain in this run. It is is as many defeats as they had suffered across their previous 29 games in competitive action combined. They'll need to turn that form around if they are to escape the Euro 2024 group stages.\n\nGood afternoon everybody and welcome to the Telegraph's live blog of the Group B clash between Croatia and Albania at the Volksparkstadion in Hamburg. We will be taking you through every moment, every bulge of the net, every woodwork hit and every crunching tackle made as Croatia aim to bounce back from their disappointing 3-0 defeat to Spain in the tournament's opening round of matches.\n\nAs for the Albanians, they nearly caused a mighty upset in their opening encounter with Italy, scoring after just 23 seconds, but the current European champions turned it around in true Azzurri fashion, eventually winning 2-1 thanks to goals from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella.\n\nDespite their underwhelming display against Spain, the Croatian squad are well used to playing on the biggest stage and will no doubt be favourites for this. Zlatko Dalic's side reached the 2018 World Cup final and the penultimate stages in Qatar in 2022.\n\nThey have recovered from slow starts before, progressing from the group stage at Euro 2020 despite losing to England in their opening game, and as previously mentioned at the last World Cup they reached the semi-finals after an opening loss to Morocco.\n\n\"There is no room for pessimism, everything is still in our hands,\" Dalic said. \"Of course, we have to be better. It's my job to turn the team around\" he continued.\n\nTheir goal difference surely isn't doing them any favours in the group but a big win in Hamburg today can make up for it, especially with Italy taking on Spain tomorrow night.\n\nEuro 2024 has brought us plenty of goals thus far, let's hope that continues today.

Croatia a victory that severely dents the 2018 World Cup finalists' hopes of reaching the knockout stage of Euro 2024.\n\nContentsAlbania rewarded for no-fear displayEnd of an era approaching for Croatia?\n\nIn what was a chaotic but entertaining end to the game, the Albanians rescued a point when Klaus Gjasula side-footed home in the 95th minute to send their supporters wild.\n\nIt had looked like the game would finish in heartbreak for Albania, having let slip another early lead.\n\nQazim Laci struck in the 11th minute and his side then defended superbly for over an hour as they looked on the verge of producing a major upset.\n\nBut Croatia turned around an incredible game at Hamburg's Volksparkstadion when former Leicester forward Andrej Kramaric drove in an equaliser, before Luka Sucic's shot deflected off Gjasula and into the Albanian net.\n\nBut Gjasula had the final say with his late strike, which means Croatia will now need to beat defending champions Italy in their final Group B game to have a chance of progressing.\n\nAlbania face a tough test in their next game against Spain, but this is a performance and result that will live long in the memory of their fans.\n\nAlbania rewarded for no-fear display\n\nThere have been some hugely entertaining games at this European Championship and this stands among the best of them.\n\nThat is in a large part down to Albania and the determination their side has put in so far in Germany to show they are not here to make up the numbers.\n\nThis is their second appearance at the Euros after qualifying in 2016, and their fans have certainly made the most of their return.\n\nIn Hamburg, before kick-off, supporters packed out walkways on the harbourfront, and when in the stadium, they produced incredible noise throughout the game.\n\nThat energy was clearly transferred to the players, whose fast-paced counter-attacking football had Croatia rattled, and their 1-0 lead at half-time was fully deserved.\n\nWhen Croatia scored twice to turn things around, it will have sparked a sense of deja vu among the Albanian fans, having seen Italy fight back to beat them in their first game.\n\nBut this time they did not wilt and instead pushed hard for the equaliser in the closing stages, before Gjasula got the reward his side's battling display deserved.\n\nEnd of an era approaching for Croatia?\n\nHaving finished runners-up at the World Cup in 2018, then reaching the semi-final of the tournament four years later, it seems unthinkable that this Croatian team could fall at the first hurdle in Germany.\n\nGranted, they were drawn in a tough group with Spain and Italy but they would have targeted this game as a must-win to at least give them the chance of progressing as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nThey are a side brimming with talented players, led by the talismanic Luka Modric, who have taken them far at past tournaments.\n\nBut many of those are now over 30 and it is starting to look like time might be catching up on the veteran players.\n\nFor too long in this game, they failed to match the mobility and tempo of their opponents and, while the turnaround was impressive -- if somewhat fortunate through their own goal -- they should then have had enough to see the game out.\n\nBut instead they sat back and that proved costly as Albania once again found their energy to push on and snatch the dramatic equaliser.", "source": {"uri": "newmail-ng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Mail Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The result leaves both sides on one point each heading into the final round of group games, with progression to the knockout stages still up for grabs.\n\nThe underdogs got off to a dream start in Bucharest, taking a surprise 11th-minute lead through Qazim La\u00e7i's near-post header. Croatia pushed hard for an equaliser but struggled to create clear chances as Albania defended resolutely and looked threatening on the counter-attack.\n\nCroatia finally levelled in the 74th minute when Andrej Kramari\u0107 fired home on his birthday. Substitute Ante Budimir then turned the game around, his cut-back leading to an own goal by Klaus Gjasula. Yet, there was late drama as Gjasula atoned for his error by heading home deep into stoppage time to snatch an unlikely point for Albania.\n\nWhile Croatia avoided their first back-to-back losses at a major tournament since Euro 96, they will likely need a result against defending champions Italy to secure a knockout round spot. As for Albania, Sylvinho's side have it all to play for against Spain after this morale-boosting fightback.\n\nThe final Group B games take place on Monday, with Croatia facing Italy and Albania taking on Spain.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jude_obafemi@thewillnews.com", "name": "Jude Obafemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Budimir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ante Budimir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Kramari\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrej Kramari\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bucharest"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bucharest"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_3315.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Photograph: Carmen Jaspersen/Reuters\n\nCroatia's fans have been spoiled for success in recent years, but they could be forgiven for wondering whether the side that turns up at the European Championships bears any resemblance to their World Cup overachievers.\n\nTheir Euro 2024 hopes were left hanging by a thread after another sleepy display against Albania on Wednesday in which they switched off at key moments and failed to put their opponents to the sword in a 2-2 draw.\n\nFor a brief time in the second half, they played with the same style and thrust as the teams that reached the World Cup final in 2018 and the semis four years later.\n\nBut for all of the first half and the final 10 minutes of the second they resembled the Croatia that has never been past the quarter-finals at the European Championship and fell in the last 16 at the previous two editions.\n\nAfter their 3-0 defeat by Spain in their Group B opener, Croatia needed a fast start. Instead they produced the opposite, falling behind after 11 minutes when Qazim Laci ghosted in and glanced home a header that Croatia keeper Dominik Livakovic should have kept out.\n\nWhat followed was a soporific display of the art of passing for passing's sake. If passing teams to death was a successful strategy then Croatia would be football's most lethal executioners. But hogging the ball in the first half with over 60% possession got them nowhere.\n\nIt was a similar story in their opener when they had more possession than Spain -- the first team to do so in 136 competitive matches since the Euro 2008 final -- but ended up losing 3-0.\n\nLike a medieval army picking an elevated spot to engage in battle, Albania were happy to concede territory up the field in favour of packing the final third, safe in the knowledge that Croatia would not hurt them.\n\nIMAGE: Albania's Klaus Gjasula celebrates scoring their equaliser. Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/Reuters\n\nThat strategy fell apart in the second half, however, after Croatia brought on substitutes Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic in the break and looked almost unrecognisable as they tore into their opponents.\n\nThey levelled when Andrej Kramaric shot through the legs of Elseid Hysaj into the bottom corner in the 73rd minute and took the lead when Albania's Klaus Gjasula saw the ball bounce off him into his own goal.\n\nThat should have been the cue for Croatia to twist the knife or at least shut up shop. Instead they seemed to slacken off and invite the Albanians back into the match.\n\nIt was deep in stoppage time when Albania drew level, with Gjasula drilling his finish hard and low into net to make up for his earlier own goal.\n\nCroatia's fans were silenced and no doubt thinking they had seen this all before at the Euros.\n\nAt Euro 2020, Zlatko Dalic's side conceded twice in extra time in a 5-3 last-16 defeat to Spain, while in 2016 they conceded with three minutes left of extra time against eventual champions Portugal at the same stage.\n\nIn 2012 they didn't escape the group stage after Spain bagged an 88th-minute winner in their final game and there was a similar tale of woe in 2008 when they lost on penalties in the quarters.\n\nThey will now almost certainly need to beat Italy in their final group game on Monday to have any chance of reaching the knockouts.\n\nCroatian fans will be hoping it's their World Cup side who turn up in Leipzig rather than the Euros one that just can't seem to get it right.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elseid_Hysaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elseid Hysaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albanians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/sports/2024/jun/19croatia-deject.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

After Croatia's shock defeat to Spain in Berlin, Croatia needed to win against Albania -- and the fans were out in all of their red-and-white-checkered glory once again. But the Albania fans were out in full force, too.\n\nDali\u0107 made some changes to the lineup compared to the Spain match. Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 started from the first minute at left back, Gvardiol and \u0160utali were paired back at center back, and Juranovi\u0107 at right back. The midfield line stayed the same, and Petkovi\u0107 replaced Budimir up top.\n\nLineups\n\nCroatia: Livakovi\u0107, Juranovi\u0107, \u0160utalo, Gvardiol, Peri\u0161i\u0107, Modri\u0107, Brozovi\u0107, Kova\u010di\u0107, Majer, Kramari\u0107, Petkovi\u0107\n\nAlbania: Strakosha, Hysaj, Djimsiti, Arlind Ajeti, Mitaj, Asllani, Ramadani, Laci, Asani, Manaj, Bajrami\n\nMatch Report\n\nAlbania looked dangerous in the first few minutes of the match and pressured Croatia's defense. From the 5th minute, Croatia regained possession and pushed into Albania's half. A corner kick was played short, and a free kick for Croatia was unsuccessful.\n\nThe stadium had never been louder. Especially when Croatia's defense slept and conceded a cheap goal for 0-1 Albania in the 12th minute.\n\nAlbania was running everything down their right side, likely taking advantage of Peri\u0161i\u0107's fitness. Croatia picked up the intensity in the next 10 minutes but alas, they failed to finish. Brozovi\u0107 had the first shot on target in the 20th minute.\n\nPetkovi\u0107 missed a chance over the goal in the 26th, and then a dangerous free kick was awarded to Albania the following minute. Another great chance for Albania finished over the goal.\n\nMdori\u0107 lost the ball in Croatia's half which almost resulted in another goal for Albania, but luckily Gvardiol was there to save the day.\n\nCroatia played possession from the 30th minute and was granted a foul on the left edge of the box, but no one was in front of the Albania keeper to knock it in.\n\nThe match was 1-0 for Albania at halftime.\n\nSucic and Pasalic were subbed on for Majer and Brozovic to start the second half. Let's hope this helps Croatia's game.\n\nJuranovic launched the ball into the box from the right but it ended in the keeper's hands.\n\nSucic had a shot on goal in the 50th minute and Croatia was definitely more active in Albania's half for the first 10 minutes.\n\nKova took a shot in the 53rd minute that went into the keeper's hands. Perisic launched a ball from the left to Pasalic's head that went out for a goal kick.\n\nAnother good chance for Croatia in the 56th minute went out for a corner, and Sutalo's near post header missed the goal.\n\nPerisic took his chances with a hot in the 60th minute which deflected off the Albania defender and went into the keeper's hands. Albania had not been dangerous in Croatia's half yet this half.\n\nAlbania was dangerous in the 66th minute going one-on-one with Gvardiol, but the shot went wide of the goal.\n\nPerisic launched another great ball from the left to the far post, but Pasalic's header missed the goal. Budimir was subbed on for Petkovic in the 68th minute.\n\nAnother corner was awarded for Croatia in the 70th minute, but it was cleared by the Albania defense.\n\nAnd then finally, right as we were beginning to lose hope - Kramaric saves the day to score for 1-1 in the 74th minute!\n\nPasalic missed a sitter in front of the keeper in the next minute, but another miracle for Croatia - an own goal in the 76th minute for 2-1 Croatiaaaaaaaa!\n\nOkay, okay - and the fans started screaming again. But another goal would be good to help our goal differential in Group B. Sosa was subbed on for Perisic and Baturina for Kramaric in the 85th minute.\n\nLuka shot from just outside the box in the 88th minute, but went wide of the goal. We were counting down the seconds to the final whistle.\n\nBaturina wowed with an incredible run up the left side in the 89th minute and shot at the keeper - but well done to the 21-year-old - what a way to arrive at your first Euros.\n\nFive minutes of stoppage time were added to the end of the match. All Croatia needed to do was hold onto their lead, but not even that was possible. Albania scored a last-minute goal for 2-2.\n\nCroatia plays Italy on Monday at 9 pm in the most decisive game of Group B. Can the Vatreni make magic happen again? The tournament no longer depends on them.", "source": {"uri": "total-croatia-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Croatia News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniela_rogulj@total-croatia-news.com",

If you look at the statistics we had more expected goals than them.\n\n\"Sometimes you win, but sometimes you don't take the goal chance.\"\n\nCroatia's situation puts them exactly where they have been at major tournaments in recent years - the underdogs.\n\nThat is what could serve them well as they look to keep alive their hopes of avoiding an early exit by beating Italy.\n\n\"We will believe until the very end,\" Kramaric added. \"We hope to be a bit luckier against Italy.\n\n\"Croatia can never do anything the easy way, we have proved this many times.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksparkstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volksparkstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvinho", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sylvinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Morrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinton Morrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/abb1dfec527b5cbdd8194c6760503e1d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

After suffering defeats in their opening fixtures, both nations go in search of their first points of the tournament.\n\nCroatia sit bottom of Group B, following a 3-0 thumping at the hands of Spain on Saturday. That ended a good run of form for the Croats, who were undefeated in six prior to that clash, but will expect to get back to winning ways here.\n\nAlbania could not have dreamt of a better start to their campaign, scoring the fastest goal in European Championship history just 23 seconds into their 2-1 defeat to Italy. After an impressive qualification campaign, the Albanians have now lost three of their last five internationals.\n\nLivakovic; J. Gvardiol, J Sutalo, M. Pongracic, J. Stanisic; L Modric, M. Kovacic, M. Brozovic; I Perisic, L Majer, A. Budimir.\n\nThe probable lineup for Albania in the 4-2-3-1\n\nT. Strakosha; M Mitaj, A Ajeti, B. Djimsiti, E Hysaj, K. Asllani; Y. Ramadani, T. Seferi, N. Bajrami, J. Asani; A. Broja.\n\nCroatia to get first points on the board\n\nAfter a damaging 3-0 defeat to Spain on Match Day 1, Croatia must bounce back with a win here. With a final group game against fellow top-10-ranked nation Italy, this fixture with Albania represents their easiest challenge on paper.\n\nThe three-goal loss to the Spanish was arguably not as convincing as it appeared. The Croatians had more possession, had more attempts at goal and outperformed the winners in the xG (expected goals) data.\n\nExpect Zlatko Dali\u0107's men to get the job done as they should when priced at around 1.50, but that is a price we are unable to suggest as a tip. However, add under 4.5 goals to the bet and the price is a much more palatable 1.72.\n\nAs often happens in tournament football when a strikeforce draws a blank, there is a debate whether there should be changes. Ante Budimir should have done enough across the season to warrant another start here.\n\nThe Osasuna frontman cracked a career-high 17 goals in the Spanish top flight this term and added one goal in his two Europa Conference League appearances. In the colours of Croatia, he scored against Portugal in the final warm-up match ahead of this tournament.\n\nThe 32-year-old scored the goal that clinched qualification in defeating Armenia 1-0. He may be seen as something of a good luck charm and will fancy his chances of scoring again against the second lowest-ranked side in the competition.\n\nNedim Bajrami's goal 23 seconds into the match against Italy may have grabbed headlines, but it was Albania's only shot on target throughout the whole match. This lack of offensive output is not unusual for them under the stewardship of former Arsenal and Barcelona defender, Sylvinho.\n\nPrior to the clash with the Italians, they had failed to score in three of their last five internationals. The most alarming came against the Faroe Islands in the last game of qualifying.\n\nCroatia generally offer a solid defensive unit, having kept a clean sheet in four of their last seven fixtures.",

Instead they produced the opposite, falling behind after 11 minutes when Qazim Laci ghosted in and glanced home a header that Croatia keeper Dominik Livakovic should have kept out.\n\nWhat followed was a soporific display of the art of passing for passing's sake. If passing teams to death was a successful strategy then Croatia would be football's most lethal executioners. But hogging the ball in the first half with over 60% possession got them nowhere.\n\nIt was a similar story in their opener when they had more possession than Spain - the first team to do so in 136 competitive matches since the Euro 2008 final - but ended up losing 3-0.\n\nLike a medieval army picking an elevated spot to engage in battle, Albania were happy to concede territory up the field in favour of packing the final third, safe in the knowledge that Croatia would not hurt them.\n\nThat strategy fell apart in the second half, however, after Croatia brought on substitutes Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic in the break and looked almost unrecognisable as they tore into their opponents.\n\nThey levelled when Andrej Kramaric shot through the legs of Elseid Hysaj into the bottom corner in the 73rd minute and took the lead when Albania's Klaus Gjasula saw the ball bounce off him into his own goal.\n\nThat should have been the cue for Croatia to twist the knife or at least shut up shop. Instead they seemed to slacken off and invite the Albanians back into the match.\n\nIt was deep in stoppage time when Albania drew level, with Gjasula drilling his finish hard and low into net to make up for his earlier own goal.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enver Hoxha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elseid_Hysaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elseid Hysaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albanians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=eba0b5e9-7bef-519c-a3ba-31906595a95f&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.80214&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.09269.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The 2-2 draw keeps both sides alive.\n\nConventional tournament wisdom says you cannot lose your first game and expect to advance except when there is a 24-team tournament. This means four teams have the chance to sneak through to the knockout phase as a best 3rd place team and in this group one win with goal difference might just be enough.\n\nAfter smashing the Euro record for scoring the fastest ever goal in the competition's history (23 seconds against Italy), Albania started with the same kind of intensity.\n\nModric majestic in second half\n\nThey pinned Croatia back in their defensive third of the field and that pressure paid off in the 10th minute. Jasir Asani lofted a beautiful cross from the right side onto the head of Qazim Laci who had ghosted into the box like the invisible man as the Croatian backline stood around and watched. Dominik Livakovic the Croatian goalkeeper will look back on his effort to keep the ball out and not be a happy man.\n\nYou had to wonder whether Zlatko Dalic's men were still shellshocked from the waxing inflicted on them by Spain or perhaps father time has finally caught up with this magnificent but aging team.\n\nCroatia though are dogged, and they have taken body blows from the best. Ivan Perisic is the epitome of that mentality and he looked to put his team on his back working tirelessly down the left-hand side trying to carve open opportunities.\n\nLuka Sucic gave Croatia the lead\n\nAs Croatia pushed forward though, Albania started looking increasingly dangerous on the counterattack.\n\nIn the 31st minute Luka Modric did the unthinkable and gave the ball away initiating a 4 on 3 break. Asani's pass deflected into the path of Kristjan Asllani who's blistering drive was brilliantly saved by Livakovic, who redeemed himself for his earlier faux pas.\n\nWhat was becoming increasingly clear is that Albania's defensive set up had been cleverly devised by their coach, Sylvinho. The Brazilian obviously had learned from Arsene Wenger during his illustrious Arsenal playing career.\n\nThey were compact, narrow and difficult to play through. Croatia started resorting to hopeful balls into the box, which was nothing but food and drink for the back four and goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha who was becoming more composed and assured by the minute.\n\nJust before the half, another counterattack and this time Roy Manaj drifting unnoticed into the area. His header though was weak and Livakovic easily collected but warning signs were there, and they were being ignored.\n\nWith a shrill blast of his whistle, referee Francois Letexier, signaled the end of the first half and we had the potential of another shock result as Albania ranked 66th by FIFA deservedly took a 1-0 lead into the dressing room against 10th ranked Croatia.\n\nZlatko Dalic made two changes to liven up his team sending on Mario Pasalic and Luka Sucic and the impact was immediate.\n\nKlaus Gjasula celebrates Albania's equaliser\n\nIn the 50th minute, Sucic worked Strakosha with a low strike that the Albanian keeper pushed away to his right. Then Pasalic found space, but his header was misdirected when it looked easier to hit the target. Three minutes later Mateo Kovacic took his turn to bring his country back into the game, but his deflected effort wasn't hit hard enough to wrongfoot Strakosha.\n\nNow it was time for Modric to step up and the maestro began to conduct the play with the majesty of his younger years.\n\nIf anyone can create tempo, it's the Croatian captain, and his probing passes started splitting that tight Albanian back four for the first time on a consistent basis. Wave after wave of Croatian attacks. Pressure, crosses, shots. Bend but don't break was the Albanian motto as Sylvinho was becoming increasingly animated in the coaching box.\n\nBreak they did though. In the 74th minute the constant, overwhelming pressure finally paid off. A smart interchange of passes released Andrej Kramaric, and once he cut inside and wrongfooted Strakosha the game was tied, and Croatia could take themselves off the life support system that was keeping them in the Euros.\n\nTwo minutes later they were more than breathing, they were celebrating as 2nd half substitute Ante Budmir bullied his way to the by-line pulling the ball back for Susic. His shot was blocked but the rebound cruelly hit Klaus Gjasula who hadn't been on the pitch for more than three minutes and bounced apologetically into the back of the goal. What a turnaround...and so unlucky for Albania.\n\nIn football if you have belief there is always time for one more chance and in the 89th minute, Albania had theirs after a storming run by Arber Hoxha who alluded what seemed like the entire Croatian back line and firing in a line drive that Livakovic did well to parry. The follow up was smashed over the bar and Livakovic took a boot to the face for his pains.\n\nYou just had to admire Albania though, because there is no quit in them.\n\nWith just one minute remaining they somehow summoned the desire and produced a brilliant team goal, expertly finished by Gjasula. Cue delirium from Sylvinho and his substitutes, coaching staff and anyone close enough to hug.\n\nStill both teams weren't finished and in a madcap three minutes both had opportunities to win it. With the final whistle the only thought was to let them keep playing. Change the rules. Last goal wins.\n\nUltimately, a point a piece was probably fair. Albania took the first half, Croatia the second, but Albania's incredible spirit kept them alive for now. With Spain up next, they'll need a proper miracle as will Croatia as they take on Italy. Yet another breathtaking game at these Euros that keep on giving.\n\nContact the writer, Nick Webster, at moc.l1718819287labto1718819287ofdlr1718819287owedi1718819287sni@o1718819287fni1718819287",

You could see the euphoria in the stadium.\"\n\nHungary's hopes of progressing to the last 16 now hang by a thread, while group rivals Switzerland and Scotland meet in Wednesday's late match in Cologne.\n\nSwitzerland, quarter-finalists at Euro 2020, will be through to the last 16 with a win in that game.\n\nScotland are aiming to win a match at a major tournament for the first time since beating the Swiss 1-0 at Euro 96.\n\nGjasula saves Albania\n\nElsewhere on Wednesday, Albania's Klaus Gjasula scored at both ends, including a dramatic injury-time equaliser as his side drew 2-2 with Croatia in Hamburg.\n\nAfter a disappointing 3-0 loss to Spain in their opening game in Group B, Croatia were behind again when Qazim Laci gave Albania an early lead.\n\nBut Croatia improved after the break and Andrej Kramaric levelled with 16 minutes remaining, before Gjasula put through his own net.\n\nThe Albania midfielder became the last-gasp hero, though, slotting into the bottom corner in the fifth minute of injury time to snatch his team a point.\n\nCroatia, World Cup semi-finalists in 2022, will now likely need to win their final Group B match against holders Italy on June 24 to reach the knockout phase for a fifth straight major tournament.\n\n\"We will believe until the very end, to give our best as we did in this match,\" said forward Kramaric.\n\n\"Unfortunately we didn't win but we hope to be a bit luckier against Italy.\"\n\nAlbania have won plenty of plaudits with their performances against both Italy, in a 2-1 defeat, and Croatia, but could not hold a lead in either game and will probably have to beat Spain to keep their last-16 hopes alive.\n\n\"We have to go forward but we have to fight for every single point,\" said Albania's Brazilian coach, Sylvinho.\n\n\"It's important for our lives, the life of the country, the federation. I'm proud of the players so we have to enjoy the moment.\"\n\nGroup rivals Spain and Italy meet in Gelsenkirchen in the standout tie on Thursday, while England face Denmark and Slovenia take on Serbia

She was mobbed by fans and snapped by grinning Qatari supporters in the stands - who it was later claimed disapproved of her revealing red and white outfits and needed the photos \"probably to report them\". We believe you lads.\n\nThe bombshell announced earlier this month that she would be heading to Germany, during an interview when she confirmed she is in fact 26-years-old, not 31 as had been previously widely reported. But her presence didn't seem to help Croatia during their 3-0 defeat to Spain last weekend and things didn't go much better when she showed up in Hamburg today.\n\nREAD MORE: World Cup's sexiest fan hints at Euro 2024 appearance in bikini snaps after wowing in Qatar\n\nREAD MORE: World Cup's sexiest fan is now a hot DJ and leaves jaws on floor in leotard and boots\n\nDonning a plunging white and red top, with a blue denim jacket and skin tight red leggings, Ivana looked as radiant as ever. Yet she wasn't able to inspire Croatia to victory, and while some fans on her Instagram page seemed as besotted with her as they were two years ago, others claimed she had brought \"bad luck\" and bizarrely that her arresting attire might in fact have proved \"distracting\" for the players.\n\nWhether or not Croatia's struggles on the pitch can be attributed to their players having their attention drawn to Ivana in the stands - for the record, it's safe to say they can't - it's clear the current vintage don't look as impressive as the side that finished runners-up in the World Cup in 2018 and achieved an impressive third place in 2022.\n\nDo you think Ivana Knoll can inspire Croatia to repeat their World Cup heroics?

Klaus Gjasula struck five minutes into stoppage time to rescue a 2-2 draw for his Albania.\n\nCroatia looked to have secured a fine comeback win after Andrej Kramaric scored in the 74th minute to cancel out Qazim Laci's early goal for Albania, then midfielder Gjasula inadvertently turned the ball past his own goalkeeper two minutes later.\n\nBut with time almost up, Albania attacked down the left and the ball was crossed to Gjasula, who fired left footed into the corner to stun Croatia and set up a tense finale to Group B.\n\nAlbania took the lead after 10 minutes. Jasir Asani collected the ball wide on the right midway inside the Croatia half and launched a reaching cross that was met with a glancing header by Laci, his effort squeezing through the hands of goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic and in at the near post.\n\nThe advantage was nearly doubled on the half-hour mark when Kristjan Asllani went through but was denied by a superb low stop from Livakovic, then on the stroke of half-time the goalkeeper was again called upon to keep out Rey Manaj's close-range header.\n\nCroatia began the second half with renewed urgency and should have levelled after 57 minutes when defender Josip Sutalo headed a near-post corner wide from two yards.\n\nThe equaliser finally arrived from Kramaric, the striker finding himself in space inside the penalty area from Ante Budimir's pass and striking the ball through the legs of Elseid Hysaj. And minutes later they led, Budimir's cutback was hit low at goal by Luka Sucic, his blocked effort rebounding into the net off the unfortunate Gjasula.\n\nThen when all looked lost, Gjasula redeemed himself in dramatic fashion, left free near the penalty spot to sweep the ball into the corner to save Albania.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"},

And thus, a cagey opening ensued on Wednesday.\n\nContent to slow the tempo, Albania soon became comfortable in possession. And then, almost out of nowhere, Qazim Lac\u0327i broke free at the near post to glance at Jasir Asani's pinpoint delivery from the right. Another quick-opening goal for Sylvinho's men.\n\nCroatia were momentarily shaken, and the Eagles saw their opportunity to go again. This time, Nedim Bajrami darted into the danger zone, but to the relief of Zlatko Dali\u0107, failed to test Dominik Livakovic\u0301.\n\nNow pressing higher up the pitch, Croatia engineered their first real threat as Marcelo Brozovic's anxious snap-shot flew well wide. Unfazed, Albania continued to push for a second, and in the 31st minute Livakovic\u0301 was forced to deny Kristjan Asllani.\n\nDespite sitting deep to protect their advantage, Albania breached the Brozovic-protected Vatreni back line once more before half-time; however, Livakovic\u0301 dealt with Rey Manaj's close-range header.\n\nWith the interval introduction of Mario Pasalic\u0301 and Luka Succic, Croatia produced two decent chances. Thomas Strakosha got a strong hand to Succic\u0301's powerful shot before Pasalic fired over.\n\nDalic's team were now enjoying their best spell of the game, and as Albania's energy levels waned, Croatia's threat increased.\n\nThe Vatreni were probing for a chink in the Albanian armour, and eventually, in the 74th minute, their breakthrough came. As Albania switched off, Andrej Kramaric found the bottom corner to restore parity - his first EURO goal on his 33rd birthday. Two minutes later, Croatia struck again, Klaus Gjasula deflecting into his own net amid a goalmouth scramble.\n\nStill turning the screw until the full-time whistle, Croatia's tremendous second-half performance looked to have secured them all three points. However, in a dramatic twist, Gjasula - who only came on in the 72nd minute - found redemption by driving in a low last-gasp leveller. Both sides duly claimed their first points of EURO 2024.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Livakovi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Livakovi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazim_La\u00e7i", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qazim La\u00e7i"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Asllani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristjan Asllani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasir_Asani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasir Asani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nedim_Bajrami", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nedim Bajrami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatko_Dali\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zlatko Dali\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Croatia national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_Manaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rey Manaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Strakosha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Strakosha"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 7}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=Euro+2024%3A+Gjasula+redeems+himself+with+late+equaliser+as+Albania+hold+Croatia+2-2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 26}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

It may have lacked the drama of the game that came before it but that will suit Julian Nagelsmann to a tee, his side coming through an altogether greater test than they had against Scotland.\n\nGermany's win came after perhaps the stand-out game of Euro 2024 so far, Croatia recovering after conceding early to lead Albania 2-1 only to be pegged back late on. Qazim Laci looked to have given Sylvinho's Kuqezinjt\u00eb a narrow win at Volksparkstadion in Hamburg before a late two-minute blitz from Andrej Kramaric and then a Klaus Gajsula own goal turned things Vatreni's way. However, there was still time for drama as Gjasula equalized for Albania deep into injury time and received a late booking in a big Group B result.\n\nScotland vs. Switzerland is still to come this Wednesday, here's everything you need to know so far from day six in Germany.\n\nEuro 2024 scores for WednesdayCroatia 2, Albania 2Germany 2, Hungary 0Scotland vs. Switzerland at 3 p.m. ET (preview)Germany 2, Hungary 0: Hosts wobble but reach last 16\n\nIt was hardly the first half shellacking that they meted out on Scotland in the Euro 2024 opener but Germany got the job done, a Jamal Musiala goal enough to take them through to the knockout stages. It might have gone rather differently on another day, from the outset Hungary were testing the German defense. Indeed the first half was bookended by the threat of Roland Sallai, who might have found the net in the opening exchanges and did just before the break, semi-automated offside technology confirming the Freiburg forward had just drifted offside.\n\nBetween those two openings came Germany's goal, Ilkay Gundogan pouncing on a mess in the box that Willi Orban ought to have dealt with and then teeing up Musiala to strike. The Bayern Munich playmaker might have had another, a fierce shot ricocheting off the side netting, but the hosts also had Manuel Neuer to thank for a bouncy save off a Dominik Szoboszlai free kick. From a tight angle, Bendeguz Bolla couldn't quite turn in the rebound.\n\nGermany's struggles didn't ease in a second half when Barnabas Varga drifted away from Jonathan Tah to flick a cross over the bar, a chance from which he ought to have tested Neuer. Their profligacy was punished in the 67th minute, Maximilian Mittelstadt delivering a fine low cross for Gundogan to turn in. Leroy Sane's added spark off the bench nearly brought a third for Germany, who will be assured of a top-two finish if Switzerland avoid defeat later on Wednesday. Even if they were to finish third they would be guaranteed a place in the last 16.\n\nThey will be hoping for much more than just that, however. Not since 1984 has a host nation lifted the Henri Delaunay Trophy. With seven goals to their name through two games, Germany must surely figure among the contenders to do exactly that.\n\nCroatia 2, Albania 2: Gjasula goes from villain to hero\n\nCroatia have become synonymous over the years for their dramatic and occasionally fortunate ways of avoiding defeat at international tournaments. Vatreni regularly rely on extra time and penalties when on deep runs such as their FIFA 2018 World Cup final journey in Russia. Obviously, there are no games going beyond the regulation 90 minutes plus extra time in the group stage of UEFA Euro 2024, yet Zlatko Dalic's men found a way to play with fire regardless.\n\nQazim Laci was allowed to head home after just 11 minutes in Hamburg and until the final quarter of an hour, it looked as if it might be enough for Sylvinho's side who were unlucky to lose out narrowly to Italy in their opening game. Cue Andrej Kramaric with an turn and finish equalizer on 74 minutes before a Klaus Gjasula own goal two minutes late for the full Croatia international tournament experience condensed into a matter of 120 seconds or so. Unlike in previous years, though, there was a late twist in favor of Kuqezinjt\u00eb as Gjasula found himself on hand to turn home five minutes into added time before picking up a trademark booking.\n\nThe result means that Croatia are now up against it to advance with a draw between Italy and Spain on Thursday possibly already putting a top-two finish out of reach for both Dalic's side and Albania. Only a win over the Azzurri could see this Croatia side advance and even that might require being one of the best third-placed sides while the winner between the Italians and La Roja could reach the round of 16 with a game to spare.\n\nIt seems to be one tournament too far for this golden generation of Croatian talent with Luka Modric suddenly looking every bit his 38 years of age and former stalwarts Ivan Perisic and Marcelo Brozovic also declining forces. It did look as if their black magic touch had not entirely deserted them, but Gjasula's late equalizer appeared to not only deny Croatia the win but also break their mental resolve at the end of another thrilling game of soccer at this Euro.\n\nGroup B state of playTEAMMPWDLGFGAPTSSpain\n\n1\n\n0\n\n03Italy\n\n1\n\n0\n\n13Albania\n\n1\n\n41Croatia\n\n1\n\n51\n\nThe winner of Italy vs. Spain on Thursday could be assured of a knockout round place after just two games played while any potential loser in that one would be the team to catch for Croatia and Albania. A draw in the Azzurri clash with La Roja is actually the most likely result to see both through as they will be three points clear ahead of the final games, but the task is tough for Croatia against Italy and Albania against Spain. Should one of the two be able to pull off an unexpected win in the third and final game then advancing as one of the best third-placed sides could still be on the cards but another draw is unlikely to suffice.\n\nGroup A state of playTEAMMPWDLGFGAPTS\n\nGermany\n\n2\n\n0\n\n7\n\n16\n\nSwitzerland\n\n1\n\n0\n\n13\n\nHungary\n\n0\n\n50\n\nScotland\n\n0\n\n1\n\n50\n\nGermany are through, that much is certain, while Scotland will surely have been toasting their success as they ready themselves for their meeting with Switzerland later on Wednesday. Any points that Steve Clarke's side can pick up would put them in the driving seat for what is shaping up to be a battle for third place with the Magyars in Sunday's final round of games. Of course, all that could change if they beat the Swiss, who know they will guarantee their qualification with a win. Hungary will have to win their final game if they are to have any chance of qualifying. Having lost to the top two, the best they can now hope for is a third-place finish.\n\nWhat happened on TuesdayTurkiye 3, Georgia 1Portugal 2, Czechia 1\n\nDay 5 was a thoroughly entertaining round of games despite there only being two Group F fixtures with wins for both Turkiye and Portugal to open their campaigns. A pulsating four-goal encounter at Signal Iduna Park saw Turkiye come out on top of a game which Georgia could have quite easily drawn before going on to lose out by a two-goal margin with Mert Muldur and Arda Guler scoring goal of the Euro contenders. Elsewhere, Czechia threatened an upset when Lukas Provod opened the scoring before a late Francisco Conceicao winner after a Robin Hranac own goal and a marginal Diogo Jota offside. Turkiye and Portugal meet next so Georgia and Czechia's game before that is of even more significant importance.\n\nThursday's schedule\n\nAll times Eastern\n\nSlovenia vs. Serbia, 9 a.m. Denmark vs.

With just one point from two games, only victory in that one will be enough to reach the knockout stages. Albania could even get through if they can shock Spain.\n\nCroatia roared into life in the second half after Qazim Laci's glancing header put Albania ahead after only 11 minutes. They even squandered a few chances to extend that lead before the break.\n\nBy that stage, Modric had struggled to get control of the game, despite racking up impressive passing statistics. Manchester City's Mateo Kovacic had been a little brighter during a brief spell of pressure, but again not involved enough to warrant any more for his side.\n\nBoth Champions League-winning midfielders made a better start to the second half as Croatia finally registered a shot on target from Luka Sucic. Kovacic then saw the sting taken out of his shot by a deflection, with Modric delivering a corner that centre-back Josip Sutalo somehow headed wide.\n\nIt was Kovacic whose attempt to break the Albanian lines created the space Croatia needed to get back level, feeding Ante Budimir, who in turn slid in former Leicester City striker Andrej Kramaric for the finish.\n\nCity's Josko Gvardiol had already been increasingly stepping into midfield with the ball for Croatia and that helped made the quick-fire second possible with a pass in the build-up, although it still relied on Budimir keeping the attack alive and a huge slice of fortune when Sucic's shot was initially blocked but then bounced into the net off Gjasula.\n\nA late Albanian onslaught looked like it would peter out until Gjasula converted a cutback from the left with a first-time effort near the penalty spot.\n\nCroatia finished third at the World Cup less than two years ago, having also been to the final in 2018, but their European Championship record is sketchy by comparison to those global displays. Since the Euros expanded into a 24-team format, Croatia haven't gone beyond the last 16, while they failed to get out of the group stage at all in both 2004 and 2012.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo\u0161ko_Gvardiol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Budimir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ante Budimir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Men's_Handball_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Men's Handball Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2553,h_1436,x_794,y_1374/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j0rje58wmxftahna1t.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

With a game to play, they still have a chance of progression.\n\nManaged by former Arsenal, Barcelona and Brazil full-back Sylvinho, Albania are a physical counter-attacking side that look to make up any perceived talent gap between themselves and their opponents through hard running. It took 23 seconds for this side to make a mark at Euro 2024 as Nedim Bajrami set a new record for the fastest goal scored in European Championship history when opening the scoring against Italy. While Albania eventually lost that match 2-1, their early goal served as a warning; underestimate this team at your peril.\n\nIt was a warning that Croatia struggled to heed. Wednesday's encounter between the two sides was an unexpected and entertaining romp. It again saw Albania go ahead early - Qazim Laci nodding in a superb cross from Jasir Asani in the 11th minute - before stubbornly battling to protect their lead. At half-time, Croatia had registered 69 per cent possession, but Albania had the game's better chances.\n\nKristjan Asllani went off-target following a quick attacking move sparked by Luka Modric losing the ball. Albanian striker Rey Manaj also looked forlorn after failing to get a proper connection on a header. This has been a running theme for Sylvinho's side, who have lacked attacking fluency at points throughout his 18-month spell in charge.\n\nInjuries to Manaj and Armando Broja throughout the qualifying games meant neither striker built the sort of playing chemistry a team needs to be a potent counter-attacking side. The manager's decision to leave regulars Myrto Uzuni, Keidi Bare and Sokol Cikalleshi out of the 26-man squad for the tournament also caused a stir. Cikalleshi - a striker for Turkish club Konyaspor - was not the most prolific goalscorer, but his hold-up play gave Albania a valuable foothold in qualifying matches.\n\nYet this side finds a way to forge its own path through the tournament; one that frequently sees it roughing up bigger and more established football players. Mario Mandzukic - now an assistant coach with Croatia - could be seen leaping from the dugout to demand his players match Albania's intensity in the first half.\n\nIt took a handful of second-half changes for Croatia to swing the game's momentum in their favour. Marcelo Brozovic and Lovro Majer were replaced by Mario Pasalic and Luka Sucic at half-time. Twenty minutes later, striker Ante Budimir was introduced to give his team a better target for their crosses. Croatia grew in confidence. Their full-backs crept further and further up the field while the build-up patterns of Modric and Mateo Kovacic became more dangerous. Budimir teed up Andrej Kramaric for their equaliser in the 74th minute. Two minutes later, the duo teamed up for another. A cross intended for Luka Sucic pinballed in the penalty area before being turned in by Albania's defensive midfielder Klaus Gjasula.\n\nAlbania could have collapsed, but they somehow found a second wind. In Asllani, they have a midfielder who is composed when in possession, and nicely combative when out of it. The 22-year-old is fast emerging as Brozovic's eventual successor for the defensive midfield role at Inter Milan and was the heartbeat of his side.\n\n\"We have to fight for every point,\" was Sylvinho's post-match assessment of the game. \"For our country and for our federation.\"\n\nThe Brazilian often makes mention of sweat and respect in press conferences. Hard work is the bare minimum and the most important ingredient for this Albania side. They can be iffy in front of goal (Mirlind Daku was booked late in stoppage time when an attempted volley missed the ball and hit Josko Gvardiol in the side of the head), but what is most important to the manager, and the thousands of fans who travelled to Hamburg on Wednesday, is their ability to keep trying. That hard work eventually paid off deep in stoppage time, when Mitaj pulled back a wonderful low cross for Gjasula.\n\nThe time read 94 minutes and 23 seconds when Albania got their equaliser (the latest goal to be scored at a Euros outside of extra time). It was an equalising goal that felt like a last-minute winner. The noise in the Volksparkstadion was deafening. Gjasula - only the second player to score an own goal and a goal within the same game at the Euros - had given his side a slender chance of making it to the round of 16.\n\n\"This is Albania; it's a bit crazy,\" said Asllani after the 2-2 draw.\n\n\"We started off on the right foot, and then I can say I missed a big chance, but I thought Modric would get on the ball before me. I think we conceded two avoidable goals. We'll review them, surely. The game was crazy in the last 15 minutes.\"\n\nSylvinho's scrappers will need to be at their very best to get a result against Spain in their final group game, but they are a team that has never been afraid of hard work. Albania doesn't quit, and that makes them a difficult opponent at this tournament.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I'm proud of the players so we have to enjoy the moment.\"\n\nIt took until only the 11th minute for Sylvinho's men to break the deadlock this time, as Sparta Prague midfielder Laci ghosted into the area unmarked to nod home an inch-perfect, inswinging cross from Jasir Asani.\n\nCroatia tried to impose their passing game, but Albania were constantly in their faces and continued to look the more dangerous side, with right-back Elseid Hysaj firing off target.\n\nThe underdogs could have doubled their advantage just after the half-hour mark, but Kristjan Asllani was denied by Dominik Livakovic when face-to-face with the Croatia goalkeeper.\n\nAlbania striker Rey Manaj passed up another excellent opportunity, failing to get enough purchase on his free header in first-half added time to seriously trouble Livakovic.\n\nDalic responded by making two changes at the interval, bringing on 21-year-old Luka Sucic and Mario Pasalic for the ineffective Lovro Majer and Brozovic.\n\nThose substitutions brought about a quick improvement from Croatia, as Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha made a good save to keep out Sucic's left-footed shot, before Pasalic headed over seconds later.\n\nCroatia finally found a way through in the 74th minute as substitute Ante Budimir picked out Kramaric inside the box and he cut inside before sending a composed finish inside Strakosha's near post.\n\nThe turnaround appeared to be complete two minutes later as Sucic's close-range effort was blocked, but rebounded off the unfortunate Gjasula and into an empty net.\n\nAlbania did not give up, missing a series of late chances as it appeared Croatia would cling on.\n\nGjasula had other ideas though, sweeping a loose ball home before a chaotic denouement that saw both sides throw bodies forward in search of a winner, to no avail.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Gjasula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Gjasula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Sparta_Prague", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AC Sparta Prague"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristjan_Asllani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristjan Asllani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasir_Asani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasir Asani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elseid_Hysaj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elseid Hysaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_Manaj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rey Manaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovro_Majer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lovro Majer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Budimir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ante Budimir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Strakosha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Strakosha"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Bodypainting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quick_and_Easy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quick and Easy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Spain are eighth, and will be hoping to add a fourth European crown, which would make them the most-successful nation in the competition's history.

So, will Croatia be able to make their mark alongside two European powerhouses?\n\nCroatia have faced Spain 10 times in total including at Euro 2021, with La Roja winning 5-3 after extra-time.

Published: Wed 19 Jun 2024, 4:53 PM Last updated: Wed 19 Jun 2024, 5:10 PM\n\nBy PA Sport Staff\n\nKlaus Gjasula struck five minutes into stoppage time to rescue a 2-2 draw for Albania against Croatia in Hamburg and keep alive their hopes of reaching the Euro 2024 knockout stages.\n\nThe 2022 World Cup semi-finalists looked to have secured a fine comeback win after Andrej Kramaric scored in the 74th minute to cancel out Qazim Laci's early goal for Albania, then midfielder Gjasula inadvertently turned the ball past his own goalkeeper two minutes later.\n\nBut with time almost up, Albania attacked down the left and the ball was crossed to Gjasula who fired left footed into the corner to stun Croatia and set up a tense finale for Group B.\n\nAlbania took the lead after 10 minutes.\n\nJasir Asani collected the ball wide on the right midway inside the Croatia half and launched a reaching cross that was met with a glancing header by Laci, his effort squeezing through the hands of goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic and in at the near post.\n\nThe advantage was nearly doubled on the half-hour mark when Kristjan Asllani went through but was denied by a superb low stop from Livakovic, then on the stroke of half-time the goalkeeper was again called upon to keep out Rey Manaj's close-range header.\n\nCroatia began the second half with renewed urgency and should have levelled after 57 minutes when defender Josip Sutalo headed a near-post corner wide from two yards.\n\nThe equaliser finally arrived from Kramaric, the striker finding himself in space inside the penalty area from Ante Budimir's pass and striking the ball through the legs of Elseid Hysaj.\n\nAnd minutes later they led, Budimir's cutback was hit low at goal by Luka Sucic, his blocked effort rebounding into the net off the unfortunate Gjasula.\n\nThen, when all looked lost, Gjasula redeemed himself in dramatic fashion, left free near the penalty spot to sweep the ball into the corner to save Albania.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 19 Jun 2024, 4:53 PM Last updated: Wed 19 Jun 2024, 5:10 PM", "source": {"uri": "westmeathindependent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

comeback", "body": "Paddy Power Euro 2024 Sign Up Offer - Get \u00a3100 Scotland v Switzerland Free Bets\n\nAlbania struck an injury-time goal to snatch a draw from a pulsating Group B clash against Croatia.\n\nTwo late goals in as many minutes looked like they would be enough for Croatia to avoid one of the biggest upsets in European Championship history as they came from behind to lead 2-1 with 14 minutes remaining.\n\nJust as they did in their opening defeat against Italy, Albania took the lead in the Group B clash in Hamburg through Qasim Laci's early header.\n\nA dynamic and disciplined display saw them hold that advantage until 16 minutes from time when Andrej Kramaric swept home the equaliser on his 33rd brthday before an unfortunate goal from Klaus Gjasula turned the game ahead.\n\nHowever five minutes into added time Albania piled forward and Gjasula swept home the latest equaliser in European Championship history to spark wild celebrations.\n\nIt means Albania will need a win against Spain to stand any chance of progressing to the Round of 16 in their final game, while Croatia can only progress by beating Italy.\n\nMidfielder Laci was handed a start in midfield by coach Sylvinho and repaid his faith as he broke the deadlock on 11 minutes when he timed his run perfectly through a static Croatia defence to glance a header from a perfect cross from Jasir Asani under the grasp of keeper Dominik Livakovic, who might have done better.\n\nMarcelo Brozovic dragged an effort wide from the edge of he area on 20 minutes as Croatia found their feet and Lovro Majer's curling cross was headed over by Bruno Petkovic.\n\nAt the other end Elseid Hysaj lashed a bouncing ball over the Croatian bar on the half hour before Livakovic made a crucial save to deny Kristjan Asllani after he latched onto a through-ball from Asani which was deflected into his path with the goal at his mercy.\n\nThomas Strakosha gathered a long-range shot from Brozovic and Majer nodded wide of the upright as Croatia sought to turn the tide but Albania's energy made the veteran pairing of Modric and Mateo Kovacic look sluggish, clearly having learned their lesson having sat back when ahead against Italy in their opening game on Saturday.\n\nAlbania kept pressing and Manaj almost doubled the lead when his downward header was stopped by Livakovic in first-half stoppage-time.\n\nHalf-time changes pay dividends\n\nCroatia coach Zlatko Dalic withdrew Majer and Brozovic in favour of Luca Sucic and Mario Pasalic at the interval and Croatia were immediately on the front foot.\n\nSucic saw a curling left-footed parried away by Strakosha's strong hand - their first shot on target - and Pasalic missed the target within five minutes of he restart while Kovacic saw a 25-yard drive deflected into the arms of the keeper.\n\nA Sucic cross was headed over by Petkovic while Luka Modric's curling corner to the near post was somehow headed wide by Josip Sutalo from two yards out.\n\nIvan Perisic saw a deflected strike claimed by Strakosha before Albania launched their first attack of the half with Asllani working room to fire in a 25-yard effort which was dealt with by Livakovic.\n\nNedim Bajrami lashed wide of the angle of post and bar on 68 minutes after being held up well by Josko Gvardiol but it was mainly one-way traffic.\n\nThe Albanian resistance was finally broken on 74 minutes when the ball was worked into Kramaric who turned and pulled a low shot through the legs of defender Hysaj and inside the near post past the unsighted keeper.\n\nA superb hand by Strakosha prevented an immediate second as he slid out to thwart sub Ante Budimir but within two minutes Croatia were ahead when Budamir bustled to the byline and squared to Luka Sucic who saw his shot blocked by skipper Berat Djimsiti, only for the ball to cannon into the net off the knee of back-tracking midfielder Gjasula.\n\nLate drama\n\nCroatia saw to put the game on ice and Modric fizzed a low effort past the post but Livakovic had to get down well in the dying seconds to keep ALbania at bay while sub Mirlind Daku saw a shot blocked and hooked the rebound over.\n\nThe frantic finale came to a crescendo when Gjasula burst into the box leaving his marker in his wake to side-foot home a low pull-back from the left byline to stun the World Cup 2018 runners-up.\n\nThere was still time for Kovacic to test Strakosha from distance before the final whistle ensured a point apiece which really helps neither side's hopes of progressing.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com",

He's such a complete player and such a nice guy as well. Very humble. And if he keeps doing his thing, the way he's doing right now, he can be one of the best.\"\n\nMusiala opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a goal that was furiously protested by Hungary.\n\nG\u00fcndo\u011fan had set that up and got on the scoresheet himself in the second half.\n\nMusiala had netted Germany's second goal in the 5-1 opening victory over Scotland on Friday to kick off Euro 2024. Hungary lost 3-1 to Switzerland on Saturday and now faces an uphill challenge to advance.\n\n\"He did brilliant in both games,\" Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said. \"Not only the two goals, I think every situation or offensive proposition is pretty tough for the opponent to defend.\n\n\"I think it's important for him not to deal with the pressure, just to deal with his capability to solve any offensive one-on-one situations ... He should not think about the pressure, because he's brilliant in just playing soccer.\"\n\nHungary plays Scotland in the final Group A match on Sunday, when Nagelsmann's team takes on Switzerland.\n\nHungary was unbeaten in its previous three matches against Germany and it put up a good fight against the host nation in Stuttgart.\n\nCoach Marco Rossi said his players paid the price for what he felt was unbalanced refereeing.\n\n\"Throughout my career, first as player and then as coach, I have never looked for alibis,\" Rossi said. \"But what the referee did tonight ... I think even the Germans saw that he used two different measurements.\"Germany would have still won, it's stronger and it would have won, but the referee was the worst on the field.\"\n\nRossi's side started aggressively and stunned Germany by almost taking the lead inside 20 seconds.\n\nGoalkeeper Manuel Neuer had to be quick off his line to slide to the ball to stop Roland Sallai.\n\nThe noise level ramped up every time Musiala had the ball and the Stuttgart-born forward opened the scoring in chaotic fashion.\n\nMusiala tried to set up G\u00fcndo\u011fan but Hungary defender Willi Orb\u00e1n got to the ball first. However, he stumbled -- following what Hungary protested was a shove by G\u00fcndo\u011fan -- and as shotstopper P\u00e9ter Gul\u00e1csi tried to help him, G\u00fcndo\u011fan poked it on to Musiala, who smashed it into the net with the goalkeeper still on the ground.\n\n\"I was quite surprised that the Hungarian player and his teammates were angry about it,\" G\u00fcndo\u011fan said. \"I played in the Premier League for seven years and if you gave that in the Premier League as a foul I think everyone would have been laughing on the floor.\"\n\nHungary almost leveled immediately but Neuer did brilliantly to parry Dominik Szoboszlai's free kick and then keep out a follow-up with his foot. The crowd celebrated the save almost as loudly as it had done the goal.\n\nThe loud home fans thought Musiala had doubled his tally at the end of the half but his shot was deflected, hitting the side netting and making it ripple so that even Nagelsmann appeared to think it had gone in.\n\nGermany was seemingly in control in the second half and did get a second in the 68th minute when Maximilian Mittelst\u00e4dt rolled the ball across from the left and G\u00fcndo\u011fan drove it into the bottom right corner.\n\nAlbania substitute Klaus Gjasula had the rare experience of scoring for both teams Wednesday in an intense 2-2 draw with Croatia in Hamburg, Germany, that could make it difficult for each to survive the group stage at Euro 2024.\n\nThe Croatian players were particularly disappointed with the result in Hamburg after Gjasula's stoppage-time goal denied them a much-needed win after they lost 3-0 to Spain in their opening Group B match.\n\n\"My first minutes on the pitch were very, very difficult for me not only for the own goal but also other situations,\" Gjasula said. \"Then God wanted and gave me the opportunity to score. A very beautiful, historic day for me.\"\n\nIn the first-ever competitive match between the two Balkan teams, Croatia tried to set the pace from the start, but it was Albania's Qazim Laci who scored first, heading in a cross from the right flank in the 11th minute.\n\nAndrej Kramaric equalized in the 74th minute before Gjasula's own goal made it 2-1 for Croatia just two minutes later.\n\nAt that point, Croatia looked in control but a late surge by Albania changed everything once again as Gjasula redeemed himself by scoring with a low shot in the 95th minute.\n\nIt was a thrilling end-to-match that leaves both Croatia and Albania in a precarious situation in the group. Albania lost to defending champion Italy 2-1 in its first match.\n\nThe third-place Albanians, who are ahead of Croatia on goal difference, celebrated the most after the match, while Luka Modric and his teammates -- semifinalists at the 2022 World Cup -- looked disappointed as they applauded the Croatian fans.\n\n\"We would have been a lot happier if we hadn't conceded the last goal. The situation would have been totally different,\" Kramaric said. \"We turned the match, and we should have won. But that's football.\"\n\nThe Volksparkstadion in Hamburg was split evenly between red-clad Albania fans and spectators in Croatia's checkered shirt providing a loud and energetic atmosphere.\n\nFans in Croatia's section set off flares repeatedly, despite warnings over the loudspeakers that it would result in disciplinary action.\n\nCroatia struggled to create chances in the first half and could have faced a greater deficit but goalkeeper\n\nDominik Livakovic blocked a shot from Kristjan Asllani and a header from Rey Manaj to keep it 1-0 at halftime.\n\nThe Croatians came out with more energy after the break and turned the match around in two minutes.\n\nKramaric equalized with a shot just inside the post. And just moments later Gjasula was unlucky when Albania tried to clear the ball from the penalty area but it bounced off him and into the net for the fourth own goal of the tournament.\n\nAlbania coach Sylvinho said he was proud of his team's performance. Albania is playing only its second European Championship and was considered unlikely to advance out of the group.\n\n\"It was amazing. I will remember this game all my life,\" he said.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri's stunning first-half strike secured a 1-1 draw for Switzerland against Scotland at Euro 2024 on Wednesday in Cologne, Germany.\n\nThe 32-year-old Chicago Fire forward rolled back the years with a first-time curling effort from about 20 meters out at Cologne Stadium.\n\nScotland had led from the 13th minute when Scott McTominay's shot took a wicked deflection off Fabian Schar to beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer.\n\nBut Shaqiri pounced on Anthony Ralston's loose pass in the 26th to even the match.\n\nThe draw leaves Switzerland second in Group B on four points and likely to advance to the round of 16, while Scotland's hopes of making the knockout round depend on its final game against Hungary on Sunday and results elsewhere.\n\nBoth teams had chances to win the game.\n\nThe Swiss should have taken the lead just before the hour mark when Dan Ndoye turned Kieran Tierney on the edge of the box. With just goalkeeper Angus Gunn to beat, Ndoye fired wide of goal.\n\nGrant Hanley then headed against the post from a Scotland free kick and Switzerland's Zeki Amdouni headed wide at the far post late on.\n\nScotland has never advanced beyond the group stage of a World Cup or Euros on 11 previous attempts.\n\nBut repeated disappointment doesn't seem to dampen optimism among its fans, who filled Cologne's square before the game.\n\nSwiss fans were out in numbers, too, creating a raucous atmosphere in the stadium.\n\nThe Scots were the first ones cheering when Schar stuck out a boot to try to block McTominay's effort, but diverted it into his own net.\n\nThe lead didn't last long as Ralston was guilty of a wayward pass at the back. Even then, it took a moment of brilliance from Shaqiri to sweep a left-footed shot into the top corner and past Gunn.\n\nIt was the sixth straight major international tournament in which Shaqiri has

for this game.\n\nThat didn't deter the 22-year-old from stepping out from the back with the ball at his feet, confidently getting numerous attacks under way and completing a total of 60 passes.\n\nHe

cover a lot of ground out of possession.\n\nHis 89 successful passes was the second highest in the game behind Modric, while he completed more tackles than anyone else (four) and had a joint game-high three shots.\n\nOur man could even have won it with the very last attack, firing a shot with his left foot that was stopped by Albania goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha.\n\nCroatia now have one point from

A lot of energy was invested to lead 2-1 and then we get goal in added time. It is difficult to get a goal in the last minute.\n\n\"The first half was very bad and the second much better, which is encouraging for the match with Italy, the victory over Italy will take us further.

In the second half, of course it was a different image. We were much more aggressive, dominant.\n\n\"What I want to say is that this is football, this is why everyone loves football. In the last seconds, sometimes you score a goal to win, sometimes you concede, unfortunately that is what happened to us.\"\n\nAlbanian midfielder Qazim Laci who opened the scoring in the 11th minute: \"This result will give us a confidence to move forward, to believe in ourselves.\n\n\"The game with Spain will be more difficult but we will give the maximum to have a victory.\"\n\nAlbanian midfielder Klaus Gjasula, whose own goal put Croatia ahead before he netted the added time equaliser: \"2-2 is okay.

Chris Sutton reveals all on why he SLAPPED David Beckham\n\nCroatia manager Zlatko Dalic has had a pop at England following his side's defeat against Spain at Euro 2024.\n\nDalic's side got their tournament off to the worst possible start on Saturday, losing 3-0 having trailed by the same scoreline at half time in the game, managing to keep it as it was in the second half.\n\nTheir hopes of reaching the knockout stages aren't over, however, with Italy and Albania left to play in the groups, though they can hardly afford to slip up again given the goal difference hit they took in their opening match.\n\nDalic, who has been in charge of Croatia since 2017, has come out swinging before their tie against Albania on Wednesday, however, defending his side and pointing to their achievements from the last few international tournaments.\n\nIn doing so, he namechecked England, who many are tipping for success in Germany, insisting his side have been more successful than Gareth Southgate's outfit but aren't as fancied.\n\nCroatia manager Zlatko Dalic has criticised England following his side's defeat by Spain\n\nCroatia lost 3-0 in their opening match of Euro 2024, with Dalic slamming the ensuing criticism\n\nHe pointed to England's favourites tag and their lack of success in recent tournaments\n\n'We are always the dark horse, we are always not among the favourites, nobody believes in us but in the past six years we have won three medals,' he said. 'After France, our national team is the first team to have done this so I always keep saying that Croatia deserves greater respect from everyone else for what we have managed to do.\n\n'We have won three medals, England won one 50 years ago but they are a great team, we are not, we are always the dark horse. We are little but we are brave, we will fight and we have the evidence of thousands of Croats in Berlin. We are a nation that is entitled to feel proud and our results show that we are better than our perception.\n\n'I know after this defeat [against Spain] there is a lot of pessimism and negativity but we will give our best and we are doing the best to be the best we can. Everything we have done in the past six, seven years, we have to look at that and feel proud. Croatia is much better than is said and seen in the public.'\n\nCroatia have never won a major trophy, but have come close in recent years, finishing runners up to France in the 2018 World Cup, finishing third in the 2022 edition and losing to Spain on penalties in the final of the most recent Nations League.\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup, they beat England on their ways to the final, where they went down against France, losing 4-2 in the final in Russia.\n\nCroatia also came out on top in the last game the two sides played, winning 1-0 in the Nations League back in 2021.\n\nTheir result against Spain however has left fans questioning their credentials for Euro 2024, with a number of players in their squad at the back-end of their careers after helping their side to success over the last few years.\n\nEngland, meanwhile, are favourites to win the tournament despite not winning a major trophy since 1966, and won their tournament opener against Serbia on Sunday night.\n\nEngland came up short against Croatia in the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup in Russia\n\nSouthgate's side did, however, win their opening game of Euro 2024, beating Serbia on Sunday night\n\nIn 2020, they finished runners up to Italy at the European Championship, falling short on penalties on home turf at Wembley.\n\nThey also finished third in the Nations League in 2019, but there are high hopes for success in Germany come the end of the tournament on July 14.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With hopes of advancing at stake, the match promises to be crucial. Key points include Croatia's possession stats against Spain and Albania's disciplinary issues.\n\nIn a high-stakes Group B clash, Croatia will face Albania in their second match of the European Championship. Both teams are coming off opening-game losses and must win to keep their advancement hopes alive. With key players nursing injuries and fans' disciplinary actions under scrutiny, it's a match not to be missed.\n\nCroatia, led by Luka Modric, is aiming to bounce back from a 3-0 defeat against Spain. Despite the loss, Croatia managed to keep possession for 54% of the game, a remarkable feat against Spain. Albania, on the other hand, gave defending champions Italy a scare with a quick goal but fell 2-1.\n\nAdding to the tension, Albania faces disciplinary charges for fan behavior during their first match. As both teams gear up, Croatia's midfielder Lovro Majer and Albania's defender Mario Mitaj emphasize the critical nature of this match. With the stakes so high, the outcome will undoubtedly shape Group B's future.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Mitaj", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mario Mitaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovro_Majer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lovro Majer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Science_Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Science Fiction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/18_06_2024_10_34_05_6828785.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

It should have been a moment for Albania to fear and retreat, but they stepped forward and intercepted Modric's rather feeble through ball attempt. Seconds later, Kristjan Asllani was in on goal, only to be denied by Dominik Livakovic.\n\nIt was a moment that summed up not only the pattern of the first half, but Modric and Croatia's struggles to control Albania. Alongside Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic, possession was always likely to come easily, but not only did Croatia struggle to muster inspiration after going a goal behind, but they failed to stop a string of good chances being created from similar avenues before half time.\n\nUltimately, that lack of control cost them in the end, conceding a late equaliser after taking a 2-1 lead in the second half. Now it looks like a tall order to qualify; they need to beat Italy, but on this showing and that against Spain, they do not have the energy.\n\nThrough long balls over the top or central through balls, Albania should have been out of sight; Qazim Laci opened the scoring with a header on 11 minutes, Asllani failed to double the lead before Rey Manej's header was thwarted by another Livakovic save.\n\nEverything was coming through the same structure for Sylvinho's side, who had clearly learnt a lot from their opening defeat to Italy.\n\nThey countered using their pace and power to overwhelm Croatia and Modric in particular. What has looked effortless and second nature for 15 years - control, dictation, tempo setting - suddenly looked a challenge for the Real Madrid man. Albania were supposed to be the whipping boys of the group of death which involves Spain and Italy too. If they were too much for Croatia, who wouldn't be?\n\nModric is now 38, Ivan Perisic is 35; they have defied logic and sense in the last three tournaments, but this one has, unfortunately, just not been the same. Kovacic and Brosovic, the other remaining members of an incredible generation of Croatian midfielders, battled to regain control in a second half which showed Croatia did carry more of a threat.\n\nAndreij Kramaric, who turns 33 today, levelled and Klaus Gjasula's unfortunate own goal appeared to have completed the turnaround. But then Gjasula struck in stoppage time and it was hard to avoid the feeling that it may be a tournament too far for Croatia and Modric.\n\nLosing to Spain without laying a glove on them was a warning sign. Croatia may be about to go home early and there will need to be a lot of planning of how to take this team forward. Time comes for everyone, but Modric has been the beating heart of this team for so long. If they are knocked out, it may take a while to recover and go again.\n\nEventually, we can look back and marvel at the sheer relentlessness of Luka Modric's quality. Football looked very different at the elite level before he arrived, and it'll be a worse place when he's gone.

We have to go for the win against Italy,\" coach Zlatko Dalic said after his side's 2-2 draw in Hamburg left them with one point and bottom of Group B on goal difference.\n\nAgainst Albania, ranked 56 places lower, they were shocked by an early goal and did not recover until the second half when they flooded forward and scored twice in quick succession - before Klaus Gjasula snatched a stoppage-time equaliser.\n\n\"First half we played badly. We were very slow. In the second half we played a lot better, a lot more decisive,\" added Dalic.\n\n\"We gave our all to get to 2-1 and for 45 minutes our opponent couldn\u00b4t pass the half-way line, and then in extra time we allowed them to come at us and we conceded this goal.\"\n\nDIFFICULT STORY\n\nDalic, whose team lost their opening game 3-0 to Spain, said he had not expected the tournament to be so hard for Croatia but noted other teams with big pedigree had struggled too.\n\n\"We didn\u00b4t expect to have such a difficult story in these two matches, it has been a struggle,\" he said.\n\n\"The World Cup was two years ago and slowly our players are getting older, and this whole tournament has shown us that everyone is having a hard time ... It is very open and the teams are pretty equal.\"\n\nHis players acknowledged they must improve.\n\n\"The disappointment is huge. Something like this must not happen to a team like us. We were leading and should have ended this calmly, but this is a lesson to learn,\" midfielder Luka Sucic said.\n\n\"The second half was better, it shows how to start against Italy ... If we play like in the second half we will surely get through this group.\"\n\nMan of the match Andrej Kramaric, who scored Croatia's first goal, was philosophical.\n\n\"This is why everyone loves football.

In a punchy press conference, Dalic said he is fed up of his team being patronised and took aim at those writing off his side after a difficult start in Germany. Croatia, whose base is in Neuruppin, an hour northwest of Berlin, lost their opening Group B match 3-0 to Spain.\n\n\"It wasn't a pretty sight, it wasn't great to watch, we didn't get a great feeling,\" Dalic said of the defeat, before airing his frustrations. \"But we are always the dark horse, we are always not among the favourites, nobody believes in us but in the past six years we have won three medals. After France, our national team is the first team to have done this so I always keep saying that Croatia deserves greater respect from everyone else for what we have managed to do.\n\n\"We have won three medals, England won one [more than] 50 years ago but they are a great team, we are not, we are always the dark horse. We are little but we are brave, we will fight and we have the evidence of thousands of Croats in Berlin. We are a nation that is entitled to feel proud and our results show that we are better than our perception.\n\n\"I know after this defeat [to Spain] there is a lot of pessimism and negativity but we will give our best and we are doing the best to be the best we can. Everything we have done in the past six, seven years, we have to look at that and feel proud. Croatia is much better than is said and seen in the public.\"\n\nCroatia were runners-up at the World Cup in Russia in 2018, third in Qatar in 2022 and Nations League runners-up last year.

We were very slow. In the second half we played a lot better, a lot more decisive,\" added Dalic.\n\n\"We gave our all to get to 2-1 and for 45 minutes our opponent couldn't pass the half-way line, and then in extra time we allowed them to come at us and we conceded this goal.\"\n\nDIFFICULT STORY\n\nDalic, whose team lost their opening game 3-0 to Spain, said he had not expected the tournament to be so hard for Croatia but noted other teams with big pedigree had struggled too.\n\n\"We didn't expect to have such a difficult story in these two matches, it has been a struggle,\" he said.\n\n\"The World Cup was two years ago and slowly our players are getting older, and this whole tournament has shown us that everyone is having a hard time ... It is very open and the teams are pretty equal.\"\n\nHis players acknowledged they must improve.\n\n\"The disappointment is huge. Something like this must not happen to a team like us. We were leading and should have ended this calmly, but this is a lesson to learn,\" midfielder Luka Sucic said.\n\n\"The second half was better, it shows how to start against Italy ... If we play like in the second half we will surely get through this group.\"\n\nMan of the match Andrej Kramaric, who scored Croatia's first goal, was philosophical.\n\n\"This is why everyone loves football.

ends level", "body": "Klaus Gjasula redeemed himself with a dramatic last-gasp equaliser as Albania drew 2-2 with Croatia in an absolute thriller at Euro 2024.\n\nThe Darmstadt midfielder swept home in the fifth minute of second-half stoppage time in Hamburg, where he used to ply his club trade, 20 minutes after his unfortunate own goal completed a dramatic late turnaround that looked to have Croatia on course for a vital comeback victory in Group B.\n\nCroatia had scored twice in the space of just three minutes to stun their opponents, with birthday boy Andrej Kramaric first rifling in low after Zlatko Dalic's men had turned up the tempo considerably following a dreadful first half in which they deservedly trailed courtesy of Qazim Laci's early glancing header.\n\nAlbania got the latest early goal that their efforts certainly deserve, with Sparta Prague's Laci - who, along with ex-Watford forward Rey Manaj, was one of two changes made by head coach Sylvinho as Chelsea's Armando Broja and Taulant Seferi both dropped to the bench - glancing home a header from Kristjan Asllani's 11th-minute cross, straight under the hands of goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic.\n\nThe ever-dangerous Bajrami had a shot deflected wide as they swarmed all over Croatia, who had almost 70 per cent possession in the first half but only one effort on target as they moved the ball too slowly and struggled to create chances - with captain and talisman Luka Modric certainly not immune.\n\nThey were indebted to Livakovic for two huge saves to keep the scoreline at 1-0 at the break, with Asllani and Manaj both thwarted.\n\nCroatia created very little in the first half aside from a couple of Marcelo Brozovic potshots and a header from Kramatic that was brilliantly kept out by Brentford goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha, before the offside flag went up.\n\nCroatia sent on Luka Susic and Mario Pasalic for Brozovic and Lovro Majer at the break and immediately flicked a switch with far more urgency, aggression and purpose on the ball as they piled on the pressure, knowing they likely had 45 minutes to save their European Championship campaign with only defending champions Italy left to come in Group B in Leipzig on Monday night.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Croats, having faced a tough 3-0 defeat against Spain, are desperate to prove their mettle and reassert themselves as strong contenders in the tournament. Despite a rocky start where they conceded all three goals in the first half, Zlatko Dalic's squad managed to pull themselves together post-break, aiming to minimize further damage.\n\nBefore this setback, Croatia had been on a commendable streak, unbeaten in six matches and even securing a victory against the 2016 champions, Portugal. This previous success is something they'll be hoping to draw on when they step onto the pitch against Albania.\n\nOn the other side, Albania also faces a challenging path ahead after their 2-1 loss to Italy. They initially took everyone by surprise with an early goal from Nedim Bajrami but couldn't hold off the reigning champions for long. Despite showing promise during the qualifiers, Albania often struggles when up against top-tier teams, a pattern that has left them with a less than stellar record in recent outings.\n\nBoth teams are under pressure to turn their fortunes around in this match if they hope to keep their Euro dreams alive. With Croatia's track record and Albania's resilience, this upcoming game promises to be an intense battle as each team fights to claim those crucial points.\n\nCroatia vs Albania Odds\n\nHere are the latest odds:\n\nCroatia - 1/2 Draw - 7/2 Albania - 7/1 Croatia vs Albania Betting Tips Both teams to score - 6/5 (Paddy Power) Croatia to win and under 3.5 goals - 21/20 (BetVictor)\n\n18+ | Gamble responsibly |gambleaware.org | Odds subject to change\n\nCroatia vs Albania Betting Offer\n\nNew British customers can enjoy \u00a310 in free bets when they register and place \u00a310 in bets with All British Casino during the Euros.

They were off the mark early once again in their second group match this afternoon with Qazim Laci slamming home a header from Jasir Asani's excellent cross after 11 minutes.\n\nLaci was completely free to head home in the Croatia box with goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic at fault, unable to prevent the ball from squirming beneath him.\n\nWhile questions will be asked of the goalkeeper, former England and Arsenal striker Wright laid some of the blame at the feet of Real Madrid star Modric.\n\nThe midfielder is still the heartbeat of the Croatian team at the age of 38 and for over a decade, has been one of the game's best operators in the middle of the park,\n\nBut Wright felt the six-time Champions League winner was guilty of 'passing responsibility' for Albania's opener.\n\n'We have to look at Modric in that situation,' Wright told ITV when analysing the goal, pointing out Modric's decision not to track his marker into the box.\n\n'He has to take responsibility. Instead, he's seen out Laci, he's passed him on because the centre half has got dragged out. He's passed him on and no one has taken notice.\n\n'Someone has got to take him [Laci], you can't just point to him because you're Luka Modric. See him out!'\n\nCroatia lost their opening game of the competition to Spain with La Roja cruising to a 3-0 win on Saturday.\n\nDefeat to Albania would have left them in a desperate scrap to reach the knockout stages of the competition. But an equaliser from Andrej Kramaric and an own goal from Klaus Gjasula put them back in control.\n\nBut Albania rescued a point with Gjasula cancelling out his own goal with a dramatic 95th minute equaliser.\n\nGroup stage elimination would serve as a major disappointment for the nation who have regular reached the latter stages of major international competitions in recent years.\n\nCroatia finished third in the 2022 World Cup, having lost to France in the 2018 final.\n\nMORE : 'Putin is a d**khead' chant accidentally broadcast on Russian TV during Euros match\n\nMORE : Conor McGregor

We have two difficult matches. It's not over, keep your heads up.

We need to be better... It's up to me to turn things around, point out the flaws and not dwell too much on the Spain match.\"\n\nDespite being viewed as minnows, Albania topped their qualifying group over teams such as the Czech Republic and Poland and are not at the tournament to make up the numbers.\n\nTheir Brazilian coach Sylvinho will try to keep his team disciplined before hitting Croatia on the break -- as they did against Italy with a goal after 23 seconds and so nearly again at the end when they narrowly failed to equalise.\n\n\"I have seen other sides in this tournament. If you try and go toe-to-toe with them, they will score five or six against you,\" he said. \"It's only our second time here in the Euros.

We will be taking you through every moment, every bulge of the net, every woodwork hit and every crunching tackle made as Croatia aim to bounce back from their disappointing 3-0 defeat to Spain in the tournament's opening round of matches.\n\nAs for the Albanians, they nearly caused a mighty upset in their opening encounter with Italy, scoring after just 23 seconds, but the current European champions turned it around in true Azzurri fashion, eventually winning 2-1 thanks to goals from Alessandro Bastoni and Nicolo Barella.\n\nDespite their underwhelming display against Spain, the Croatian squad are well used to playing on the biggest stage and will no doubt be favourites for this. Zlatko Dalic's side reached the 2018 World Cup final and the penultimate stages in Qatar in 2022.\n\nThey have recovered from slow starts before, progressing from the group stage at Euro 2020 despite losing to England in their opening game, and as previously mentioned at the last World Cup they reached the semi-finals after an opening loss to Morocco.\n\n\"There is no room for pessimism, everything is still in our hands,\" Dalic said. \"Of course, we have to be better. It's my job to turn the team around\" he continued.\n\nTheir goal difference surely isn't doing them any favours in the group but a big win in Hamburg today can make up for it, especially with Italy taking on Spain tomorrow night.\n\nEuro 2024 has brought us plenty of goals thus far, let's hope that continues today.

After France, our national team is the first team to have done this so I always keep saying that Croatia deserves greater respect from everyone else for what we have managed to do.\n\n\"We have won three medals, England won one [more than] 50 years ago but they are a great team, we are not, we are always the dark horse. We are little but we are brave, we will fight and we have the evidence of thousands of Croats in Berlin. We are a nation that is entitled to feel proud and our results show that we are better than our perception.\"\n\nDalic added: \"I know after this defeat [against Spain] there is a lot of pessimism and negativity but we will give our best and we are doing the best to be the best we can. Everything we have done in the past six, seven years, we have to look at that and feel proud. Croatia is much better than is said and seen in the public.\"\n\nCroatia finished runners-up at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, before finishing third in Qatar and runners-up in the Nations League last year. In the two previous European championships, they were knocked out of the Last 16 by Portugal and Spain respectively.\n\nEngland, who won the World Cup in 1966, were runners-up at the delayed Euro 2020 and finished third in the 2019 Nations League. They lost the third-place match against Belgium at the 2018 World Cup and were knocked out of the quarter-finals by France in Qatar.\n\nAgainst Albania, Dalic is expected to switch up his starting XI, specifically in midfield. Albania - who made history in their 2-1 defeat to holders Italy with the fastest-ever European Championship goal - are competing in only their second major finals, after a group-stage exit from Euro 2016 when they claimed a memorable win over Romania.\n\nAnd Dalic is not underestimating the difficulty of Wednesday's match. \"We have to be and feel alive until the end of the match,\" he said. \"We cannot lose our heads and try to force things, but with our quality and our own play, do what we've envisaged because tomorrow we'll go for victory and three points, but patience will be the key tomorrow.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

'After France, our national team is the first team to have done this so I always keep saying that Croatia deserves greater respect from everyone else for what we have managed to do.\n\nRead More Revealed: The cocktail of supplements England stars are taking at Euro 2024 and how they power them\n\n'We have won three medals, England won one 50 years ago but they are a great team, we are not, we are always the dark horse. We are little but we are brave, we will fight and we have the evidence of thousands of Croats in Berlin. We are a nation that is entitled to feel proud and our results show that we are better than our perception.\n\n'I know after this defeat [against Spain] there is a lot of pessimism and negativity but we will give our best and we are doing the best to be the best we can. Everything we have done in the past six, seven years, we have to look at that and feel proud. Croatia is much better than is said and seen in the public.'\n\nCroatia have never won a major trophy, but have come close in recent years, finishing runners up to France in the 2018 World Cup, finishing third in the 2022 edition and losing to Spain on penaties in the final of the most recent Nations League.\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup, they beat England on their ways to the final, where they went down against France, losing 4-2 in the final in Russia.\n\nThe Croats also came out on top in the last game the two sides played, winning 1-0 in the Nations League back in 2021.\n\nTheir result against Spain however has left fans questioning their credentials for Euro 2024, with a number of players in their squad at the back-end of their careers after helping their side to success over the

It's my job to turn the team around.\"\n\nRumours of a rift in the camp after Perisic allowed Bruno Petkovic to take a late penalty, which was saved by Spain goalkeeper Unai Simon, have been played down despite Dalic publicly criticising his striker.\n\n\"I think that situation is over. The coach said everything on that topic,\" winger Lovro Majer said on Monday.\n\n\"Bruno took the penalty, unfortunately he didn't score, it can happen to anyone. It's a finished story and there's no need to add anything special.\"\n\nDalic is expected to opt for a switch in formation, potentially breaking up the midfield trio of Modric, Kovacic and Brozovic.\n\nFormer Inter Milan player Brozovic has increasingly looked off the pace for Croatia since his move to Saudi club Al-Nassr last year.\n\nCroatia did create chances against Spain and were starting to look the more dangerous of the two teams when one through ball from Fabian Ruiz split them open and sent Alvaro Morata in on goal to score the first goal.\n\n\"I don't think it looked as bad as the result suggested,\" said Majer.\n\n\"It's football, sometimes you concede and you don't score, but it didn't look so terrible.\"\n\nCroatia have experience of recovering from similar positions at major tournaments -- they progressed from the group stage at Euro 2020 despite an opening 1-0 loss to England and started their excellent Qatar World Cup campaign with a goalless draw against Morocco.", "source": {"uri": "standardmedia.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Standard Digital News - Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@standardmedia.co.ke", "name":

He's such a complete player and such a nice guy as well. Very humble. And if he keeps doing his thing, the way he's doing right now, he can be one of the best.\"\n\nMusiala opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a goal that was furiously protested by Hungary. G\u00fcndo\u011fan had set that up and got on the scoresheet himself in the second half.\n\nMusiala had netted Germany's second goal in the 5-1 opening victory over Scotland on Friday to kick off Euro 2024. Hungary lost 3-1 to Switzerland on Saturday and now faces an uphill challenge to advance.\n\n\"He did brilliant in both games,\" Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said.\n\n\"Not only the two goals, I think every situation or offensive proposition is pretty tough for the opponent to defend.\n\n\"I think it's important for him not to deal with the pressure, just to deal with his capability to solve any offensive one-on-one situations ... He should not think about the pressure, because he's brilliant in just playing soccer.\"\n\nXherdan Shaqiri's stunning first-half strike secured a 1-1 draw for Switzerland against Scotland on Wednesday.\n\nThe 32-year-old Chicago Fire forward rolled back the years with a first-time curling effort from about 20 meters out at Cologne Stadium.\n\nScotland had led from the 13th minute when Scott McTominay's shot took a wicked deflection off Fabian Sch\u00e4r to beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer.\n\nBut Shaqiri pounced on Anthony Ralston's loose pass in the 26th to even the match.\n\nThe draw leaves Switzerland second in Group B on four points, while Scotland's hopes of advancing to the round of 16 depend on the result of its final game against Hungary on Sunday.\n\nAlbania substitute Klaus Gjasula had the rare experience of scoring for both teams in an intense 2-2 draw with Croatia that could make it difficult for each to survive the group stage at Euro 2024.\n\nThe Croatian players were particularly disappointed with the result in Hamburg after Gjasula's stoppage-time goal denied them a much-needed win after they lost 3-0 to Spain in their opening Group B match.\n\n\"My first minutes on the pitch were very, very difficult for me not only for the own goal but also other situations,\" Gjasula said.\n\n\"Then God wanted and gave me the opportunity to score. A very beautiful, historic day for me.\"\n\nIn the first-ever competitive match between the two Balkan teams, Croatia tried to set the pace from the start, but it was Albania's Qazim Laci who scored first, heading in a cross from the right flank in the 11th minute.\n\nAndrej Kramari\u0107 equalised in the 74th minute before Gjasula's own goal made it 2-1 for Croatia just two minutes later.\n\nAt that point, Croatia looked in control but a late surge by Albania changed everything once again as Gjasula redeemed himself by scoring with a low shot in the 95th minute.\n\nIt was a thrilling end-to-match that left both Croatia and Albania in a precarious situation in the group. Albania lost to defending champion Italy 2-1 in its first match.\n\nUEFA fined the Albanian and Serbian soccer federations 10,000 euros ($16,270) each on Wednesday for fans displaying banners with nationalist maps at European Championship games.\n\nEach federation was charged with \"transmitting provocative messages not fit for a sports event\" because they are responsible for the conduct of their fans at stadiums.\n\nAlbania fans displayed a banner with a map of their country extending its borders into the territory of neighbouring countries. It was shown during the 2-1 loss against Italy on Saturday in Dortmund.\n\nSerbia fans' banner included the independent territory of Kosovo and the slogan \"No Surrender\" at a 1-0 loss against England in Gelsenkirchen. A case was prosecuted by FIFA at the 2022 World Cup when players were photographed with a similar banner in their locker room ahead of a game against Brazil.\n\nUEFA also opened a separate investigation into alleged discrimination by Serbia fans. The Kosovo soccer federation filed a formal complaint with UEFA.\n\nThe Albanian federation was fined a further $44,000 for fans lighting flares and fireworks, throwing beer cups and a fan who went on the field.\n\nTwo kings and a prince are set to watch the soccer aristocrats playing on the field at European Championship games.\n\nKing Frederik X of Denmark and the first in line to the British throne, Prince William, will be together in the VVIP seats when their national teams meet in Frankfurt.\n\n\"It's a big honour. I'm a big fan of the Danish royal family,\" Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel said on Wednesday.\n\nSchmeichel previously met Prince William at the FA Cup final in May 2021, when the future king also presented him with the trophy as captain of the winning Leicester team against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium.\n\nKing Felipe VI of Spain is due to attend the later game when his national team plays Italy in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nUEFA confirmed the scheduled royal visits to the month-long tournament in Germany.\n\nPrince William is the longtime president of the English Football Association and a fan of Premier League team Aston Villa, which has two players in the England squad at Euro 2024.\n\nKing Frederik, who became monarch in January on the abdication of his mother Queen Margrethe II, is a former member of the International Olympic Committee.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Croatia vs Albania descends into a basketball match, with commentators breathless", "body": "In one of the most chaotic and entertaining matches of Euro 2024 so far, Croatia and Albania went blow for blow until the referee finally called time on a frantic contest.\n\nCroatia, who trailed at half-time and looked bereft of ideas in attack, thought they had completed an impressive turnaround after the break.\n\nThe equaliser was scored by Andrej Kramaric, who found himself free and unmarked in the box, before guiding a low shot through the legs of Elseid Hysaj and into the bottom left corner.\n\nAnd just two minutes later, Croatia were in front. A powerful run down the left from substitute Mario Pasalic led to a cut back and a hurried shot. Albania's goal had led a charmed life for some time but their fortune ran out as a ricochet off Klaus Gjasula flew into the net, leaving goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha helpless.\n\nBoth goals were crucial for Croatia, who despite their second-half dominance had looked in real danger of falling to an ignominious defeat against one of the lowest ranked teams in the tournament.\n\nBut the drama did not end there. In added time, Gjasula made amends for his own goal, latching onto a cross and finishing coolly to send the Albanian fans into raptures.\n\nLike in their opening game against Italy, Sylvinho's side were unable to hold onto their narrow lead, despite some resilient defending for long periods. This time, though, they rallied themselves after conceding twice and earned a deserved draw in a finale that left the commentators breathless.\n\nCroatia's players were visibly dejected at full time. They will know that qualification is now likely to depend on beating Italy in their final group match.\n\nThis is how to watch Euro 2024 live streams from anywhere in the world, while we have a guide on how to get Euro 2024 tickets if you're still looking to go to the tournament.

I always say we deserve more respect, England won (1966 World Cup) 50 years ago and they're a 'great team', but we're the dark horse.\n\n\"We have the results to show we're better than perceived. After this defeat there's a more negative outlook, but we're looking forward to the next match.\"\n\nDalic said there would be changes to his starting XI.\n\nCroatian media reports have suggested he will break up his midfield trio of Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic, with the latter expected to miss out.\n\nAlbania showed in their opening 2-1 defeat by holders Italy -- when they scored the fastest ever European Championship goal -- that they will not be pushovers in a tough group.\n\n\"We have to be and feel alive until the end of the match,\" added Dalic.\n\n\"We cannot lose our heads and try to force things, but with our quality and our own play, do what we've envisaged because tomorrow we'll go for victory and three points, but patience will be the key tomorrow.\"\n\nAlbania are playing in only their second major finals, after a group-stage exit from Euro 2016 when they claimed a memorable win over Romania.\n\nHead coach Sylvinho is still hopeful his men can pull off an even bigger shock in Germany.\n\n\"There's a beautiful path ahead of us,\" said the former Brazil left-back.\n\n\"I think we played quite a good match (against Italy). We didn't collapse, we were there until the very end and we had the chance to equalise and that's good...\n\n\"This is a very tough group, definitely, but I believe it can be true joy for us, because we're here playing against the best teams and we can learn from them.\n\n\"We'll give it our best shot.

We're playing against the best teams and learning from them,\" said their coach Sylvinho, declaring his team 100% fit for the game in Hamburg.\n\n\"These teams that have players from Manchester City, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, they have a very high technical level, it's a great thing to play against these teams.

The 2018 World Cup runners-up are currently sat at the bottom of Group A with 1 point from two games and a goal difference of -3. Zlatko Dalic's side are at the serious risk of being knocked out with them facing Italy in their final game of the group stage.\n\nDalic lined up his side in a 4-3-3 with a midfield trio of Marcelo Brozovic, Mateo Kovacic and Luka Modric. From the get go, Croatia looked uninspiring, failing to create any danger and struggling to connect their lines from back to front. Albania looked threatning on the counter and punished them early in the game.\n\nQazim Laci got the faintest of touches on Asani's cross from the right and Croatian goalkeeper failed to keep the ball out of net. Dalic's side have already given up four first half goals this tournament and lost all sense of grip on the game beyond this point struggling to impose or create any meaningful danger.\n\nThe second half substitution did prompt a sense of urgency with Mateo Kovaci moving into a slightly deeper midfield role and Modric pushing up a little. The overall result however was more of the same. They found a spell of effective possession and scored two goals via Andrej Kramaric and an own goal from Klaus Gjasula. Albania pulled a rabbit out of their hat in the 95th minute, with Gjasula turning hero scoring from a cutback and becoming just the second player to score a goal and an own goal in the same Euros game after Anton Ondrus in 1976.\n\nLuka Modric, despite what the numbers might suggest, did not have a great showing.

However, most of those footballers are now in the twilights of their career, with the young players in the squad not quite to the same standard.\n\nDespite their poor performance in their opening game at Euro 2024, their manager feels that there has been a lack of respect given to his team ahead of this tournament.\n\nREAD HERE: The Turkish Commentary For Arda Guler's Worldie Was Amazing\n\nCroatia reached a World Cup final in 2018, having also finished third in the 2022 edition of the tournament. Add to that their third place finish in 1998, and it's fair to say that the Balkan nation have been one of the most successful European countries of the last few decades (even if they have never got beyond the quarter-finals at the Euros). They also came second in the 2023 edition of the UEFA Nations League.\n\nThey have consistently been labelled as 'dark horses' heading into major tournaments during this period, a tag that their manager actually feels is quite disrespectful.\n\nSpeaking ahead of their Euro 2024 game against Albania, Croatia boss Zlatko Dalic threw a cheeky dig at England by comparing the major tournament record between the two nations.\n\nIt wasn't a pretty sight, it wasn't great to watch, we didn't get a great feeling.\n\nBut we are always the dark horse, we are always not among the favourites, nobody believes in us but in the past six years we have won three medals.\n\nAfter France, our national team is the first team to have done this so I always keep saying that Croatia deserves greater respect from everyone else for what we have managed to do.\n\nWe have won three medals, England won one [more than] 50 years ago but they are a great team, we are not, we are always the dark horse.\n\nWe are little but we are brave, we will fight and we have the evidence of thousands of Croats in Berlin. We are a nation that is entitled to feel proud and our results show that we are better than our perception.\n\nI know after this defeat [to Spain] there is a lot of pessimism and negativity but we will give our best and we are doing the best to be the best we can.\n\nEverything we have done in the past six, seven years, we have to look at that and feel proud. Croatia is much better than is said and seen in the public.\n\nCroatia defeated England in the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup, with the English having finished no better than fourth in any edition of that tournament from 1970 onwards. They were also relegated from the same edition of the UEFA Nations league that the Croatians finished second in.\n\nZlatko Dalic clearly feels that while his side have been underrated by many, the English do not deserve the praise they have received in some quarters ahead of Euro 2024.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_connaughton@balls.ie", "name": "Gary Connaughton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Peri\u0161i\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dark horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_Turan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arda Turan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balkans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/National_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/National Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNlxcXC8xOTExMzUxN1xcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wNi0xOVQxMTM0MTkuOTcyLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiIzMTFmNTczNDNjNDFlNGEzMjI4YTQzNjlmN2I2MmFmYjlhNDk1M2Y0In0=/croatiamanagerthrowscheekydigatenglandovertheirlackofsuccessballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665319", "eventUri": "eng-9665319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Vargas and Michel Aebischer from midfield.\n\nScotland, meanwhile, recalled Billy Gilmour, who joined Scott McTominay, John McGinn and Callum McGregor in midfield.\n\nThe Tartan Army went ahead after 13 minutes after an unfortunate own goal Fabian Schar, who deflected a shot in the near post into his own net.\n\nShaqiri got the equaliser for the Swiss 13 minutes later with a strike from a rebound.\n\nBreel Embolo thought he had netted the winner for Murat Yakin's men after finding the back of the net in the dying minutes but the goal was disallowed by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) for offside.\n\nThe Swiss moved to four points in second spot in the group while Scotland picked up their first point in third place.\n\nCroatia 2-2 Albania\n\nCroatia's progression in the tournament is hanging by a thread after they were held to a 2-2 draw by Albania in the penultimate Group B clash at Volksparkstadion.\n\nCroatia made three changes following their heavy defeat against Spain in their opener, as Bruno Petkovic, Josip Juranovic and Ivan Perisic were recalled.\n\nAfter netting the fastest goal in the history of the tournament against Italy in their 2-1 loss against Italy in their opening game, Albania had another dream start after going ahead within the first 11 minutes courtesy of Qazim Laci's bullet header from close-range.\n\nAndrej Kramaric only equalised for the Chequered Ones with 16 minutes remaining after showing great composure from a through ball by Ante Budimir.\n\nZlatko Dalic's charges went ahead two minutes later after an own goal by Klaus Gjasula, who deflected a shot into the wrong net.\n\nHowever, Gjasula redeemed himself in added time after he netted the equaliser for Albania with a strike from a rebound.", "source": {"uri": "snl24.com",

They were also wearing their pink kit for the first time in the tournament, which is the fastest-selling away shirt in the national team's history.\n\nIn the same group we had the first Euros goal ever scored by a player based in MLS (or North or South America for that matter) as Scotland and Switzerland drew 1-1. And the days games actually began with half of the second round of matches in group B where Albania secured that dramatic draw (2-2) with Croatia.\n\nHere our writers run you through the highlights of the day.\n\nA 2-0 victory over Hungary sent Germany through to the last 16, and they got there pretty comfortably. Although they have not played any top sides so far, they look a fearsome prospect and even the better teams in the tournament will not fancy facing them, especially as they are playing at home.\n\nHow would opponents cope with Toni Kroos dropping in at left centre-back, for example? With Antonio Rudiger (pictured top) being happy to bring the ball out, you will always have somebody to watch even in the back line.\n\nIf the Germany full-backs go forward, it pushes Musiala and Florian Wirtz into central pockets of space either side of Kai Havertz, with Gundogan arriving late to back them up, meaning they have four quality players in central areas, and, as we have seen already, some of them are always looking to pick up the ball behind the backs of the opposition midfielders and some are making runs in behind.\n\nIf you, as the opponent, use two holding midfielders to try to add numbers in the middle, you will be trying to deal with Gundogan and one of Musiala or Wirtz, possibly both, leaving Robert Andrich spare. He may not be quite as technically proficient as the others, so you may be happy with that, but Andrich is clearly not a passenger.\n\nBasically, they pose plenty of problems, and beyond the individual quality of the players, you have to consider the fact that their movements are incredibly well synchronised: for example, Wirtz will trot inside from the right to bring the opposition left-back inside while Kroos switches the ball to the right wing, so Joshua Kimmich has plenty of space to receive.\n\nThey look just about as organised as a club side, which is pretty impressive, and they have good options on the bench, too (if Leroy Sane can keep a high level).\n\nThere might be some weaknesses -- it will be interesting to see how the full-backs/Andrich react if they are asked to carry the team's attacking threat, if the opponents pack the middle to take care of Germany's big guns, and while Rudiger and Jonathan Tah are big, imposing centre-backs, they are not especially quick -- but overall, the hosts look capable of doing something special this summer.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are Croatia, who were held to a draw with Albania, just the 56 world ranking places beneath them at 66 (more on this later) and are now in danger of failing to make it out of the group. You can track all the permutations here.\n\nSam Lee\n\nSome players are just more at home in international football. Xherdan Shaqiri has barely been a factor in a bad Chicago Fire team this season, scoring just twice in 12 appearances. He hasn't even been an automatic starting choice for them: not ideal for the third-highest earner in the league, at $8million a year. But put a Swiss shirt on him and he comes alive.\n\nShaqiri was actually a surprise selection for Switzerland's second Euro 2024 game against Scotland on Wednesday. But he not only made an impact, he made history: Shaqiri's brilliant strike in the first half, pinging a shot into the top corner of the top corner, was the first time a player in Major League Soccer has found the net in a European Championship game. In fact, he's the first player from a North or South American club to score at Europe's big jamboree.\n\nIt's the sixth major international tournament in a row that he's found the net in: three Euros, three World Cups. And remarkably, he's still only 32.\n\nIf one trend at Euro 2024 is the number of goals being scored from outside the box, another is the early spike in comical own goals.\n\nA fine example came in the Albania's surprise 2-2 draw with Croatia\n\nAfter Croatia equalised, Albania were trying to reset their defensive shape but Elseid Hysaj was too weak in the challenge, allowing Budimir the chance to pull back for Luka Sucic.\n\nBut his free shot was heroically blocked by captain Berat Djimsiti...\n\n... only for the ball to ricochet off Klaus Gjasula and into the net.\n\nGjasula was unlucky, the ball could have gone anywhere (and he redeemed himself in stoppage time), but it rolled over the line and became the latest hugely unlucky own goal at this tournament.\n\nThere was Germany's Antonio Rudiger accidentally heading the ball backwards into his own net.\n\nAnd Austria's Maximilian Wober also nodding one in (see below) or the ball deflecting off Robin Hranac for the Czech Republic against Portugal.\n\nThis one felt like the cruellest. Albania, just like against Italy, were ahead and could have pulled off the greatest result in their footballing history. They missed out on that chance but they at least rescued a point through that man again, Gjasula.\n\nAnd day six concluded with some administrative own-goal drama.\n\nWhen Fabian Schar raised his leg and deflected Scotland midfielder Scott McTominay's shot from its trajectory into the goalkeeper's arms and instead speared it into the top corner of Switzerland's goal, UEFA gave it as an own goal.\n\nThat brought protest from Scottish supporters and pundits and shortly before the end of the game UEFA reversed its decision, instead awarding the goal to McTominay.\n\nSlovakia's 1-0 win against Belgium on Monday was the biggest European Championship upset ever, with 45 places between the teams. On Wednesday, Albania (66) drew with Croatia (10).\n\nThe problem in football is that international sides only play about a dozen matches a year. Some of those will pit world-beaters against minnows, and others will be non-competitive matches, so there isn't much information to factor into the rankings.\n\nThe precise algorithm used to calculate the rankings has been criticised and subsequently overhauled several times: in 1999, 2006 and most notably, 2018, after complaints that various sides -- particularly Switzerland and Poland -- were trying to 'game' the system by limiting the number of friendlies they played.\n\nThat's different from a sport like tennis or golf, where the best in the world regularly participate in the same tournaments and compete directly against one another. There, a fair ranking system is considerably easier to formulate.\n\nIn 1970, there were no official seeds, and FIFA formed four pots of sides solely in order to keep certain teams apart (Israel and Morocco, in particular).\n\nAhead of the 1974 World Cup, there was a behind-closed-doors vote on which sides would be seeded. For the next few tournaments, the organising committee at least made that session public.\n\nBut this clearly wasn't particularly scientific, and it was only from 1990 onwards that actual empirical results -- performances at previous World Cups -- were taken into consideration. But that effectively discriminated against emerging nations, so from 1998 (the rankings were considered too new to have much meaning in 1994), FIFA could factor in official rankings when selecting the seeds.\n\nSo while the precise rankings system remains something of a mystery to even the keenest football followers, it's worth reiterating that the FIFA rankings do serve a purpose. If the alternative is FIFA executives arbitrarily deciding on seedings among themselves, then it's probably worth having official rankings.\n\nMichael Cox\n\nAnd the good news is we get to do it all

He's also without a title this year -- the first time he's reached May without a trophy since 2018 when he was returning from a right elbow injury.\n\nBut the top-ranked Serb was optimistic about his chances of defending his French Open title.\n\n\"I think I'm on a good route to peak at Roland Garros in Paris,\" Djokovic said. \"Hopefully here in Rome I can play better than I did in Monte Carlo.\"\n\nDjokovic added that his withdrawal from the Madrid Open wasn't because of physical issues.\n\n\"It was not part of the schedule,\" he said. \"The plan was to come here.

Nadal fought back from behind as he lost the opening set to beat qualifier Zizou Bergs of Belgium 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a match that extended to more than 3 hours on Thursday, May 9.\n\nRafael Nadal, who has lost only once in the first round in his last 18 appearances in Rome, was in danger of crashing out early when he lost the opening set despite breaking Zizou's serve first. He struggled a bit with his movement and pace in the first set, which he lost 4-6. However, the Spanish maestro found his footing and his signature fighting spirit in the following sets. He broke Bergs' serve in the third game of the second set, setting the stage for a thrilling comeback.\n\nThe third set was a rollercoaster of emotions, with both players exchanging breaks and showcasing their grit and determination. Nadal's experience and unyielding spirit proved to be the difference-maker, as he broke Bergs' serve in the final game to secure the match, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.\n\n\"It was not my best match. I was practising better than how I played today without a doubt but I found a way to win,\" Nadal said after the match.\n\n\"That is so important at the beginning of the tournament. My game is more unpredictable than before. I didn't play much tennis for the past two years, so it is up and down.

However, Rafael Nadal hopes to meet both the ATP stars at the 2024 French Open.\n\nItalian star Sinner has been in fine form lately and was hoping to play his home tournament. The 22-year-old was troubled by a hip injury during the Madrid Open which forced him to give a walkover to Felix Auger-Aliassime in the semifinal.\n\nSoon after, Sinner announced his withdrawal from the Italian Open as well.\n\nOn the other hand, Alcaraz faced a defeat against Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinal in Madrid. The Spaniard's fitness was a concern even before the tournament began.\n\nHe withdrew from the Italian Open citing an issue with his arm. This meant that two of the best young ATP stars would miss the tournament in Rome.\n\nNadal was asked if a solution to prevent such injuries for young players could be fewer tournaments. The Spanish legend disagreed. According to Nadal, injuries are part of the game. The more you push yourself, the more you risk getting injured.\n\nNadal, who is no stranger to injuries, said that the youngsters can play in Rome another year but the tournament will survive without them. He wished them the best and hoped to see them in Paris.\n\n\"I wish him [Jannik Sinner], and Carlos [Alcaraz] of course, all the best and I wish to meet them in Roland Garros,\" Nadal said during the Italian Open press conference.\n\nRafael Nadal is excited to begin his 2024 Italian Open campaign\n\nIn Italy, Rafael Nadal will be participating in his third clay-court tournament this season.\n\nHe reached the second round in Barcelona and the fourth round in Madrid.

He's hoping to be competitive one last time at the French Open, where he is the record 14-time champion.\n\n\"That was not my best match. I was practicing better than how I played today, without a doubt. But I found a way to win,\" Nadal said. \"My game is more unpredictable than before. I didn't play much tennis for the last two years. So I'm up and down, on and off, but I think I can do it much better than what I did today.\"\n\nRome, where he is a record 10-time champion, is Nadal's last big warmup tournament before Roland Garros starts on May 26.\n\nNadal noted that after overcoming his hip and abdominal issues, the time has come \"to prove myself if I am able to push my body to the limit that I need to push to feel myself ready for what's coming.\"\n\n\"I am not talking only about Roland Garros. I am talking about the next match. I need to lose this fear,\" Nadal said. \"Matches like today help. Some moments I was moving faster. Some moments not. I need to get used to that, to take that risk. ... I feel more ready to try it than before.\"\n\nDuring his 70th win in the Italian capital, the Campo Centrale crowd serenaded Nadal with chants of: \"Ole, Ole, Ole, Na-dal, Na-dal.\"\n\n\"I've always been emotional to play here, these kind of events are the most important events in my tennis career,\" Nadal said. \"The crowd has been always amazing with me, supporting me since the beginning of my tennis career. So I'm super excited to be able to play one more time here.\"\n\nNadal was coming off a straight-set loss to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open. But he has never lost consecutive matches on clay in his entire career and now that impressive statistic remains intact during what he has indicated is his final season on tour.\n\nNadal got out to a strong start, unleashing a 95 mph (153 kph) forehand winner en route to an early break and a 3-1 lead in the first set. But he gave the break right back in the next game when he missed three weak groundstrokes into the net.\n\nThen at 4-4, Nadal double-faulted twice and was broken again to give the 108th-ranked Bergs a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the set.\n\nIn the first set, Nadal committed 16 unforced errors to Bergs' 10.\n\nDuring the first game of the second set, the match was briefly suspended when a spectator in the stands required medical treatment. That allowed Nadal to chat with Carlos Moya, his coach.\n\nAfter the 10-minute suspension of play, Nadal raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set as he upped the power on his shots and became more aggressive.\n\nDuring the third set, Nadal managed to win a point after he fell to the red clay, quickly getting up to resume the rally and then producing a delicate drop-shot winner.

AP\n\nRafael Nadal made a victorious return to Rome, beating qualifier Zizou Bergs from a set down and advancing to the second round of the Italian Open on Thursday.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion ended up defeating his Belgian opponent 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to make a winning start at the clay-court event in Rome, where he is the most successful player of all time with 10 titles.\n\nNadal, who continues his comeback from injury ahead of this year's French Open, faces world number nine Hubert Hurkacz next following his gruelling encounter against Bergs that lasted nearly three hours.\n\nAlso on Nadal's side of the draw are last year's winner, world number four Daniil Medvedev, and the beaten finalist Holger Rune.\n\n\"I'm happy to win a match which was important to me but I didn't play very well,\" admitted Nadal to Sky Sport.\n\n\"I played very badly for about half an hour but then I got a bit better. But I'll have to improve a lot if I'm going to win the next match and I expect to do so.\"\n\nSpaniard Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.\n\nThe 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.\n\nHe returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.\n\nNadal has said that he will only play at the French Open, where he has won 14 times, if he feels competitive and although he showed glimpses of his old self against 108th-ranked Bergs he struggled on his serve and looked a long way from Grand Slam standard.\n\nBattling Nadal\n\nOutsider Bergs, 24, is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour and had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Rune.\n\nThe hard-hitting Belgian pushed his big-name rival all the way, briefly looking like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take victory.\n\nNadal showed signs of form in game four of the first set, when a stunning passing shot and brilliant return of serve in consecutive points took him to 0-40 and an eventual break.\n\nBut Bergs broke back straight away as Nadal's rustiness from his long layoff showed, a super return of serve pulling the Belgian to within a game before he levelled at 3-3 with his serve.\n\nAnd Nadal dropped his serve for a second time as errors began to creep in to his game, a double fault at 15-40 down in game nine handing Bergs the chance to claim the set in the next, which he duly took to love.\n\nNadal came out all guns blazing in the second set however, quickly racing to a 3-0 lead after the first game was interrupted for 10 minutes at 40-0 due to a spectator illness.\n\nHe battled against a spirited Bergs to hold his next three service games and level the match before breaking out some vintage shots to break Bergs three games later and take firm control.\n\nNadal then saved three break points in a row to move 4-2 ahead and served out to win, sealing the deal with his first match point.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

For a brief stretch on Thursday, Rafael Nadal looked every bit of a weary 37-year-old player nearing retirement.\n\nRome, May 9 (AP) For a brief stretch on Thursday, Rafael Nadal looked every bit of a weary 37-year-old player nearing retirement.\n\nStruggling to produce pace off both sides with his groundstrokes, committing an uncharacteristically high number of unforced errors and unable to stay in rallies, Nadal dropped the first set of his first-round match at the Italian Open against Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs.\n\nAlso Read | ICC T20 World Cup 2024 All Squads: Full Players List of All Teams for Ninth Edition of Men's Twenty20 Cricket WC.\n\nThen the fist-pumping, virtually-unbeatable-on-clay, 22-time Grand Slam champion version of Nadal emerged and the Spaniard rallied for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory before an adoring crowd in what will likely be his final tournament at the Foro Italico.\n\nNadal was playing only his 10th match this year after missing nearly all of 2023 with a hip injury that required surgery. He's hoping to be competitive one last time at the French Open, where he is the record 14-time champion.\n\nAlso Read | KL Rahul To Resign As LSG Captain? Three Players Who Could Replace the Current Skipper for Remaining IPL 2024 Matches.\n\n\"That was not my best match. I was practicing better than how I played today, without a doubt. But I found a way to win,\" Nadal said. \"My game is more unpredictable than before. I didn't play much tennis for the last two years. So I'm up and down, on and off, but I think I can do it much better than what I did today.\"\n\nRome, where he is a record 10-time champion, is Nadal's last big warmup tournament before Roland Garros starts on May 26.\n\nNadal noted that after overcoming his hip and abdominal issues, the time has come \"to prove myself if I am able to push my body to the limit that I need to push to feel myself ready for what's coming.\"\n\n\"I am not talking only about Roland Garros. I am talking about the next match. I need to lose this fear,\" Nadal said. \"Matches like today help. Some moments I was moving faster. Some moments not. I need to get used to that, to take that risk. ... I feel more ready to try it than before.\"\n\nDuring his 70th win in the Italian capital, the Campo Centrale crowd serenaded Nadal with chants of: \"Ole, Ole, Ole, Na-dal, Na-dal.\"\n\n\"I've always been emotional to play here, these kind of events are the most important events in my tennis career,\" Nadal said. \"The crowd has been always amazing with me, supporting me since the beginning of my tennis career. So I'm super excited to be able to play one more time here.\"\n\nNadal was coming off a straight-set loss to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open. But he has never lost consecutive matches on clay in his entire career and now that impressive statistic remains intact during what he has indicated is his final season on tour.\n\nNadal got out to a strong start, unleashing a 95 mph (153 kph) forehand winner en route to an early break and a 3-1 lead in the first set. But he gave the break right back in the next game when he missed three weak groundstrokes into the net.\n\nThen at 4-4, Nadal double-faulted twice and was broken again to give the 108th-ranked Bergs a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the set.\n\nIn the first set, Nadal committed 16 unforced errors to Bergs' 10.\n\nDuring the first game of the second set, the match was briefly suspended when a spectator in the stands required medical treatment. That allowed Nadal to chat with Carlos Moya, his coach.\n\nAfter the 10-minute suspension of play, Nadal raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set as he upped the power on his shots and became more aggressive.\n\nDuring the third set, Nadal managed to win a point after he fell to the red clay, quickly getting up to resume the rally and then producing a delicate drop-shot winner. Then he blasted a forehand cross-court winner to break for a 3-1 lead and unleashed a double-clutch fist pump.\n\nThere were more fist pumps when Nadal rallied from 0-40 on his serve to hold for a 4-2 lead in the third.\n\nNadal's mother and sister sitting behind the court shouted encouragement and his 1-year-old son was also court-side -- sitting on the lap of Nadal's father.\n\nThe Nadal family can now look forward to a second-round matchup with seventh-seeded Hubert Hurkacz. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic is on the opposite side of the draw, while second-ranked Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both withdrew because of injuries.\n\nIn other matches, Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic beat Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2; Thiago Seboth Wild defeated French qualifier Gregoire Barrere 6-4, 6-2; and Dominik Koepfer eliminated Andrea Vavassori 6-4, 6-3.\n\nTwo former top-ranked women eliminated seeded players.

Nadal was playing only his 10th match this year after missing nearly all of 2023 with a hip injury that required surgery. He's hoping to be competitive one last time at the French Open, where he is the record 14-time champion.\n\n\"That was not my best match. I was practicing better than how I played today, without a doubt. But I found a way to win,'' Nadal said. \"My game is more unpredictable than before. I didn't play much tennis for the last two years. So I'm up and down, on and off, but I think I can do it much better than what I did today.\" Rome, where he is a record 10-time champion, is Nadal's last big warmup tournament before Roland Garros starts on May 26.\n\nNadal noted that after overcoming his hip and abdominal issues, the time has come \"to prove myself if I am able to push my body to the limit that I need to push to feel myself ready for what's coming.'' \"I am not talking only about Roland Garros. I am talking about the next match. I need to lose this fear,\" Nadal said. \"Matches like today help. Some moments I was moving faster. Some moments not. I need to get used to that, to take that risk. ... I feel more ready to try it than before.\" During his 70th win in the Italian capital, the Campo Centrale crowd serenaded Nadal with chants of: \"Ole, Ole, Ole, Na-dal, Na-dal.\" \"I've always been emotional to play here, these kind of events are the most important events in my tennis career,'' Nadal said. ''The crowd has been always amazing with me, supporting me since the beginning of my tennis career. So I'm super excited to be able to play one more time here.\" Nadal was coming off a straight-set loss to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open. But he has never lost consecutive matches on clay in his entire career and now that impressive statistic remains intact during what he has indicated is his final season on tour.\n\nNadal got out to a strong start, unleashing a 95 mph (153 kph) forehand winner en route to an early break and a 3-1 lead in the first set. But he gave the break right back in the next game when he missed three weak groundstrokes into the net.\n\nThen at 4-4, Nadal double-faulted twice and was broken again to give the 108th-ranked Bergs a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the set.\n\nIn the first set, Nadal committed 16 unforced errors to Bergs' 10.\n\nDuring the first game of the second set, the match was briefly suspended when a spectator in the stands required medical treatment. That allowed Nadal to chat with Carlos Moya, his coach.\n\nAfter the 10-minute suspension of play, Nadal raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set as he upped the power on his shots and became more aggressive.\n\nDuring the third set, Nadal managed to win a point after he fell to the red clay, quickly getting up to resume the rally and then producing a delicate drop-shot winner. Then he blasted a forehand cross-court winner to break for a 3-1 lead and unleashed a double-clutch fist pump.\n\nThere were more fist pumps when Nadal rallied from 0-40 on his serve to hold for a 4-2 lead in the third.\n\nNadal's mother and sister sitting behind the court shouted encouragement and his 1-year-old son was also court-side -- sitting on the lap of Nadal's father.\n\nThe Nadal family can now look forward to a second-round matchup with seventh-seeded Hubert Hurkacz. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic is on the opposite side of the draw, while second-ranked Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both withdrew because of injuries.\n\nIn other matches, Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic beat Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2; Thiago Seboth Wild defeated French qualifier Gregoire Barrere 6-4, 6-2; and Dominik Koepfer eliminated Andrea Vavassori 6-4, 6-3.\n\nTwo former top-ranked women eliminated seeded players. Naomi Osaka beat 19th-seeded Marta Kostyuk 6-3, 6-2 in a match that was suspended for about an hour because of rain, and Angelique Kerber ousted 17th-seeded Veronika Kudermetova 6-3, 6-0.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Koepfer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Koepfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Vavassori", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Vavassori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronika_Kudermetova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veronika Kudermetova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Moy\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Moy\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelique_Kerber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angelique Kerber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr\u00e9goire_Barr\u00e8re", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gr\u00e9goire Barr\u00e8re"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Kostyuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marta Kostyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Popyrin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Popyrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_01_16_4088895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 1936, "textEnd": 1942}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He outmuscled Patrick Kypson in the first round, but couldn't make his mark against Ben Shelton in the second.\n\nBergs will enter the Italian Open on the back of a first-round exit in the Madrid Open. Despite a spirited effort against Luca Van Assche, he fell to the Frenchman in two hours and 53 minutes, 6-4, 6-7(0), 6-1.\n\nViewers in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and India can watch the top seed's match against Etcheverry live on the following channels and sites:", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aman_mohamed@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Aman Mohamed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shelton_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shelton (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Van_Assche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luca Van Assche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Kypson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Kypson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee_Tennis_Challenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee Tennis Challenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Challenger Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boomerang/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/bbf71-17151357883316-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It's the 81st edition one of the most prestigious tournaments on the calendar, and with 1000 ATP Tour Masters points up for grabs, one veteran is returning to a tournament he has dominated over the years.\n\nNovak Djokovic may be the top seed and Daniil Medvedev the defending champion after beating Holger Rune in last year's final, but record-breaking 10-time winner Rafael Nadal is back and begins in the first round, looking to claim an 11th crown and leave his mark on this tournament for possibly the final time.\n\nAlthough he enters the 2024 Italian Open ranked a lowly 305th in the world, Nadal will be confident of progressing deep into one of his statement tournaments, particularly with Spanish compatriot Carlos Alcaraz out injured.\n\nLike with last week's Madrid Open, Nadal and Canadian Denis Shapovalov will enter this year's event with a protected ranking, restricted for competitors who have recently spent time out due to injury. And, you can follow his progress throughout the tournament alongside The Sporting News.\n\nMORE: Who is the world No.1 in men's tennis? Updated ATP rankings\n\nFirst up for Nadal at this year's tournament is 24-year-old Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs, whom he'll take on in the Round of 128, and should he get past Bergs in the first round, Nadal faces a tough test against his next opponent: seventh seed and world number eight Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nHe is scheduled to play Bergs in his first-round match on Thursday, May 9.\n\nTomas Martin Etcheverry could be the Spaniard's next challenger in the third round should he defeat Hurkacz, while 2023 finalist Holger Rune, unfortunately for Nadal, is also on this side of the draw.\n\nNadal faces Bergs at the Foro Italico on Thursday, May 9 2024, and although the full rundown and schedule for day two of this year's tournament is yet to be released.\n\nAs one of the poster boys for Spanish tennis, Nadal's first round match will be one of the most anticipated clashes at this stage of this year's Italian Open, and as such there's plenty of coverage confirmed.\n\nHere's a look at the following TV channels and live streams in the major territories:\n\nIf the Italian Open is not available to watch live in your location or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

The 37-year-old has only ever lost twice in a Rome decider, in 2011 and 2014 -- both to this year's top seed and favourite Novak Djokovic.\n\nThe Spaniard has won back-to-back Italian Open titles on three occasions, in 2009/10, 2012/13 and 2018/19, while his first Rome win back in 2005 began a three-year period of dominance as he collected the title in both 2006 and 2007 too.

He\u00b4s hoping to be competitive one last time at the French Open, where he is the record 14-time champion. Rome, where he is a record 10-time champion, is his last big warmup tournament before Roland Garros starts on May 26.\n\nNadal was coming off a straight-set loss to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open. But he has never lost consecutive matches on clay in his entire career and now that impressive statistic remains intact during what he has indicated is his final season on tour.\n\nNadal got out to a strong start, unleashing a 95 mph (153 kph) forehand winner en route to an early break and a 3-1 lead in the first set. But he gave the break right back in the next game when he missed three weak groundstrokes into the net.\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal returns the ball to Belgium's Zizou Bergs at the Italian Open tennis tournament, in Rome, Thursday, May 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)\n\nThen at 4-4, Nadal double-faulted twice and was broken again to give the 108th-ranked Bergs a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the set.\n\nIn the first set, Nadal committed 16 unforced errors to Bergs\u00b4 10.\n\nDuring the first game of the second set, the match was briefly suspended when a spectator in the stands required medical treatment. That allowed Nadal to chat with Carlos Moya, his coach.\n\nAfter the 10-minute suspension of play, Nadal raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set as he upped the power on his shots and became more aggressive.\n\nMore than once, the Campo Centrale crowd serenaded Nadal with a chant of: \"Ole, Ole, Ole, Na-dal, Na-dal.\"\n\nDuring the third set, Nadal managed to win a point after he fell to the red clay, quickly getting up to resume the rally and then producing a delicate drop-shot winner. Then he blasted a forehand cross-court winner to break for a 3-1 lead and unleashed a double-clutch fist pump.\n\nThere were more fist pumps when Nadal rallied from 0-40 on his serve to hold for a 4-2 lead in the third.\n\nNadal\u00b4s mother and sister sitting behind the court shouted encouragement and his 1-year-old son was also court-side - sitting on the lap of Nadal\u00b4s father.\n\nThe Nadal family can now look forward to a second-round matchup with seventh-seeded Hubert Hurkacz. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic is on the opposite side of the draw, while second-ranked Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both withdrew because of injuries.\n\nIn other matches, Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic beat Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2; Thiago Seboth Wild defeated French qualifier Gregoire Barrere 6-4, 6-2; and Dominik Koepfer eliminated Andrea Vavassori 6-4, 6-3.\n\nIn women\u00b4s play, former No. 1 Angelique Kerber ousted 17th-seeded Veronika Kudermetova 6-3, 6-0.\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal wipes his forehead as plays against Belgium's Zizou Bergs at the Italian Open tennis tournament, in Rome, Thursday, May 9, 2024.

He won three matches in a row for the first time since the 2022 US Open at the recent Madrid Masters.\n\nREAD MORE: The 6 men to beat Rafael Nadal at the Italian Open with Novak Djokovic only man to achieve feat more than once\n\nIn his pre-tournament press conference in Rome, Nadal was asked what his emotions would be going into this year's French Open.\n\n\"I can't have a clear answer. First of all, I want to play Rome. That's the tournament that I am today,\" said the Spaniard.\n\n\"I don't think after that. If after that I feel ready to play Roland Garros, I cannot predict what kind of emotions I going to have there.\n\n\"I just want to enjoy every day. I am enjoying playing tennis, by the way. Always depending on my body how far I can keep going in terms of timings, no?\n\n\"I am happy doing what I'm doing. When I'm talking about retirement, [it] is not because I'm not happy anymore playing tennis or I'm not feeling myself competitive enough.\n\n\"That's not the case. It's about the body was not able to play weeks in a row, was not able to allow me practise and enjoy the practices in a daily basis. Then arrive a moment that don't make sense.\n\n\"If you're not able to do the things the proper way in your daily basis, you are not able to enjoy because of the pain and the injuries in your daily basis, it's almost impossible to have success or to keep fighting for the things that really motivate me, no?\n\n\"But now is my third week on the tour almost in a row, so... It's a good moment, even if the results are not what used to be. But I am increasing my feeling, my level. Let's see. I want to keep going.\"\n\nThe former world No 1 also gave his evaluation of his improvement in terms of tennis and fitness since making his return to action in Barcelona last month.\n\n\"Well, it's something that is not every day the same. Is not a line like this (steadily up), it's a little bit like this (up and down). Even after Barcelona, I had some tough moments in Madrid. Even here the first day,\" Nadal explained.\n\n\"But in a general perspective, the line is going up, without a doubt. So yeah, I mean, happy to be today where I am. because one month ago, for me was almost impossible to think that I will be able to play in Barcelona, then in Madrid, and now being here in Rome.\n\n\"Things are happening. [It] is true that I was able to accept the challenge, accept that some moments I was not able to push the way that I wanted to push.\n\n\"Doing the things the proper way and trying to avoid a lot of risks in terms of pushing a lot on the matches, I was able to keep moving. Madrid was a good test for me playing I think two days in a row, one match over three hours.\n\n\"My feelings are better always. In terms of tennis, too. Why not? I am here to try my best. Tomorrow is a start. All the matches are tough for me today and difficult and more unpredictable than what the matches used to be for me, especially on clay.\n\n\"I accept that role.

Whether it's talking [about] that he's too old, he's not what it used to be, this is like the old mayor,\" Connors said on the Advantage Connors podcast.\n\n\"The way he always approached his matches and went out there, he was all business. And the attitude that he had and the grit and the grind, never let a ball. Run down everything. You know, [he would] kill himself. And leave his DNA out there. And he's loved plenty of that all around the world, so...\n\n\"Ultimately, it's his decision (to retire). And eventually, we all get it. Everybody gets it, and then you have so many other things to do the rest of your life that you just fold into that.\"\n\nLast week, Nadal concluded what was believed to be his last Madrid Masters participation. But before his campaign at Caja Magica ended in the round-of-16, Nadal issued a telling statement that answered why playing beyond 2025 is probably impossible.\n\nDuring Nadal's 6-1 6-0 Madrid first-round win over Darwin Blanch, the Madrid crowd also had a chance to see the Spaniard's sitting in the box. After the match, 37-year-old Nadal said he would like to keep playing so his son - who was born in 2022 October - could remember him playing. But then, Nadal acknowledged that his body very likely won't make that happen.\n\n\"I would love to play a little bit longer and give him (my son) a memory of myself playing tennis. That's what will be the ideal thing for me and for my wife and family. But I can't, probably I will not be able to make that happen,\" Nadal confessed after starting his Madrid Open campaign with a win.\n\n\"But at least, I mean, happy to have a great team and family and friends around me almost all my life. It helped me in every single way of being happy.\"\n\nWhile Nadal didn't win Madrid, winning three matches before losing to Jiri Lehecka in the round-of-16 was still a solid result. After the loss to Lehecka, Nadal stayed on the court for a mini-ceremony as he addressed the crowd and said goodbye in emotional scenes.\n\nNow, Nadal is set to play in Rome, where he famously won titles in each of his first three appearances between 2005 and 2007. Since then, Nadal has won seven more titles at Foro Italico and now he is a record 10-time Rome champion.\n\n\"That's another very special tournament in my career. I dreamed to play all these tournaments that I had success one more time. I missed Monte Carlo unfortunately, that is one of the most special for me, but Rome is one of these ones that I enjoyed a lot playing there,\" Nadal noted.\n\nOn Monday, Nadal learned that he will be taking on a qualifier in the Rome first round. If Nadal makes it past a qualifier, he will then be having a tough test in the second round since his opponent will be world No. 9 Hubert Hurkacz.\n\n\"I want to play well there (in Rome). I want to be competitive. I want to give myself a chance to play good tennis, and I'm gonna keep working hard to try to make that happen,\" Nadal said in Madrid when addressing his hopes for Rome.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Connors", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Connors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caja_M\u00e1gica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caja M\u00e1gica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148470.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

A Novak Djokovic superfan, Pavvy G's contempt towards Rafael Nadal is no secret. However, only of late, with Rafael Nadal's career nearing its end, he has praised the Spaniard on certain occasions.\n\nRafael Nadal is gearing up for the Italian Open 2024, which is set to be his last tournament in Rome. With that, Pavvy G shared a few posts celebrating the legend.\n\n\"I dislike Nadal for many reasons, but I hugely respect him for the greatest player to ever play on clay and I respect the fact that he's seems a hands on, doting and a great Dad. I love seeing pictures of him with his son and amazing his son still has a chance to see him play,\" wrote Pavvy G on X.\n\nOver the years, Pavvy G has slammed Rafael Nadal and his fans while defending Novak Djokovic always. However, he does find the 22-time Grand Slam champion's achievements on clay superior to not just Djokovic, but other players too.\n\nNadal being a private person who is a bonafide family man, seems to have impressed the Nolefam veteran as the Spaniard has been seen bringing his son to watch his matches or practice sessions off late. Pavvy G tweeted recently about this and other Nolefam members surprisingly agreed with him -\n\n\"I love the fact that Baby Rafa clearly loves watching his Daddy play! Must give Rafa so much joy and inspiration to have his son watch him play.\"\n\nHe also proudly shared an incredible record of Rafael Nadal, which has remained intact since 2003. This shows that one can be passionate about their favorite players and yet, respect their rivals wherever it is appropriate.\n\nThe schedule for the Italian Open 2024 is out, and tennis fans are going crazy over one prospect over anything else - a potential clash between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Djokovic and Nadal are playing in the same tournament for the first time in 16 months. The last time they played in the same event was at the Australian Open 2023.\n\nWorld No.1 Djokovic will start as the top seed but isn't in the same half as Nadal. But if they do meet, it could be the last time the two legends of the game will play against each other.\n\nAt the Italian Open, Nadal and Djokovic met 9 times, a huge number considering that they have played 59 matches against each other. Nadal leads by 6-3 in this tournament, showing his prowess on clay. Their most recent encounter in this ATP Masters event was in 2021, which was also one of their fiercest matches. Nadal won 7-5, 1-6, 6-3 in the end.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanmay_roy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tanmay Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/12/579841f5-untitled-design-97.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He's hoping to be competitive one last time at the French Open, where he is the record 14-time champion. Rome, where he is a record 10-time champion, is his last big warmup tournament before Roland Garros starts on May 26.\n\nNadal was coming off a straight-set loss to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open. But he has never lost consecutive matches on clay in his entire career and now that impressive statistic remains intact during what he has indicated is his final season on tour.\n\nNadal got out to a strong start, unleashing a 95 mph (153 kph) forehand winner en route to an early break and a 3-1 lead in the first set. But he gave the break right back in the next game when he missed three weak groundstrokes into the net.\n\nThen at 4-4, Nadal double-faulted twice and was broken again to give the 108th-ranked Bergs a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the set.\n\nIn the first set, Nadal committed 16 unforced errors to Bergs' 10.\n\nDuring the first game of the second set, the match was briefly suspended when a spectator in the stands required medical treatment. That allowed Nadal to chat with Carlos Moya, his coach.\n\nAfter the 10-minute suspension of play, Nadal raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set as he upped the power on his shots and became more aggressive.\n\nMore than once, the Campo Centrale crowd serenaded Nadal with a chant of: \"Ole, Ole, Ole, Na-dal, Na-dal.\"\n\nDuring the third set, Nadal managed to win a point after he fell to the red clay, quickly getting up to resume the rally and then producing a delicate drop-shot winner. Then he blasted a forehand cross-court winner to break for a 3-1 lead and unleashed a double-clutch fist pump.\n\nThere were more fist pumps when Nadal rallied from 0-40 on his serve to hold for a 4-2 lead in the third.\n\nNadal's mother and sister sitting behind the court shouted encouragement and his 1-year-old son was also courtside -- sitting on the lap of Nadal's father.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@espn.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Moy\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Moy\u00e1"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0509%2Fr1330570_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 985, "textEnd": 991}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Things are happening.\n\n\"All the matches are tough for me today and difficult and more unpredictable than what the matches used to be for me, especially on clay,\" Nadal added. \"I accept that role. I accept that challenge.

I don't think after that,\" said Nadal, who had his 1-year-old son courtside for his practice sessions at the Foro Italico this week.\n\nNadal's opening match in Rome is scheduled for Thursday against Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs, who is ranked No. 108.\n\nTop-ranked Novak Djokovic, who is also back in Rome after a month out, is on the opposite half of the draw from Nadal. But second-ranked Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both withdrew because of injuries.\n\nDjokovic hasn't played for nearly a month -- since he lost to Casper Ruud in the Monte Carlo Masters semifinals. He's also without a title this year -- the first time he's reached May without a trophy since 2018 when he was returning from a right elbow injury.\n\nBut the 36-year-old Serb was optimistic about his chances of defending his French Open title.\n\n\"I think I'm on a good route to peak at Roland Garros in Paris,\" Djokovic said. \"Hopefully here in Rome I can play better than I did in Monte Carlo.\"\n\nDjokovic added that his withdrawal from the Madrid Open wasn't because of physical issues.\n\n\"It was not part of the schedule,\" he said. \"The plan was to come here. That's basically it.\"\n\nNadal has won the Italian Open a record 10 times and he rated his first two titles at the Foro Italico as his most memorable: five-set victories over Guillermo Coria and Roger Federer in 2005 and 2006, respectively.\n\nStarting in 2007, the Rome final was switched to a best of-three sets format.\n\n\"Most of (the) important moments of tennis have been playing in matches best-of five because at the end of the day that makes the matches more emotional, more dramatic, the people get more involved,\" Nadal said. \"Those amazing battles that are part of the history of our sport.\n\n\"It's true that I won 10 times here. But if you tell me my memories, for me I'm much more fresh the memories of the first two victories in five sets against Coria and against Roger than the other (titles). Even if I had amazing, good matches against Novak, against great players,\" Nadal added. \"But that's what I think the people remember more.\"\n\nTags Sports Tennis Games And Toys Be the first to

He's hoping to be competitive one last time at the French Open, where he is the record 14-time champion. Rome, where he is a record 10-time champion, is his last big warmup tournament before Roland Garros starts on May 26.\n\nNadal was coming off a straight-set loss to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open. But he has never lost consecutive matches on clay in his entire career and now that impressive statistic remains intact during what he has indicated is his final season on tour.\n\nNadal got out to a strong start, unleashing a 95 mph (153 kph) forehand winner en route to an early break and a 3-1 lead in the first set. But he gave the break right back in the next game when he missed three weak groundstrokes into the net.\n\nThen at 4-4, Nadal double-faulted twice and was broken again to give the 108th-ranked Bergs a 5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the set.\n\nIn the first set, Nadal committed 16 unforced errors to Bergs' 10.\n\nDuring the first game of the second set, the match was briefly suspended when a spectator in the stands required medical treatment. That allowed Nadal to chat with Carlos Moya, his coach.\n\nAfter the 10-minute suspension of play, Nadal raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set as he upped the power on his shots and became more aggressive.\n\nMore than once, the Campo Centrale crowd serenaded Nadal with a chant of: \"Ole, Ole, Ole, Na-dal, Na-dal.\"\n\nDuring the third set, Nadal managed to win a point after he fell to the red clay, quickly getting up to resume the rally and then producing a delicate drop-shot winner. Then he blasted a forehand cross-court winner to break for a 3-1 lead and unleashed a double-clutch fist pump.\n\nThere were more fist pumps when Nadal rallied from 0-40 on his serve to hold for a 4-2 lead in the third.\n\nNadal's mother and sister sitting behind the court shouted encouragement and his 1-year-old son was also court-side -- sitting on the lap of Nadal's father.\n\nThe Nadal family can now look forward to a second-round matchup with seventh-seeded Hubert Hurkacz. Top-ranked Novak Djokovic is on the opposite side of the draw, while second-ranked Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both withdrew because of injuries.\n\nIn other matches, Serbian qualifier Hamad Medjedovic beat Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2; Thiago Seboth Wild defeated French qualifier Gregoire Barrere 6-4, 6-2; and Dominik Koepfer eliminated Andrea Vavassori 6-4, 6-3.\n\nIn women's play, former No. 1 Angelique Kerber ousted 17th-seeded Veronika Kudermetova 6-3, 6-0.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

So I'm super excited to be able to play one more time here.\"\n\nNadal was coming off a straight-set loss to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round of the Madrid Open.\n\nBut he has never lost consecutive matches on clay in his entire career and now that impressive statistic remains intact during what he has indicated is his final season on tour.\n\nNadal's mother and sister sitting behind the court shouted encouragement and his one-year-old son was also courtside, sitting on the lap of Nadal's father.\n\nThe Nadal family can now look forward to a second-round match-up with seventh-seeded Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nTop-ranked Novak Djokovic is on the opposite side of the draw, while second-ranked Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both withdrew because of injuries.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-14611820/a8e777fb94a51c667fc130c84151178314371407-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 1437, "textEnd": 1443}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

By ATP Staff\n\nRafael Nadal continues his comeback this week at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, an ATP Masters 1000 event he has won a record 10 times. The Spaniard returned from injury last month in Barcelona before he played in Madrid, advancing to the fourth round.\n\nNadal lost to Jiri Lehecka in the Spanish capital last Tuesday. The 37-year-old then returned home before he arrived in the Italian capital at the weekend.\n\n\"I have been a few days at home, then arrived here on Saturday,\" Nadal said in his pre-tournament press conference on Wednesday. \"I was able more or less to practice well the past few days. I'm excited to be playing in Rome. It's a tournament that brings me back to a lot of unforgettable memories. My third week almost in a row on the Tour, third tournament in a row. That didn't happen since a super long time ago. That's good news.\"\n\nPleased with his recent progress, Nadal believes patience is key in Rome, where he will start against Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs on Thursday.\n\n\"It's something that is not every day the same. Is not a line like this [going up], it's a little bit like this [up and down],\" Nadal said. \"Even after Barcelona, I had some tough moments in Madrid. Even here the first day. But in a general perspective, the line is going up, without a doubt. I am happy to be today where I am because one month ago for me [it] was almost impossible to think that I would be able to play in Barcelona then in Madrid and now being here in Rome. Things are happening.\n\n\"It is true that I was able to accept the challenge, accept that some moments I was not able to push the way that I wanted to push. Doing things the proper way and trying to avoid a lot of risks in terms of pushing a lot on the matches, I was able to keep moving. Madrid was a good test for me playing I think two days in a row, one match over three hours. My feelings are better always. In terms of tennis, too. Why not? I am here to try my best.\"\n\nNadal holds a 69-8 record in the Foro Italico, lifting his first trophy at the ATP Masters 1000 event on debut in 2005. The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated Guillermo Coria in a five-set epic final in 2005, while he clawed past Roger Federer in a deciding set in the 2006 championship match.\n\nAhead of his potential last appearance in Rome, the 92-time tour-level titlist reflected fondly on both of those matches.\n\n\"It is always a great feeling [to] be playing here. The crowd here is very passionate. Amazing matches with Coria, with Roger the first two times I played here,\" Nadal said. \"Then I was able to achieve that tournament a lot of times. It is a tournament that is part of the history of our sport. It is a very traditional, important tournament in our Tour. I'm excited and feel lucky to be playing here again at this stage of my career. I am motivated for tomorrow and for the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Coria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guillermo Coria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/05/08/12/53/nadal-rome-2024-preview.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The final itself didn't live up to expectations as Djokovic won 6-4, 6-4 for his 39th consecutive win on the ATP Tour as he took his unbeaten streak in 2011 to 37-0.\n\nNadal turned the tables on Djokovic the next year as he won the final before he defeated Roger Federer in the 2013 final, but Djokovic again proved to be his nemesis in 2014 with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory.\n\nDjokovic's third win over Nadal in Rome came in 2016 as he defeated his great Spanish rival 7-5, 7-6 (7-4) in the quarter-final.\n\nFormer world No 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero was the first man to get the better of Nadal in Italy as he defeated his fellow Spaniard in the second round.\n\nNadal started the 2008 tournament with a 17-0 record as he was the three-time defending champion. In fact, he was 105-1 in matches on clay before the tournament, but went down 7-5, 6-1 against Ferrero.\n\nAfter losing the 2014 final to Djokovic, Nadal's \"lean period\" in Rome continued the following year as Stan Wawrinka became only the third player to beat him at Foro Italico.\n\nWawrinka won 7-6 (9-7), 6-2 as Nadal lost his fifth match on clay that year. It was a precursor of what was to come at Roland Garros as Nadal was beaten in straight sets by Djokovic in the quarter-final before the Serbian went down in four sets in the final against Wawrinka.\n\nNadal's struggles at Rome continued as he went four years without a title with Dominic Thiem joining the exclusive club of players to defeat him at the event.\n\nSeeded eighth, Thiem defeated his esteemed rival 6-4, 6-3 in the quarter-final before losing against Djokovic in the next match. The defeat was a surprise as Nadal had won all 17 of his matches on clay before losing against Thiem. The Spaniard, though, did go on to win the French Open a few weeks later.\n\nAfter winning the 2018 and 2019 titles, Nadal was denied another hat-trick as Argentine Diego Schwartzman stunned him in the quarter-final in Rome as the Argentine won his first match against the Spaniard in 10 attempts.\n\n\"For sure it's my best match ever,\" Schwartzman said after his 6-2, 7-5 victory. \"I played a few times against the three big champions in tennis. I never beat them until today. I'm very happy.\"\n\nCanadian Denis Shapovalov is the last man to beat Rafael Nadal at the Italian Open as he claimed a 1-6, 7-5, 6-2 win over the Spaniard in the third round in 2021.\n\nNadal struggled with a rib injury during the tournament and there were major doubts over his French Open participation, but he played at the clay-court major and went on to be teh last man standing as he won his 14th title at Roland Garros.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shahida_jacobs@tennis365.com", "name": "Shahida Jacobs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Carlos_Ferrero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Carlos Ferrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stan Wawrinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Thiem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Thiem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Shapovalov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denis Shapovalov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Schwartzman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diego Schwartzman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2024/05/08140956/Sweat-dripping-from-Rafael-Nadals-face.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

But I'll have to improve a lot if I'm going to win the next match and I expect to do so.\"\n\nSpaniard Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.\n\nThe 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.\n\nHe returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.\n\nNadal has said that he will only play at the French Open, where he has won 14 times, if he feels competitive and although he showed glimpses of his old self against 108th-ranked Bergs he struggled on his serve and looked a long way from Grand Slam standard.\n\nBattling Nadal\n\nOutsider Bergs, 24, is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour and had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Rune.\n\nThe hard-hitting Belgian pushed his big-name rival all the way, briefly looking like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take victory.\n\nNadal showed signs of form in game four of the first set, when a stunning passing shot and brilliant return of serve in consecutive points took him to 0-40 and an eventual break.\n\nBut Bergs broke back straight away as Nadal's rustiness from his long layoff showed, a super return of serve pulling the Belgian to within a game before he levelled at 3-3 with his serve.\n\nAnd Nadal dropped his serve for a second time as errors began to creep in to his game, a double fault at 15-40 down in game nine handing Bergs the chance to claim the set in the next, which he duly took to love.\n\nNadal came out all guns blazing in the second set however, quickly racing to a 3-0 lead after the first game was interrupted for 10 minutes at 40-0 due to a spectator illness.\n\nHe battled against a spirited Bergs to hold his next three service games and level the match before breaking out some vintage shots to break Bergs three games later and take firm control.\n\nNadal then saved three break points in a row to move 4-2 ahead and served out to win, sealing the deal with his first match point.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news",

But a shape that the 22-time Grand Slam champion is starting to feel good about as he prepares to play what will likely be his final French Open.\n\n\"It's a good moment, even if the results are not what (they) used to be,\" Nadal said at the Italian Open on Wednesday. \"But I am increasing my feeling, my level. ... I want to keep going.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old Nadal, who has indicated that this will be his final year on tour, has played only nine matches this year after missing nearly all of 2023 due to a hip injury that required surgery.\n\nBut he's coming off his most encouraging performance of the year, having put together three straight wins at the Madrid Open last week before losing in straight sets to 31st-ranked Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Things are happening.\n\n\"All the matches are tough for me today and difficult and more unpredictable than what the matches used to be for me, especially on clay,\" Nadal added. \"I accept that role. I accept that challenge. I am excited about the way that I can be able to play if I keep working the proper way and my body allows me.\"\n\nNadal is hoping to be competitive one last time at Roland Garros, where he is the record 14-time champion. Rome is his last big warmup tournament before the clay-court Grand Slam starts on May 26.\n\n\"First of all, I want to play Rome. That's the tournament that I am (at) today. I don't think after that,\" said Nadal, who had his 1-year-old son courtside for his practice sessions at the Foro Italico this week.\n\nNadal's opening match in Rome is scheduled for Thursday against Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs, who is ranked No. 108.\n\nTop-ranked Novak Djokovic, who is also back in Rome after a month out, is on the opposite half of the draw from Nadal. But second-ranked Jannik Sinner and third-ranked Carlos Alcaraz both withdrew because of injuries.\n\nDjokovic hasn't played for nearly a month -- since he lost to Casper Ruud in the Monte Carlo Masters semifinals. He's also without a title this year -- the first time he's reached May without a trophy since 2018 when he was returning from a right elbow injury.\n\nBut the 36-year-old Serb was optimistic about his chances of defending his French Open title.\n\n\"I think I'm on a good route to peak at Roland Garros in Paris,\" Djokovic said. \"Hopefully here in Rome I can play better than I did in Monte Carlo.\"\n\nDjokovic added that his withdrawal from the Madrid Open wasn't because of physical issues.\n\n\"It was not part of the schedule,\" he said. \"The plan was to come here. That's basically it.\"\n\nNadal has won the Italian Open a record 10 times and he rated his first two titles at the Foro Italico as his most memorable: five-set victories over Guillermo Coria and Roger Federer in 2005 and 2006, respectively.\n\nStarting in 2007, the Rome final was switched to a best-of-three sets format.\n\n\"Most of (the) important moments of tennis have been playing in matches best-of-five because at the end of the day that makes the matches more emotional, more dramatic, the people get more involved,\" Nadal said. \"Those amazing battles that are part of the history of our sport.\n\n\"It's true that I won 10 times here. But if you tell me my memories, for me I'm much more fresh the memories of the first two victories in five sets against Coria and against Roger than the other (titles). Even if I had amazing, good matches against Novak, against great players,\" Nadal added. \"But that's what I think the people remember more.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

clay surface as he builds up to what is expected to be his final appearance at the French Open later this month.\n\n\"My game is more unpredictable than before, I haven't played much tennis for two years but I think I can do better than that,\" Nadal added.\n\nHaving made his return from a three-month injury absence at the Barcelona Open in April, Nadal reached the last 16 of the Madrid Open last week before falling to Czech player Jiri Lehecka.\n\nIn Italy, Nadal got off to a tough start on the surface he has so long favoured.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion broke for 3-1 in the opening set but Bergs, ranked 108 in the world, immediately cancelled out the advantage before a double fault gifted the 24-year-old the break and he served out the set.\n\nBut, after a medical emergency in the crowd halted play one game into the second set, Nadal looked much more comfortable.\n\nHe quickly raced to a 3-0 lead and this time kept his composure, unleashing a forehand winner and fist pumping towards the crowd as he levelled the match.\n\nNadal once again broke early in the third set before overturning a 40-0 deficit and saving three break points to move 4-2 ahead.\n\nA powerful forehand winner eventually secured the win and booked Nadal's place in the second round, where he will face Polish world number nine Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nBritish duo Dan Evans and Jack Draper

But I'll have to improve a lot if I'm going to win the next match and I expect to do so.\"\n\nSpaniard Nadal has in recent times been a shadow of the player who has won 22 Grand Slams in a storied career which has also brought a record 10 titles in Rome, his most recent in 2021.\n\nThe 37-year-old has struggled with injury, dropping down to 305 in the world rankings after missing almost all of last year.\n\nHe returned in April from another three-month lay-off with a second-round exit in Barcelona before reaching the last 16 in Madrid last week.\n\nNadal has said that he will only play at the French Open, where he has won 14 times, if he feels competitive and although he showed glimpses of his old self against 108th-ranked Bergs he struggled on his serve and looked a long way from Grand Slam standard.\n\n- Battling Nadal -\n\nOutsider Bergs, 24, is an eight-time title winner on the Challenger tour and had in previous tournaments taken sets off high-profile players like Stefanos Tsitsipas and last year's losing Rome finalist Rune.\n\nThe hard-hitting Belgian pushed his big-name rival all the way, briefly looking like he might win the biggest match of his career to date before Nadal fought back to take victory.\n\nNadal showed signs of form in game four of the first set, when a stunning passing shot and brilliant return of serve in consecutive points took him to 0-40 and an eventual break.\n\nBut Bergs broke back straight away as Nadal's rustiness from his long layoff showed, a super return of serve pulling the Belgian to within a game before he levelled at 3-3 with his serve.\n\nAnd Nadal dropped his serve for a second time as errors began to creep in to his game, a double fault at 15-40 down in game nine handing Bergs the chance to claim the set in the next, which he duly took to love.\n\nNadal came out all guns blazing in the second set however, quickly racing to a 3-0 lead after the first game was interrupted for 10 minutes at 40-0 due to a spectator

By ATP Staff\n\nIt is no secret that Rafael Nadal in recent times has dealt with physical challenges, from arthroscopic left hip surgery last year to a micro tear in a muscle this year in Australia. Since his return to action in Barcelona, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has battled hard, but has not yet appeared in the form that helped him win 92 tour-level titles, perhaps protecting his body.\n\nBut after a tight three-set win against Zizou Bergs Thursday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the Spaniard said it is time to let go and try firing on all cylinders.\n\n\"I need to try to play at my hundred per cent. It's not easy because I need to lose a little bit of fear that I have in some shots because, for example, in Brisbane I got a tear on the place that I had the surgery last year,\" Nadal said. \"Sometimes important surgery like I had, I had to remove an important part of my psoas tendon, [make] a lot of muscles around work more than before. It's about having the right time to adapt all these muscles to this new configuration of the hip. But I don't have that much time. That's the problem and that's the truth.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old explained that he hoped to make enough progress to play at his 100 per cent in Monte-Carlo, but his abdominal injury prevented him from being ready to compete at all.\n\n\"I did this progress the past three weeks on the Tour. But the moment [has arrived] that I need to try, I need to go for everything. If something happens, something happens. That's the truth,\" Nadal said. \"It's not like in Madrid, it's not like in Barcelona, especially that I need to analyse how things are improving, to explore if I am able to adapt all these things to the new weeks. But that's over and we are in Rome.\n\n\"I have Roland Garros in just two weeks and a half, so... a moment [has arrived] that I need to prove to myself if I am able to push my body to the limit that I need to push to feel myself ready for what's coming.\"\n\nAs Nadal later put it, \"I need to lose this fear\", starting with his next match against seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz. He recalled against Bergs moments in which he moved faster and others when he did not.\n\n\"I need to get used to that, to take that risk,\" Nadal said. \"If something wrong happens, we're going to accept it. But that's the moment to push. I feel more ready to try it than before.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Nadal has openly discussed the ups and downs of his level and how it is not as consistent as it was during his best years. He added that a match like the one he played Thursday helps.\n\n\"I felt myself before the match ready to play at the good level of tennis because I am feeling the ball much better on the practice sessions than what I felt in Barcelona and in Madrid,\" Nadal said. \"I feel myself closer to showing something probably much more positive that what I showed... today. Then I need to do it. That's a different story.\n\n\"I feel myself closer. That's why I was on the court even without playing well but telling myself I need to go through and explore the options that I can do much better the next day because my feelings on practice are much better than what I had, the level I showed today on court.\"\n\nNadal admitted he might not play his best on Saturday against Hurkacz, one of the biggest servers on the ATP Tour. But that does not change his mindset.\n\n\"I hope to be able to play much better than today, to start thinking another way,\" Nadal said. \"Let's see. I mean, I am excited with the victory. That's given me the chance to keep going. I am very happy for that.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/05/09/18/32/nadal-rome-2024-thursday-fist-pump.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Bergs then had four break points when 4-2 down, but lost his chance to get back into the match and Nadal finished off the job.\n\nAfter spending most of last year out with a hip injury, his return in January was cut short after a muscle tear in Brisbane, but last month he reached the second round in Barcelona and the fourth round in Madrid, as he builds up to the French Open.\n\n\"My game is more unpredictable than before, I didn't play much tennis for the last two years so have had some ups and downs, on and off, but I think I can do much better than today and I hope to do it next round,\" Nadal said.\n\nNadal's second round tie with Hurkacz will be his first match against the Polish 27-year-old.\n\nTop form\n\nNovak Djokovic said he is building up to hit top form for his French Open title defence, after the world No 1 skipped last month's Madrid Masters and arrived early in Rome to continue his preparations for the year's second Grand Slam.\n\nThe Serb last competed at the Monte Carlo Masters in April where he lost to Casper Ruud in the semi-finals, and the record 24-times Grand Slam champion is still seeking his first trophy of the season.\n\nThe 37-year-old, who has split with long-time coach Goran Ivanisevic, is currently working with former doubles world No 1 Nenad Zimonjic and said he was happy with his progress ahead of Roland Garros starting on May 26.\n\n\"I had plenty of time to also rest and train. I had a good training block. I arrived (in Rome) two days ago to get a hit on the centre court, obviously stay four-five days training before my first match with top players,\" Djokovic told reporters.\n\nGood route\n\n\"Obviously it's different when you train with them, playing practice sets, seeing where your game is at and working your way towards the fine form for the first official match.\n\n\"I think I'm on a good route to peak at Roland Garros in Paris. Hopefully here in Rome I can play better than I did in Monte Carlo.\" Djokovic also parted ways with fitness coach Marco Panichi and said he had rehired Gebhard Gritsch as he targets success in the Grand Slams and the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"We know each other really well. That's why I feel we're synchronised from the very beginning in terms of what we want to do, how we want to approach the programme of training on and off the court. With Nenad as well,\" Djokovic added.\n\n\"I'm pleased with the way the last 10-14 days went in terms of training, in terms of preparation and looking ahead to this tournament, but particularly Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the Olympic Games.\"", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@gulfnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebhard_Gritsch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gebhard Gritsch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goran_Ivani\u0161evi\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenad_Zimonji\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nenad Zimonji\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte-Carlo Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2024/05/09/Copy-of-142457-01-02-1715270813545_18f5e1b87ae_medium.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 2425, "textEnd": 2431}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

That's the feeling I have on my practice sessions.\n\n\"Of course, improvement, it's important because the biggest improvement is that I still playing. That's the biggest thing and the most important thing for me.\n\n\"In Barcelona, I was not sure if I was able to keep going. I am serving much better than in Barcelona. I improved that. I feel myself quicker. Sometimes I am playing too far from the baseline. That's something that I want to do it better, and I hope to do it better.\n\n\"That's it. I really believe that I need to organise my position a little bit better on the court than what I did today.

Despite losing the first set, the Spaniard bounced back with a characteristic display of determination to seal the match 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in his favor and secure passage to the next round.\n\nAt his press conference afterward, the former World No. 1 spoke about his display on the night as well as his readiness for the upcoming French Open. Nadal opined that it is time for him to test his body in the coming days, especially to see if he can push it to the limit and find out whether he can handle the rigors of the game at the highest level.\n\nThe Mallorcan admitted that there were some moments during his win over Bergs that he was holding himself back, adding that it is a fear he needs to lose if he wants to go toe-to-toe against the best at Roland Garros and in Rome this fortnight.\n\n\"I have Roland Garros in just two weeks and a half, so... Arrive a moment that I need to prove myself if I am able to push my body to the limit that I need to push to feel myself ready for what's coming. I am not talking only about Roland Garros.

I need to get used to that, to take that risk. It's a moment to me that happen. If something wrong happens, we going to accept it. But that's the moment to push. I feel more ready to try it than before,\" he added.\n\nRafael Nadal further noted that while he did not believe he played well against Bergs in his Italian Open opener, he took a lot of positives from the match and, therefore, hopes to build on that stability in the upcoming matches.\n\n\"I see it like a very positive today. Even if I didn't play well, that for me was a little bit in some ways surprising, in another hand not surprising because I didn't play much tennis for almost two years,\" Rafael Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to accept that my level, it's a little bit more on and off.

Bergs, however, fought back to stop Nadal from running away with the set, and earned his break back to restore parity at 4-4. Serving to stay ahead in the ninth game, the 22-time Grand Slam champion stumbled, allowing Bergs to take the set 6-4.\n\nThe second set began in identical fashion, with Rafael Nadal soon racing to a 3-1 lead with a break of serve. This time, the former World No. 1 did not let his advantage slip and consolidated the lead to seal the set 6-3 in his favor and force the decider.\n\nThe third set, once again, saw the southpaw racing to a 3-1 lead. Bergs threatened to reverse the situation similar to the first set, and had three break points on the Spaniard's serve at 2-3* 0-40. However, Nadal produced an extraordinary display of defense and spot serving to protect his lead.

But, as has been a feature in his comeback over the last few weeks, after an up soon came a down. He lost his serve immediately and then again at 4-4 to drop the opening set. A set in which Nadal won just 63 per cent of his first serve points -- an area of his game that has been most compromised by his latest injury. Bergs was also having joy going after the Nadal backhand, putting 74 per cent of his forehands into the Spaniard's weaker wing in the first set.\n\nTopsy-turvy exchanges of breaks have been a feature of Nadal's matches since his comeback, and the rhythm of the match exemplified his recent dance between fitness and pride -- up and down, high and low, looking in flashes like the great champion of the sport, in others like the world No 305 that he currently is. He has had more controlled wins, over Italian Flavio Cobolli in Barcelona and Darwin Blanch in Madrid, but on those occasions both opponents looked completely overawed by the Spaniard's 111-1 record in first-round matches on clay.\n\nBergs was not, using his inside-out forehand on Nadal's high, looping balls to crush them right back at him and wrestle control of points.\n\nComing back from a set down is something Nadal had not done before during his latest comeback from injury, but no-one is getting carried away, and being a believer at this point is simply to hope that Nadal can feel something like himself at Roland Garros.\n\nFor a while this looked like being Nadal's most humbling loss since he returned to the court in Barcelona three weeks ago. Losing to the world No 11 Alex de Minaur in Barcelona was no disgrace given the quality of opponent and the fact it was his first tournament back after so long -- with Nadal visibly withdrawing from contesting the second set to measure his body. Eventually succumbing to Jiri Lehecka in Madrid after three encouraging wins was entirely understandable too, especially given the quality of Lehecka's play in the straight-sets victory.\n\nThe momentum of the match changed after the end of the first set. There was a 10-minute delay in the first game of the second set as an unwell spectator received treatment. They were thankfully ok, and when play resumed Nadal held his serve to love and then promptly broke his opponent. Bergs won just two points in the first three games of the set.\n\nNadal faced break points in a couple of subsequent games, including when serving for the set, but he fended them off and reacted with trademark zeal. After a tricky overhead earned him a set point, Nadal levelled the match with a classic serve-plus-one play, where a serve is followed by a forehand winner. The 14-time Roland Garros champion has banked hundreds of millions of dollars with this play, and he celebrated this one with a little jump and a roar of \"vamos!\"\n\nThat feeling of Nadal rolling back the years was heightened when he pulled off a classic feat of escapology early in the third set. Nadal was on the back-foot serving at 0-1 when he fell to the floor. He then somehow got back to his feet and won the point with a forehand drop shot.\n\nThe crowd could not believe what they were seeing, especially given how much of a shadow of himself Nadal had looked an hour or so earlier. A string of brilliant crosscourt forehands helped Nadal break in the next game, and despite facing three break points at 3-2, Nadal clung on, and was relatively untroubled from then on in securing the victory.\n\nHearing the noise of the Rome crowd and feeling their energy, perhaps the lesson is not to worry too much about the bigger picture. About how Nadal is veering from vulnerable to vintage from one point to the next. About how beating a player outside the world's top 100 is clearly no reliable indicator of future performance.\n\nNadal has accepted that he needs to think outside himself -- to tally up his shots, slides, efforts and stretches in a calculation about what is to come next, whether in days, weeks, or months. But for tennis fans, maybe the best thing is to do the opposite: focus only on enjoying the moment.

Nadal, who has stated that he intends to retire after this season, spent the majority of last year nursing a hip injury that necessitated surgery before a muscle rupture in Brisbane halted his comeback in January.\n\nNadal returned to the circuit during the clay swing for tournaments in Barcelona and Madrid, and he is fit enough to compete in his third consecutive event in Rome. \"That hasn't happened since a very long time ago,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"That's good news. I need to keep going. I need to keep exploring how I'll be able to manage to play every day. But yeah, I'm happy the way that I feel today.\" The 22-time Grand Slam champion admitted to facing challenging moments in his last two events, as well as his first training session in Rome before Thursday's opening against Zizou Bergs.\n\n\"But in general, the line's going up, without a doubt,\" he added. \"Happy to be today where I am, because one month ago for me it was almost impossible to think that I'll be able to play in Barcelona, then in Madrid and now being here in Rome. \"I'm doing the things the proper way and trying to avoid a lot of risks in terms of pushing a lot in matches, I was able to keep moving.

Throughout 18 Italian Opens, he had lost just once in the opening round, but three double faults and two service breaks gave Bergs, of Belgium, the opening he needed to grab the first set and hope of winning the two-hour, 54-minute match.\n\n\"It was not my best match.

With age catching up with him and his physicality not being the same anymore, Rafa knows that he isn't the favorite to win the Masters 1000 event in which he is the most successful player of all-time. So Nadal revealed the mentality with which he's going to be approaching the tournament and he has once again gotten philosophical, which is admirable.\n\nIn an interview with Tennis TV, Rafael Nadal was asked to comment on his practice sessions in Rome which went viral on social media. The Spaniard also spoke about his shaky form at the moment. But more importantly, the King of Clay revealed that he was excited to set foot at the iconic Foro Italico. Instead of being optimistic about his chances, Nadal has decided to use a more realistic approach, trying to put on a good show.\n\n\"I arrived here on Saturday. Good days, better (other) days worse as always. But in general terms improving, no? I mean I feel good, I feel happy the way that things are improving and I am excited. Rome is one of the most important tournaments in my tennis career, no? Ten times winning here and a couple of unforgettable matches. I want to try and do it one more time at a good level here,\" Nadal commented.\n\nRafa is known for having a 'play-to-win' attitude. However, his approach of wanting to put on a memorable contest indirectly points towards the fact that the thought of retirement isn't weighing him down now.\n\nA few months ago, Nadal withdrew from tournaments and sounded extremely uncertain when it comes to his fitness. But having declared that in all likelihood, 2024 is set to be his last season on the ATP Tour, the Spaniard seems to be finding his feet faster on his return.\n\nThe Raging Bull spoke about the progress he has made from the Barcelona Open to the Madrid Open over the past few weeks.\n\n\"I always expect good things! I am a positive guy. But, in real life it's not every week better and better. Sometimes it's a little bit worse then I'm better again. Being ready to accept the challenges for how the things are coming. My moment is a bit unpredictable than a few years ago. So, I accept that and just try to live with doubts and with the moments I am living now and facing. But at the same time with hope that I can be competitive and can play good tennis,\" the former World No.1 said.\n\nAfter being eliminated by Alex de Minaur in the second round of the Barcelona Open, the 22-time Grand Slam winner made it to the fourth round of the Madrid Open. Many believe that Nadal could very well find his rhythm by the time the French Open 2024 begins in the fourth week of May.\n\nThe interview also shows that Rafael Nadal continues to have an interesting mix of being someone who his fans look up to for inspiration and at the time, is extremely relatable due to being honest about his struggles. But this isn't the only time that Rafa's comments have left fans in awe of him.\n\nBack in 2019, Rafael Nadal dismissed Grand Slam comparisons to Roger Federer. Instead, the Spaniard dished out a philosophical statement revealing to be satisfied with the legacy he has created.\n\n\"If I catch Roger or not, I am not very worried about it,\" Nadal said, per BBC Sport.\n\n\"You can't be frustrated all the time because the neighbour has a bigger house than you, or a bigger TV, or a better garden.\n\n\"I am going to try my best to keep enjoying tennis, giving myself chances to compete at the highest level, and we will see what happens,\" the Spaniard added.\n\nPlaying without any kind of pressure, Rafa has been enjoying his tennis, seemingly much happier to spend time on the tennis court.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull_(roller_coaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raging Bull (roller coaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/03/6fadcafb-rafael-nadal-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

While Alcaraz pulled out from the ATP Masters 1000 event with a right arm issue, Sinner withdrew citing a hip problem that cut short his Madrid Open run as well.\n\nNadal himself is trying to find consistency in terms of outings after yet another lengthy spell out. During a press conference in Rome, the former ATP World No. 1 was asked about youngsters like Alcaraz and Sinner sustaining serious injuries and if he knew of any \"solutions.\"\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam winner said that injuries have always been a part of tennis. However, he mentioned that considering Sinner's form so far this year, he will be sorely missed in the Italian capital. Nadal stated:\n\n\"The injuries have been always there. That's the truth. I understand that for you guys Jannik is not playing here is a terrible news, especially the way he's playing this year.\"\n\nThe Spaniard went on to say that if two of the world's best players are not able to play a prestigious tournament like the Italian Open, there is a \"deeper conversation\" to be had:\n\n\"We can talk about that (injuries) for hours because at the end we have been talking about that for so many years. Now with Carlos and with Jannik not playing here, the conversation is on the table again. Nothing changes. Just the coincidence that two of the best players of the world are injured today. So the conversation is a much deeper conversation that today the three [sic] best players of the world are not able to play in Rome.\"\n\nThe 10-time Italian Open champion also spoke about the evolution of tennis, which has had a lot to do about increasing the pace at which the game is played. According to Nadal, this trend has contributed to more and more hard courts, which are notorious for stretching players bodies' to their limits. The Spanish star added:\n\n\"If we want to talk about why people gets injured, I tell you very clear: when you push your body to the limit, you get injured at the end. When the game is faster and faster and faster, you get injured. When you play most of the year on hard courts and the surfaces are tougher for the body, you get injured. That's the simple answer.\"\n\nRafael Nadal to start his 2024 Italian Open campaign against qualifier Zizou Bergs\n\nNadal, who has entered the main draw of this year's Italian Open on a protected ranking, will start his campaign at the ATP Masters 1000 event against qualifier Zizou Bergs. The match, slated for Thursday, May 9, would mark the pair's maiden meeting on the ATP Tour.\n\nBergs qualified for the main draw after beating Patrick Kypson and Shang Juncheng across the first and second rounds of qualifying respectively.

In the last year and a half, Nadal has had several physical problems, his career has been affected and now his future is also at stake. Nadal was due to play his final season in 2024, but he has played very little and even his presence at Roland Garros is in serious jeopardy.\n\nNadal was supposed to play in Paris for the last time, but the tennis player still makes his presence conditional. During today's press conference, the Spaniard made the following statements: \"It's always fantastic to be here, the crowd is very warm and I feel great emotions.\n\nI remember the matches against Gullermo Coria and Roger Federer, the first two times I won here. It's a tournament with a great tradition and I am happy to be here again. Will I play at Roland Garros? I do not have a clear answer to that, because for now I am playing the tournament in Rome and not thinking about the next one.\n\nNadal's conditions are always to be evaluated and the tennis player (with the fan) wants to understand if he is really competitive for Paris's tournament.

A laser beam of a forehand having trapped Zizou Bergs on his backhand side with a series of sledgehammers.\n\nThat's handy, too, Bergs attempting to serve and volley but yorked by a fine return. Three break points...and the second of them is taken!\n\nA gorgeous backhand down-the-line drops a foot inside the baseline for Bergs, showing off his shot-making in these early proceedings and not seeming at all overawed to be facing the king of clay. A bunny hop of a bounce just before he strikes sends an attempted repeat of the shot long soon after, though, and a flapped forehand into the net gives Rafael Nadal a second game on serve.\n\nThat's a pleasant beginning on serve from Zizou Bergs, though, a booming serve and crisp forehand winner settling him into his work. He has got a good serving game, an upright, powerful strike, though a double fault at 30-0 frustrates the Belgian.\n\nNo matter - back in business with an ace. A missed volley but Bergs closes it out.\n\nA simple enough start for Rafael Nadal, holding to 15 with a big serve up the centre forcing an error to seal it.\n\nA whipped forehand drags Bergs wide, and the Belgian can't keep his hooked backhand in play. First point to Nadal.\n\nA huge cheer for Rafael Nadal as he emerges into the bright Italian sunshine.\n\nBut the attention will be firmly on Rafael Nadal's fitness and form ahead of Roland Garros. He's won this tournament ten times, but even he misses out on the trophy, a deep run here would go a long way towards getting him ready for the cut and thrust of grand slam tennis.\n\nThis is a good chance for Belgium's Zizou Bergs, with the 24-year-old beginning to threaten the world's top 100 but still without a really significant win at ATP Tour level. Named, yes, after Zinedine Zidane (or to be more specific a football training drill his father used to complete tagged with the Frenchman's nickname), the Belgian is coming off some encouraging form on the Challenger circuit in Florida, losing in the final in Sarasota to Thanasi Kokkinakis before besting Mitchell Krueger in Tallahassee to defend his title.\n\nShe really had to work to secure victory, saving a set point in the second to take it to a tie break, but that's a good win, in the end, for Linda Noskova. The Czech teenager, a quarter-finalist at the Australian Open earlier this year, will hope to build on that second round win on a surface that hasn't necessarily been her favourite so far in a young career.\n\nNoskova departs as the Rome crowd swells in anticipation for the arrival of Rafael Nadal.\n\nRafael Nadal embraces 'challenge' of returning to regular playing schedule\n\nNadal, who has said he expects to retire after this season, spent most of last year nursing a hip issue that required surgery, before a muscle tear in Brisbane stalled his comeback in January.\n\nThe 37-year-old returned to the tour during the clay swing for tournaments in Barcelona and Madrid, and is fit enough to play his third event in a row in Rome.\n\nRafael Nadal embraces 'challenge' of returning to regular playing schedule\n\nYes, Rafael Nadal is gearing up for another Roland-Garros title tilt this week in Rome, with the Spaniard due seconod on centre court at the conclusion of the match between Linda Noskova and Lucrezia Stefanini. Noskova took the first set but is finding it tough to put a battling Stefanini, on home soil, away - it's 5-5 in the second.\n\nNadal is on the comeback trail from injury in his final season before retirement and continues his preparation for the French Open this week in Rome.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His ball becomes all of a sudden a few kilometers an hour faster.\n\n\"All of a sudden his footwork and foot speed becomes a lot faster.\n\n\"It's more difficult to hit a winner, especially on Philippe Chatrier, which is a massive court, so he has a lot more space. It is very difficult. It's probably the biggest challenge in tennis. It's the biggest challenge that you can have in our sport, playing Nadal on that court.\n\n\"You have a feeling that you just can't put him away. I think the first set that I played against him basically describes it to perfection.\n\n\"I mean, I won that set I don't know how many times against any other player, and I still somehow manage lose it in the tiebreak.\n\n\"I was up 6-2 in the tiebreak. He aced me I think for the first time in the entire match. Then he hit one of the most ridiculous passing shots I've ever seen in my entire life.\n\n\"Then at 6-5, there was also a very un-unique point that he's won and I was in control.\n\n\"Somehow you feel like you're winning, but then somehow you end up not. It's just something that you only feel against him on that specific court.\"\n\nZverev went on to suggest he is hoping to have one last chance to play Nadal at this year's Roland Garros tournament, as he hopes to create memories to savour against the Spaniard rather than the pain he remembers from two years ago.\n\n\"I would love to do it one more time just simply to kind of have a different ending to those memories, right? That's just something in my mind.\n\n\"I would love to play him one more time. I would love to play him in a final or semifinal, in a big match again. I think that would be great for both of us. We'll see how it will be for him.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_palmer@tennis365.com", "name": "Kevin Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://d2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2022/06/04053421/040620221654313644-e1654329891840.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

And Rafa (Nadal) reciprocated, working on each point as if he were a kid who was just starting out. Because the Balearic Islands are not ready to be a cyclone due to age and injuries, but the hope still moves them. With that attitude and with a good dose of experience Nadal rose to come back against the surprising Belgian Zizou Bergs whom he beat 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in 2 hours and 53 minutes in his debut in Rome. In the second round, a bone awaits him this Saturday: the Polish Hubert Hurkacz, world number 9.\n\nNadal had said the day before that he was feeling better than he expected. After playing two games at God\u00f3 and four in Madrid he had gained confidence and his tennis and, above all, his legs had been gaining strength. He is not a logically superlative Nadal but he does enjoy himself and wants to evolve with a view to Roland Garros. He had the Belgian Bergs in front of him, unknown to the general public. 24 years old and 108th in the world, he is a tennis player like so many. Without a shiny past and coming from the previous phase. The start was adjusted to all these parameters. Nadal only needed to not fail to take the helm of the match. 3-1 and serve for the Balearic Islands. Palms in the Foro Italico and aroma of dressing function for a Nadal who has won ten times in Rome.\n\nBut, suddenly, the Manacor native began to fail incessantly, lost his serve and gave wings to the Belgian, who grew. From 3-1 it went to 4-6 for Bergs, as Nadal gave up his serve on a second occasion and with an inopportune double fault.\n\n16 unforced errors in 47 minutes are too many, even for this more autumnal and earthy version of Nadal. The Spaniard had gotten into trouble and had been forced to make a comeback that once again tested his physique.\n\nOf course he had a little respite when a spectator got dizzy in the stands. The match stopped for more than ten minutes and Nadal took the opportunity to breathe and vent with his coach, Carlos Moy\u00e0, who was telling him to let go of his arm. The Balearic listened to him while he muttered under his breath, visibly angry.\n\nBut those moments were very good for him, he began to move his rival, change his heights and minimize errors to the delight of the spectators, who cheered him on. He was already a more recognizable and effective Nadal while Bergs had difficulty interpreting the game. Even so, the Spaniard had to fight to take the second set ahead 6-3 after saving a couple of break points. In the final round he was more solid and pulled boards to save new break points. He fought and won.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balearic_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balearic Islands"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Balearic Islands"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manacor", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manacor"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manacor"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Moy\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Moy\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_14b3b.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It will, therefore, be the first ever occasion of the young man getting an opportunity to take on the greatest claycourt player ever.\n\nBergs was born a year after the French national team won the FIFA World Cup in 1998. Zinedine Zidane, nicknamed \"Zizou\", was the most influential player on that team and also scored a brace in the final. Hence, Bergs was named after the French legend, as per ATP.\n\nInterestingly, it was Zidane who handed over the French Open trophy to Nadal in 2005, when the southpaw won his maiden title there.\n\nFast forward to almost two decades, and the King of Clay will take on a player named after the French soccer icon.\n\nZizou Bergs' career so far\n\nHowever, Bergs has not done much in his fledgling career so far. He has a very ordinary 9-23 win-loss record, having turned professional in 2018. He has won eight Challenger-level titles, the latest of which came at Tallahassee in April this year.\n\nHe made his Grand Slam debut at Wimbledon in 2022 as a wild card. Subsequently he has played the first round of the Australian Open in 2023 and 2024. However, Bergs has not been able to go past the first round in any of the Majors he has played in.

A win against Hurkacz would pit Nadal against either Thiago Seyboth Wild or Tomas Martin Etcheverry in the third round in Rome, with a potential clash against second seed Daniil Medvedev in the fourth round.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akchhat_bachheti@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Akchhat Bachheti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1s_Mart\u00edn_Etcheverry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00edn Etcheverry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Seyboth_Wild", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Seyboth Wild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/cacb7-17152734384738-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Another video of his which is doing the rounds is from the 2018 edition of the tournament when he agreed to practice with Russian legend Maria Sharapova. Fans not only enjoyed their engaging rally, but also lauded Rafael Nadal for being a true 'gentleman'.\n\nAn Instagram video by Baseline Highlights showed a video where Nadal and Sharapova were seen practicing in Rome on clay. Sharapova matched up to Nadal in every shot and in the end, won the rally as Nadal hit one shot over her head and out of the court.\n\nBut this wasn't the usual Rafael Nadal in practice sessions. Fans believe that Nadal went easy on her because she is a lady and he has too much respect for any female player to go all berserk on them.\n\n\"Throwback to when Maria Sharapova stepped onto the practice court with Rafa and hit a few balls,\" Baseline Highlights captioned in the post.\n\nThat rally seemed to have helped Maria Sharapova. In the Italian Open 2018, she beat the likes of Jelena Ostapenko, Ashleigh Barty and Dominika Cibulkova en route to the semi-final. Maria Sharapova lost to Simona Halep by 6-4, 1-6, 4-6.\n\nRafael Nadal, on the other hand, had a terrific season. He won his 8th Italian Open title in 2018, beating Alexander Zverev 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 in the final. Nadal did not have an easy path in the tournament, as he had to overcome Denis Shapovalov in the Round of 16, Fabio Fognini in the quarter-final and Novak Djokovic in the semifinals.\n\nNo one compares to Rafael Nadal when it comes to achievements on clay. His 14 French Opens, 12 Barcelona Opens, 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, 10 Italian Opens, and 5 Madrid Open titles are just mind-boggling. But Maria Sharapova, with her 2 hard-fought French Opens, 3 Italian Opens, and 1 Madrid Open titles, has done exceptionally well on clay among female players of her generation.\n\nAhead of the Mallorca Open 2019, Sharapova spoke about Rafael Nadal, just after he won his 12th French Open title.\n\n\"He is the ultimate fighter and an amazing example of what you can achieve if you have the will and the passion for what you do. I've always admired the way he has fought through all the injuries he's had and he's the greatest example of that. The sport is so physical, especially the way he plays, but brings an optimistic perspective on his work that he can come back and be a champion. He is extremely motivated,\" Sharapova said in a media interaction, as The Indian Express reported.\n\nEven if not like Nadal, Maria Sharapova has definitely left a legacy as a champion, especially someone who excelled on clay.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanmay_roy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tanmay Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sharapova", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sharapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je\u013cena_Ostapenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Je\u013cena Ostapenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Shapovalov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denis Shapovalov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashleigh_Barty", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashleigh Barty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominika_Cibulkov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominika Cibulkov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte-Carlo Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Fognini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fabio Fognini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/acb67103-rafael-nadal-maria-sharapova.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

I need to prove myself if I am able to push my body to the limit, I need to push to feel myself ready for what's coming,\" Nadal told reporters.\n\n\"I am not talking only about Roland Garros.

He now faces a significant test against Hubert Hurkacz, the seventh seed, in round two.\n\nRelated: 'Baby Fed' no more: Grigor Dimitrov has grown up and is in form of his life\n\n\"[Now] arrive[s] the moment that I need to try, I need to go for everything,\" the Spaniard said. \"If something happens, something happens.

While the 37-year old's unforced error count rose swiftly, and he was extremely tentative from behind the baseline, Bergs stepped up to the biggest match of his career determined to take control of as many exchanges as possible by attacking his opponent's forehand and closing down the net.\n\nIn just his third Masters 1000 match, Bergs showed that he is more than capable of competing on the ATP tour. Across the three sets, though, Nadal was more consistent and he found a way to produce his best tennis in the important moments. \"Today was not a good match for me,\" he said. \"I didn't play the way that I really think I can play and I need to play. I was able to find a way to win, and that gave me the chance to play in two days again, to show myself, especially that I can do it much better than today.\"\n\nAfter the match, Nadal explained that in the surgery he underwent last year, part of his psoas [hip] tendon was removed and he is still in the process of \"adapt[ing] the muscles to the configuration of the hip\". But with the clay court season at its final two big events, the Italian Open and Roland Garros, he is out of time.\n\n\"I am not talking only about Roland Garros,\" the 14-time French Open champion said. \"I am talking about the next match. I need to lose this fear. Matches like today help. Some moments I was moving faster. Some moments not. I need to get used to that, to take that risk. It's a moment to [make] that happen. If something wrong happens, we going to accept it. But that's the moment to push.

When asked about the next Grand Slam i.e. the French Open, Djokovic mentioned that as long as Rafael Nadal was playing, he will always remain the biggest threat.\n\nNow, after Nadal has availed himself of the French Open, right after the Italian Open, Djokovic was once again asked about the Spaniard. And his response was iconic.\n\nRafael Nadal will be eyeing for a record 15th French Open title this year, while Novak Djokovic would be looking to defend his title and make it No.4 on the Parisian clay. And Nadal leads their head-to-head 8-2 in the clay-court Grand Slam.\n\nLooking back at the experience he has in playing his biggest archrival, Novak Djokovic opened up in a press conference at the Italian Open recently about the electrifying energy Rafael Nadal brings, especially on clay. And this is the most prevalent at Roland Garros. The World No.1 used the word 'impenetrable', which is as good as saying it is next to impossible to beat him there.\n\n\"It's impenetrable, you know. He's like a wall, you know. It's really a paramount challenge, you know, to play him in Roland Garros. He's an incredible athlete. the tenacity and the intensity he brings on the court, particularly there is, is something that, is very, was very rarely seen, I think in the history of the sport,\" Djokovic was quoted as saying.\n\n\"So, I'm sure that he's going to be very emotional tournament for him. You know, as it is, probably was in Madrid and here. But there in particular because of all the records he has.\"\n\nDjokovic is the second person in two days to speak about what it's like to face Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros. Alexander Zverev spoke about the same a day before starting his Italian Open 2024 journey. His response was more of awe, especially when he recalled the 2022 semi-final between them.\n\nEver since Nadal announced his participation at the French Open, many discussions have revolved around him. While Djokovic talked about the 22-time Grand Slam champion's defense and athletic skills, Zverev was stupefied by the increased speed of his shots at the French Open.\n\nA week and a half ago, ex-Australian player Paul McNamee was on The AO Show podcast, speaking about his book 'Welcome to the Dance: Master Clay to Master Tennis,' and why clay-court tennis is the best form of tennis there is. McNamee was very detailed in his analysis debunking the various myths of clay courts and explaining why players who excel on that surface are the greatest of them all.\n\nIn that, he explained that Rafael Nadal and Bjorn Borg, who also won 6 French Open titles, are probably the greatest clay court players of all time. McNamee didn't mention Guillermo Vilas, who won the most number of clay court matches to date. McNamee explained that Nadal has the best forehand of all.\n\nThe Spaniard's movements on clay are also like 'poetry in motion'. McNamee also explains how Nadal always keeps his opponents guessing till the very last moment. He doesn't give up, and in the end, forces them to make mistakes. This is how Nadal won the French Open year after year.\n\nMcNamee said, \"So I'm not a great fan of players who are not good on clay. Yeah, that's true... Well look Rafa and Bjorn Borg are far and away the grand masters, we can call them chess, cause clay is chess at the end of the day, hard court is draught. They are quite different games. One is linear, one is angular, one has nuances, one does not. So, a clay court is a chess board. So, the grandmasters are Rafael Nadal and Bjorn Borg.\"\n\nMcNamee ends his discussion by naming Carlos Alcaraz as the true heir to Rafael Nadal. He believes that the 20-year-old can shatter all clay-court records set by Rafael Nadal, provided he plays that long.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanmay_roy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tanmay Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McNamee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul McNamee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Vilas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guillermo Vilas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/65b9312e-untitled-design-15.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The Spaniard wasn't convincing from a gaming point of view, but he still found a way to win the match and give himself what will be an important test with Hubert Hurkacz, in the second round.\n\nAnd Nadal was very clear at the press conference. All the efforts made to get back up after yet another injury have been completed in order to have the opportunity to push himself beyond all limits at the Roland Garros. This is why he continues to compete and why he reached Rome for the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.\n\n\"Today was not a good match for me. I didn't play the way I think I can play. I was able to find a way to win and this gives me a chance to play here again. I can play better than today. Obviously the improvement is important: the biggest one is still being able to play. In Barcelona I wasn't sure I would play. Now I'm serving better, I feel faster. Sometimes I play too far from the baseline and that's something I have to change. Even though I didn't play well, I was surprised, I have to accept that my level can fluctuate. I have to find stability, a match like this helps you. I feel close to showing something much more positive than the first games in Barcelona. I feel close, and that's why I'm playing. I can do much better than today and I hope to do so. However, I am very happy with the victory,\" he told.\n\nTalking about his recovery journey, the 22-time Slam champion then said: \"It's hard, I did things step by step trying to improve slowly. It's not easy and not just because of the defeats, but because of the sensations I felt with some shots. .\n\nIt's about adapting my body and muscles to the hip problem. I've made some progress in the last few weeks. It's time to give it a try and if something happens, something happens. I have to understand if I can adapt to new problems.\n\nNow I'm in Rome and the time has come to understand if I can push my body to the limit, give everything and be ready for the Roland Garros. If something bad happens, I will accept it,\" he analyzed.\n\nRafael Nadal's return to Rome was historic. In a magical atmosphere, the Spanish champion inflamed the Central Court of the Foro Italico for what could be the one of the last time in his career, flooded by the warmth and support of the crowd present. At 37, Nadal struggled tremendously against the commendable Bergs, who played by far the best match of his career, but in the end Rafa prevailed, prevailing after almost three hours of play with a score of 4-6 6-3 6-4. At the end of the match, the Majorcan champion let out a celebration that means a lot, almost seeming to want to shout like: I don't want to give up yet. A special victory, which gives the Spanish tennis player a further record that adds to the already very long list of career firsts.\n\nNadal became the first player in history to win 70 matches in two Masters 1000 tournaments: 73 victories in Monte Carlo, while those in the Italian capital became 70. The victory against Bergs allows the Spanish champion to move up the rankings again. Starting at the beginning of 2024, after a year without taking the court, from position 664, Nadal returned to the top 300, settling in 272nd place. Now, however, the mission becomes much more complicated, because the next opponent will be the Polish Hubert Hurkacz. In case of success against the number 8 of the ATP ranking it would allow the Spaniard to get even closer to the top 250. One step after another, to get ready for the last dance in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_ciotti@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Lorenzo Ciotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The last of which, as highlighted by the OptaAce Twitter profile, is truly particular. Among the many records that the Spaniard has achieved, the 14 titles at the Roland Garros is the most famous, but there are others that certainly need to be analysed. This one in particular.\n\nNadal has won all 40 matches he has played in ATP Masters 1000 tournaments against players who came from qualifiers or lucky losers. Rafa, in every ATP Masters 1000 tournament in which he has participated, has never lost against a qualifier or against a lucky loser. In Rome, in his first round, Nadal could increase this statistic and take it to 41-0. There is only one other player who has played ten or more matches in the ATP Masters 1000 against qualifiers or lucky losers without losing a match. This is Boris Becker, who has a record of 13-0 since this tournament format was introduced in 1990.\n\nNadal will play the ATP tournament in Rome for the last time. A tournament that gave him great satisfaction was that he managed to win 10 times in his career. The Spanish player who after the Foro Italico will decide whether to play at Roland Garros in the long distance of three sets out of five, was drawn in Rome in the last quarter of the draw. The one whose main seeds are the Polish Hubert Hurkacz and the Russian Daniil Medvedev. The Spanish player, 22 times Slam champion in the first round will challenge an opponent from the qualifiers, and in case of success in the second round there would be the challenge against Hurkacz.\n\nAs mentioned, Rafa will probably play his last tournament in Rome. The Internazionali BNL d'Italia, which he won 10 times, is, together with the Roland Garros, Barcelona and Monte-Carlo, the Spaniard's favorite event, where he expressed himself at the best of his career. After the round of 32 in Barcelona and the round of 16 in Madrid, Nadal will try to move forward, pushing himself a little further, in Rome, to try to improve his physical form for the Roland Garros. According to Paolo Bertolucci, former tennis player now commentator on Sky Sport, it won't be easy to see him through. Trying to analyze his path in Rome, after his debut against a qualified tennis player, Rafa could immediately come across the Polish Hubert Hurkacz. Then the possible challenge with one of Thiago Seyboth Wild or Sebastian Baez. If he gets there, the round of 16 could pit the Spaniard against his first major opponent, Holger Rune.\n\n\"Difficult in the quarterfinals, but don't despair,\" the commentator wrote on X, giving his opinion on where the Spanish champion will go in the Italian ATP Masters 1000.\n\n\"I won ten titles and experienced great emotions. I dreamed of playing at least once in all the tournaments where I won a lot, and Rome is clearly one of them. I want to go there, try to do well, to be competitive and I will work hard to make this happen,\" Nadal said at the media day in Rome.\n\nRafa, together with Novak Djokovic, will be the real stars of this tournament, even considering the absence of the young Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, both knocked out after the last intense period of play.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_ciotti@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Lorenzo Ciotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_loser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucky loser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Becker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boris Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebasti\u00e1n_B\u00e1ez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebasti\u00e1n B\u00e1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Seyboth_Wild", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Seyboth Wild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paolo_Bertolucci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paolo Bertolucci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148511.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The Spaniard was facing Zizou Bergs in the first round of his Italian Open campaign today.\n\nThe 37-year-old lost the first set and was searching for momentum in the second. While he was aiming for a comeback, his sister Maria Isabel, was spotted motivating him.\n\nMaribel could be seen cheering for her brother from the stands. Watch the video below:\n\nZizou Bergs defeated Patrick Kypson and Shen Juncheng in the first and second qualification rounds to earn a spot in the main draw. Nadal eventually beat Bergs 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to make it to the next round of the Masters 1000 event where he will play World No. 9 Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nRafael Nadal weighed in on Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner's absence from the 2024 Italian Open\n\nNadal recently voiced his opinion at the press conference in Rome on youngsters such as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz facing injuries. He started by expressing his views on Sinner's absence [13:53 onwards].\n\n\"The injuries have been always there. That's the truth. I understand that for you guys Jannik is not playing here is a terrible news, especially the way he's playing this year.\n\n\"We can talk about that (injuries) for hours because at the end we have been talking about that for so many years. Now with Carlos and with Jannik not playing here, the conversation is on the table again. Nothing changes. Just the coincidence that two of the best players of the world are injured today. So the conversation is a much deeper conversation that today the three [sic] best players of the world are not able to play in Rome.\"\n\nThe former World No. 1 further stated how playing on hard courts makes the players more susceptible to injuries. Nadal also highlighted how on-court exertion becomes a cause of injury.\n\n\"If we want to talk about why people get injured, I tell you very clear: when you push your body to the limit, you get injured at the end. When the game is faster and faster and faster, you get injured. When you play most of the year on hard courts and the surfaces are tougher for the body, you get injured. That's the simple answer,\" he added.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz pulled out of the Italian Open, citing \"muscle edema\" in his pronator teres. The Spaniard played his last match at the Madrid Open, where he was knocked out by Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinals. On the other hand, Sinner withdrew due to a hip injury.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akchhat_bachheti@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Akchhat Bachheti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/a3bda-17152664473554-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

I'm enjoying playing, by the way. I am happy doing what I do. When I talk about retirement, it's not because I'm no longer happy playing or I don't feel competitive enough.

Concentrating all the attention on themselves, which otherwise they would also have had to share with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, both out due to injury.\n\nDuring the media day of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, Nadal focused on the numerous injuries that are affecting tennis players, focusing precisely on Sinner and Alcaraz.\n\n\"Jannik and Carlos are young and still have many years to play here and have many successes.

The Spaniard, after taking part in two consecutive tournaments between Barcelona and Madrid, will return to play the Internazionali BNL d'Italia two years after the last time and will challenge Zizou Bergs in the first round.\n\nRafa hasn't played a match in Rome since 2022, when he was defeated by Denis Shapovalov. A few weeks later, however, he managed to win his 22nd Slam at the Roland Garros, accomplishing an epic feat.\n\nRafa comes from a series of problems that have affected his last two years. He will take advantage of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia to test his conditions again after Barcelona and Madrid and give himself a chance at his beloved Roland Garros. On the media day of the tournament, Rafa answered a question from our colleagues at Tennis World Italia about what playing in Rome means to him.\n\n\"It's always fantastic to be here. The crowd is very warm. This is not the time to explain all the emotions I felt here, on this court. Fantastic matches with Coria and Roger Federer the first two times I played here. Then I managed to win that tournament many times, right? It's a tournament that is part of the history of our sport and has a lot of tradition. I'm excited and feel lucky to be back here at this stage of my career,\" he explained.\n\nOn participating in the Roland Garros, Nadal then added: \"I don't have a clear answer now. First of all I want to play in Rome. This is the tournament I'm involved in today, I'm not thinking about the next one. I just want to enjoy every day. I enjoy playing and we'll see if my body allows me to carry on. When I talk about retirement, I'm not saying it because I don't like playing tennis anymore. It's about the fact that the body didn't allow me to compete for multiple weeks in a row and enjoy training on a daily basis. If you are unable to enjoy yourself due to pain and injuries, there comes a time when it no longer makes sense. Now I'm about to experience my third week in a row on the Tour and it's a good time. My level is growing.\"\n\nRafa then talked about the stages leading up to the Italian Open.\n\n\"I spent a few days at home and then arrived in Rome on Saturday. I managed to train more or less well in the last few days. I'm excited to play in Rome. It's a tournament where I made so many unforgettable memories. We'll see how it goes day by day. It's my third consecutive week on Tour and I haven't played three tournaments in a row in a while. This is a good news. I have to keep moving forward, but I'm happy with how I feel today,\" he analyzed.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_ciotti@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Lorenzo Ciotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Shapovalov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denis Shapovalov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Coria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guillermo Coria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148509.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Beyond his tennis prowess, the Spaniard is known to be quite skilled at football and golf as well.\n\nFollowing his fourth-round exit from the Madrid Open, Nadal headed to Rome for the Italian Open, where he has been diligently preparing for his campaign at the Masters 1000 event.\n\nIn one of his recent practice sessions, the Spaniard wowed the packed crowd by showcasing his impressive football skills, passing tennis balls to his coach while displaying fancy footwork.\n\nGilles Simon reacted to a clip of the 37-year-old's football prowess on social media, calling out those who once doubted Rafael Nadal's talent.\n\nHe hailed the former World No. 1 as a \"gifted\" athlete, contending that he would've won the prestigious Ballon d'Or award on 10 occasions if he were a professional football player. It is worth mentioning that Lionel Messi, who holds the record for most Ballons d'Or in history, has won the coveted award eight times.\n\nSimon also suggested that the 37-year-old would've won 15 Majors if he played golf professionally, pointing to the Spaniard's tally of 22 Grand Slam titles as evidence of his remarkable talent.\n\n\"A little thought to all those who presented him to us as a hard worker without much talent in his early years, when he is a gifted person who would have had 10 Golden Balls if he had played football, 15 Major if he had played golf, and therefore 22 GC playing tennis,\" he posted on x (formerly Twitter).\n\nRafael Nadal's passion for football is well known, especially his support for Real Madrid and his home team, RCD Mallorca. Prior to his Madrid Open campaign, he enthusiastically cheered Real Madrid on their victory over Barcelona in the blockbuster El Clasico clash.\n\nThe Spaniard's golf ability is also notable, as he triumphed at the 2024 edition of the Balearic Amateur men's championships in February.\n\nRafael Nadal: \"I am a competitive person, but not just in tennis, it cost me not being able to play golf\"\n\nRafael Nadal had to sit out almost the entirety of the 2023 season due to a hip injury. The Spaniard revealed that what he missed most during his hiatus was being able to indulge his fierce competitive spirit, lamenting his inability to play golf during his recovery.\n\n\"Competition! Ultimately I am a competitive person, but not just in tennis, it cost me not being able to play golf which after all is a way to compete, it cost me not being able to compete in other areas,\" he said during a business conference in Madrid.\n\nOn the tennis front, the 22-time Grand Slam champion shared that he missed the electrifying feeling of competing in packed stadiums at the best tournaments.\n\n\"In tennis, I missed being on the circuit, being able to compete, feeling like a player, going out on the best courts with a full stadium; of course, I miss it, but you have to deal with it,\" he added.\n\nNadal will have the opportunity to relish that feeling at the 2024 Italian Open, as he takes on Zizou Bergs in his opening match.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "urvi_mehra@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Urvi Mehra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Simon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gilles Simon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD_Mallorca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RCD Mallorca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cl\u00e1sico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Cl\u00e1sico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balearic_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balearic Islands"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Balearic Islands"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/e1f5b-17152350701378-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Her conviction was well-founded, as Nadal entered the 2015 edition of the claycourt Major as the five-time defending champion.\n\nThe 2015 French Open represented a significant juncture in both players' careers, as Williams pursued the milestone of her 20th Grand Slam title while the Spaniard sought his record-extending 10th Roland Garros title.\n\nAhead of their respective campaigns, Serena Williams pondered the \"amazing\" prospect of Rafael Nadal clinching his 10th title at the claycourt Major, drawing a parallel to Martina Navratilova's remarkable nine Wimbledon titles.\n\nWilliams backed the 'King of Clay' to achieve the extraordinary feat, if not in 2015, then in the following year. The American also emphasized that the accomplishment would be \"iconic\" for the sport and expressed her belief that it would likely remain unmatched.\n\n\"It's amazing. I mean, in sport, it's never been done before. I mean, I think Martina Navratilova did 9 at Wimbledon, which is amazing. And then now he has opportunity to do 10 at Roland Garros; nonetheless, just makes it that much more difficult,\" she said in her pre-tournament press conference.\n\n\"Honestly, I feel like he can do it. If he doesn't do it this year, he can do it next year. He's young enough to have an opportunity to get to that number, and it's just -- I think tennis and for sport in general, it's iconic.

The Spaniard is a record 10-time champion at the Masters 1000 tournament in Rome.\n\nNadal faced Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs in his first-round match at the Italian Open on May 9. The 37-year-old made a slow start to the match and Bergs took advantage of it as he broke the Spaniard twice to take the first set. Nadal was more in his groove in the following two sets.\n\nThe Spaniard displayed improved consistency as he broke Belgium's highest-ranked ATP player once in the second and third sets to seal a come-from-behind victory 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.

But the important thing is that he prevailed against Bergs and got a good start to his campaign at the Italian Open.\n\n\"It was not my best match. I was practising better than how I played today without a doubt but I found a way to win. That is so important at the beginning of the tournament. My game is more unpredictable than before.

fresh from winning the Madrid Open title - started as she means to go on against American qualifier Bernarda Pera.\n\nThe world number one stormed to a 6-0 6-2 victory with 77 minutes on the clock as she chases a third Rome crown, having prevailed at the WTA 1000 tournament in 2021 and 2022, although she was broken while serving for the match before getting the job done.\n\nSwiatek's third-round opponent will be Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva, while Coco Gauff eased past the world number one's fellow Pole Magdalena Frech, prevailing 6-3 6-3.\n\nElsewhere, Naomi Osaka came up trumps 6-3 6-2 against Ukrainian 19th seed Marta Kostyuk to set up an intriguing third-round battle with 10th seed Daria Kasatkina, but Ekaterina Alexandrova -

Adverse weather conditions disrupted Thursday's Italian Open action, but either side of the heavens opening, the sun shone down on the Roman clay as a plethora of enticing first and second-round battles took place.\n\nThe men's record holder Rafael Nadal unsurprisingly stole the headlines as he began his Italian Open swansong, but Great Britain suffered mixed fortunes as two of their male players took to the court in round one.\n\nHere, Sports Mole looks at some of the highlights of today's action at the Masters tournament.\n\nRafael Nadal beats Zizou Bergs in three\n\nAlready boasting an unprecedented 10 Italian Open titles throughout his glittering career, Rafael Nadal remains on course for number 11 thanks to a pulsating three-set triumph over Belgium's Zizou Bergs, where he was forced to do it the hard way.\n\nThe beloved Spaniard took two hours and 53 minutes to triumph 4-6 6-3 6-4 and avoid just a second loss in 19 first-round matches at the Italian Open, although he admitted afterwards that his performance was not his finest.\n\nNadal hit 23 winners and 32 unforced errors in his opening battle, but his returning mastery came to the fore as he saved seven of the nine break points that the Belgian brought up, advancing on a shanked backhand from Bergs.\n\nThe 10-time champion now faces a stern test of his physical mettle against seventh seed Hubert Hurkacz, and should he come through that showdown, either Tomas Martin Etcheverry or Thiago Seyboth Wild will await in round three.\n\nJack Draper through but Dan Evans crashes out\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWith Cameron Norrie receiving a bye into the second round as the 27th seed, Thursday's action saw compatriots Jack Draper and Dan Evans try to join their national number one in the last 64, but only the former succeeded in doing so.\n\nDraper had never competed at the Italian Open before 2024 and squared up to last year's quarter-finalist Borna Coric, but he cruised past the Croatian number one 7-5 6-1 in just 96 minutes, firing eight aces and not facing a single break point.\n\nThe 22-year-old's reward will be a second-round showdown with defending champion Daniil Medvedev, but Evans's poor form continued as he fell to a 4-6 6-3 2-6 loss to home favourite Fabio Fognini late at night.\n\nThe 33-year-old has now lost each of his last five matches on the ATP Tour and paid the price for wasted opportunities against Fognini, only managing to convert four of the 12 break points he fashioned.\n\nIga Swiatek bagels Bernarda Pera\n\nReigning women's champion Elena Rybakina did not take to the court on Thursday, but top seed Iga Swiatek - fresh from winning the Madrid Open title - started as she means to go on against American qualifier Bernarda Pera.\n\nThe world number one stormed to a 6-0 6-2 victory with 77 minutes on the clock as she chases a third Rome crown, having prevailed at the WTA 1000 tournament in 2021 and 2022, although she was broken while serving for the match before getting the job done.\n\nSwiatek's third-round opponent will be Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva, while Coco Gauff eased past the world number one's fellow Pole Magdalena Frech, prevailing 6-3 6-3.\n\nElsewhere, Naomi Osaka came up trumps 6-3 6-2 against Ukrainian 19th seed Marta Kostyuk to set up an intriguing third-round battle with 10th seed Daria Kasatkina, but Ekaterina Alexandrova - seeded 14th - was stunned by qualifier Aliaksandra Sasnovich, who ran out a 6-0 6-1 victor.\n\nID:543272:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect7042:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Draper_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Draper (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Evans_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Evans (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1s_Mart\u00edn_Etcheverry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1s Mart\u00edn Etcheverry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Seyboth_Wild", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Seyboth Wild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Norrie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Norrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Fognini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fabio Fognini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Fr\u0119ch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magdalena Fr\u0119ch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekaterina_Alexandrova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ekaterina Alexandrova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daria_Kasatkina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daria Kasatkina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliaksandra_Sasnovich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliaksandra Sasnovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borna_\u0106ori\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borna \u0106ori\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Putintseva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Putintseva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Kostyuk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marta Kostyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernarda_Pera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernarda Pera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/19/rafael-nadal.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548832", "eventUri": "eng-9548832", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 452987624, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 116, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 116}}}

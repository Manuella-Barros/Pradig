From icks to assistanthood, Deco sat down with Zac and Joey to get the tea. Joey King (as Zara Ford): \u201cMom?\u201d Zac Efron (as Chris Cole): \u201cHuh!\u201d [Nicole Kidman screams, followed by Joey King. Joey tries to run out of the room but hits her head on the wall.] Imagine walking in on your mom getting it on with your boss. Eeek! That\u2019s what happens to Joey King\u2019s character, when she catches actor Zac Efron with actress Nicole Kidman. The problem? Liza Koshy (as Eugenie): \u201cThis is your mom, and your boss, who you hate. It\u2019s weird.\u201d But there was no hate on set. Zac Efron: \u201cMaking this movie was really fun. We got to laugh a lot.\u201d Joey King: \u201cYes, so much laughing.\u201d Laughs, but also some tears. Joey King: \u201cIt\u2019s such a lighthearted and fun movie, but we also touch on really serious things like grief and, you know, insecurities, and relationship growth in terms of friendship and motherhood.\u201d It was Joey\u2019s first time working with Nicole, but not Zac\u2019s. Zac Efron (as Jack Jansen: \u201cYou don\u2019t love him.\u201d Nicole Kidman (as Charlotte Bless): \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d Joey King: \u201cHe did a movie with Nicole.\u201d Zac Efron: \u201cWe did a movie 12 years ago, called \u2018The Paperboy.\u2019 I knew that coming into this film that working with Nicole, that we already had the relationship down, we felt safe with each other. At least I felt safe with her, so, yeah, it was exciting to kind of pick up where we left off.\u201d Zac Efron (as Chris Cole): \u201cYou put my shahtoosh in a plastic bag with my dirty sneakers? It\u2019s one of a kind. I only have two!\u201d So, any must-haves when hiring your right-hand person? Joey King: \u201cI don\u2019t have an assistant. I\u2019ve never had an assistant in my real life.\u201d Zac Efron: \u201cI\u2019ve been very blessed. I\u2019ve had some really great assistants, but I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going in for.\u201d Joey King: \u201cI grew up with older sisters, and that\u2019s like basically being born into assistanthood. So I think I\u2019d be a very good assistant. Kathy Bates (as Leila Ford): \u201cLooks like BuzzFeed\u2019s Hunkiest Brunette\u2018s coming for Christmas.\u201d Nicole Kidman (as Brooke Harwood): \u201cYou want him more than me.\u201d Kathy Bates (as Leila Ford): \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cA Family Affair\u201d is streaming now on Netflix.

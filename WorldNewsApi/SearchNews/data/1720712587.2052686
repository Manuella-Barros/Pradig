{"id": 232052828, "title": "NCP was offered MoS Independent rank, not Cabinet berth: Ajit Pawar", "text": "Mumbai, June 9 (IANS) Nationalist Congress Party President and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday clarified that his party had not joined the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Ministry as the BJP had offered his party a berth of Minister of State (Independent Charge) though it had requested a cabinet rank position. The party decided not to settle for the MoS (Independent Charge) post as it had unanimously recommended its Working President Praful Patel\u2019s name for minister and he had been a Cabinet minister in the past. Pawar, however, made it clear that the NCP would continue to be in the NDA and its support will continue in future too. \u201cThe party had taken a decision that Working President Praful Patel would represent it in the Union Cabinet. However, during discussions, BJP leaders Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah and JP Nadda communicated that NDA allies have been offered the MoS (Independent Charge). Praful Patel had worked as a Cabinet minister earlier and it would have been his demotion. The BJP leaders indicated that it would not be possible to accommodate Patel in the Cabinet as other allies have been offered MoS (Independent (Charge). BJP leaders, however, said that our request will be considered during expansion. Therefore, it was decided that the NCP will not join the cabinet but will continue to support the NDA,\u201d he said. Patel also echoed Pawar, saying: \u201cThere is some little bit of misunderstanding created because yesterday night we had got information that the NCP will get MoS (Independent Charge) which Maharashtra Dy CM Devendra Fadnavis also clarified. It is in line with what was offered to other alliance partners. The only difference is that I, having been a Cabinet minister in the Union government in the past, did have a reservation to accept the MoS (Independent Charge) as it would be for me personally coming down or demotion. So we have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait for a few days, and they will take remedial measures. If that is the line the BJP has taken, it does not mean that we should say immediately that there is some problem.\u2019\u201d Patel, who was accompanied by BJP General Secretary Vinod Tawde, underlined that \u201cBoth of us are working hand in hand as we are here.\u201d Earlier, Fadnavis confirmed that the NCP was offered one berth \u2013 of MoS (Independent Charge). \u201cBut they had said that they had finalised the name of Praful Patel, who was already a Cabinet minister. Therefore, he would not be able to hold the post of MoS (Independent Charge. When a government is formed with an alliance some criteria need to be decided, because several sides are together\u2026 Because of one party, the criteria cannot be twisted. There will be expansion\u2026 at that time, the NCP will be remembered,\u201d he said. Even though Pawar and Patel have made the party\u2019s stand clear, there is an impression within the cadres that it was done intentionally, especially against the backdrop of NCP\u2019s dismal performance in the just concluded general elections. Patel\u2019s induction would have given a signal to critics, especially the NCP-SP which was ridiculing the NCP for not figuring in the Cabinet. Further, a ministerial berth to Patel would have also given a partial boost for NCP to step up its efforts for consolidation especially in the run-up to the Maharashtra Assembly elections slated for September-October this year. \u2013IANS sj/vd", "summary": "<p>Mumbai, June 9 (IANS) Nationalist Congress Party President and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday clarified that his party had not joined the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/ncp-was-offered-mos-independent-rank-not-cabinet-berth-ajit-pawar/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">NCP was offered MoS Independent rank, not Cabinet berth: Ajit Pawar</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/ncp-was-offered-mos-independent-rank-not-cabinet-berth-ajit-pawar/\">NCP was offered MoS Independent rank, not Cabinet berth: Ajit Pawar</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/ncp-was-offered-mos-independent-rank-not-cabinet-berth-ajit-pawar/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202406093172887.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:49:10", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.316}

[+] gestures as he attends the Viva Technology conference d(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) Getty Images I have been exhausted for a long time with Twitter, which became \u2018X\u2019 under Elon Musk\u2019s takeover, something that essentially no one calls or will ever call the site. Twitter has been my primary online home for over a decade now, well-suited for writers who need to summarize thoughts in shortform, along with share their work and interact with their audience in a non-photo or video-based way like Instagram or YouTube. But now? It\u2019s crumbling, and every day it just seems to get worse. I am starting to lose track of all the ways the site has declined under Musk, so let\u2019s just make a list, shall we? I can no longer embed tweets in my articles \u2013 This began after Twitter changed its URLs to point to X.com instead of Twitter.com. I used to be able to past a tweet link in our CMS and have it auto-fill the embedded tweet. Now that\u2019s broken and our team must work to fix it. I can no longer post links as tweets alone \u2013 In the past few months, half the time on my articles, my \u201ctitle card\u201d has broken when I post a link. This is the image you click on to take you to an article that also shows the headline. Now it often does not show up at all, forcing me to upload a picture with every link tweet so something is there. But that picture, when clicked on, does not take people to my article. I can no longer tweet screenshots or video from video game consoles \u2013 Because of Twitter massively raising its prices for API access, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have all now done away with the ability to tweet screenshots directly from PlayStation, Microsoft and Switch respectively. Now you have to do a convoluted process like uploading a photo to a separate app and tweeting it from there instead.

But the blue check for \u201cnotable\u201d figures used to actually be a useful feature on the site both for myself and browsing through accounts to pick out specific types of figures, be they celebrities, content creators, politicians, writers or what have you. Now, the blue check is nothing but a revenue stream for X, instantly negating its entire purpose. I could pay for it, sure, but with its usefulness lost there is simply no reason to. Except\u2026 Blue checks swarming replies \u2013 One thing buying a blue check gets you is elevating your reply to the top of a thread. This used to usually be based on comment quality/likes etc, but now if you have a check, chances are you will rocket up to the top no matter how bad your take is. This has affected my own page, but it has made browsing the replies of any big account effectively worthless as its full of verified bot replies just saying things like \u201cwow!\u201d and \u201cso cool!\u201d You have to scroll for five minutes to see anything even a little worthwhile. And speaking of bots... Invasion of the \u201cnudes in bio\u201d bots \u2013 This is easily one the most bizarre, bad things to happen to the site. Elon\u2019s entire justification for so many changes to Twitter, including the paid verification process, has been to curb bots on the site. But while there might be fewer crypto bots in his replies now, there are now porn bots telling users there are \u201cnudes in their bios\u201d under almost every tweet. Those have escalated into posts of actual hardcore pornography in time and for months now, absolutely nothing has stopped this from happening and if anything, it\u2019s only getting worse. Twitter Twitter Paid engagement farming \u2013 Ah, I forgot one other aspect of buying a blue check, that you can earn money on Twitter based on your interactions with\u2026other blue checks. Now, in order to try to earn any significant amount of cash (and payouts are often comically low) we have direct financial motivation for people to give controversial or outright terrible takes in order to engage thousands or millions of users to try to get themselves paid, drastically reducing the quality of conversation on the site which has already been going down even before that, and was not ideal in the pre-Elon era, certainly. Harassment \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s simply been amplified to an almost unsustainable degree. With the site\u2019s trust and safety department dismantled there are few avenues for meaningful recourse against harassers and by unbanning some of the worst people on the site in mass quantities, Elon has all but encouraged this in the name of \u201cfree speech.\u201d The death of real-time news \u2013 Twitter used to be the place to go during a breaking news story, but the combination of a terrible news/search algorithm and the spread of pure misinformation, it has become an increasingly unreliable and hard to use place to follow live updates in most breaking situations. AI expansion \u2013 Twitter now has an entire button dedicated to \u201cGrok,\u201d its AI with Elon\u2019s sense of humor. But past that, Twitter is now using AI to summarize trends on the site, often inaccurately, as AI is known to do.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images Follower growth and engagement has stalled \u2013 My follower growth has simply slowed to an absolute crawl. I was getting a few thousand new followers a month before this, but now? On an average day I might gain 60 followers and lose 50, presumably bots or people simply unfollowing or deleting their accounts. Sure, maybe my takes are getting worse, but this is not specific to me, and is a common issue with countless users on the site, even with Elon acolytes on the right who have routinely complained about poor engagement and follower growth. It\u2019s both the algorithm and people just being turned off to the site and leaving, it seems. X \u2013 Calling Twitter X is possibly the worst rebrand in tech history. No one other that Elon fanboys or AI-bro marketing types are calling it that with a straight face. And yet, I\u2019m still using it. There is no true alternative, no matter how much people want Threads or BlueSky or Mastodon to happen. Despite its decay, I have built this account for 15 years and I can\u2019t just walk away until the lights go off. And despite everything, that does not appear to be happening any time soon. I emailed Twitter for comment, and got an instant \u201cBusy now, check back later\u201d reply from the press email. Another point for the list. Follow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram.

On a warm day in August, Anthony Stewart hiked through a forest on Washington\u2019s Olympic Peninsula, making his way through a tangle of ferns and grasses. Wispy, lichen-coated branches hung overhead, providing shade as he set down his backpack and shovel, and he and his team prepared to dig. This was one of Stewart\u2019s favorite study sites, he says. It\u2019s relatively dry on the surface, but just underneath it, a layer of reddish soil, full of organic matter, gives way to gray-blue, claylike soil. These layers, formed over time as water flooded the area, are signs of a wetland. But like many forested wetlands in the Pacific Northwest, this area doesn\u2019t appear on any state maps. In a study published in Nature Communications this past January, Stewart, a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, and his team reported the surprising abundance of unmapped, carbon-rich wetlands in the Pacific Northwest\u2019s forests. The scientists studied the Hoh River watershed, which snakes westward across the Olympic Peninsula, documenting potential wetlands that, because of the thick forest canopy, were invisible to satellite imaging. Including them in estimates of the watershed\u2019s carbon-storage capacity increased them by fivefold. Conserving forested wetlands not only protects valuable habitat; it could help stabilize the climate. But first, the wetlands must be put on the map\u2014and that is no easy task. Wetland ecosystems are stunningly effective at soaking up carbon from the atmosphere. Despite covering only less than 10 percent of the world\u2019s land surface, they contain roughly 20 to 30 percent of the carbon stored in the soil. And because the plant matter in the waterlogged soil decays slowly, their carbon tends to stay put. Wetlands provide other benefits too: Some 40 percent of all animal and plant species rely on wetlands. The gnarled roots of wetland trees and plants purify water, and the wetland soils absorb it, providing flood protection to nearby areas. Since the 1920s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has surveyed the types and quality of soil throughout the nation. But until recently, these soil maps focused primarily on agricultural land, leaving out most forests and thus huge gaps in knowledge about the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. On top of that, \u201cwetlands were not at all a focus in forested landscapes,\u201d says David D\u2019Amore, a soil scientist with the USDA Forest Service and a co-author of the study. To identify these hidden forested wetlands and estimate their carbon content, the researchers used the Wetland Intrinsic Potential (WIP) tool, a wetland-mapping tool that uses LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, an aerial remote-sensing technique that can resolve details underneath the tree canopy. The researchers then randomly selected 36 sampling sites across the entire Hoh River watershed, many of which were far from any sort of trail. Armed with shovels, hoses, and pumps, the researchers drove along bumpy backcountry roads and bushwhacked their way through thick woods. Once they arrived at their sampling locations, they used shovels to dig three-foot-deep holes in the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s really intensive to get a carbon measurement,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy path.\u201d The team scooped the soil into gallon-size plastic bags and carried it back to the University of Washington. In the laboratory, Stewart ground the samples to a fine powder and heated them to 1,000 degrees Celsius (about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit). At that temperature, the carbon-containing substances in the soil were completely decomposed and transformed into carbon dioxide, allowing the scientists to measure its carbon content. Finally, the researchers combined the soil-carbon data with remote-sensing topography information to create a model of the amount of soil carbon that is stored across the watershed. \u201cWe just rediscovered these really carbon-rich forested wetland areas that weren\u2019t being mapped by the currently available land data sets,\u201d Stewart says. In the 2016 National Wetland Condition Assessment, a federal survey of the nation\u2019s wetlands, Amanda Nahlik, an ecologist and biogeochemist in the Office of Research and Development at the Environmental Protection Agency, concluded that wetlands in the West held about 6 percent of the total carbon stored by wetlands in the Lower 48. \u201cWe recognized we were probably underestimating the amount of carbon stored in the West,\u201d she says. Stewart\u2019s study confirmed this hunch. \u201cThere is this landscape that\u2019s uncharacterized that we need to start to target,\u201d Stewart says. In general, wetlands aren\u2019t faring well. Half of the wetlands in the Lower 48 have disappeared since the 1780s, and, over the past decade, the rate of wetland loss has doubled, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s most recent National Wetlands Inventory. Roughly half of the wetlands in the Mountain West are in poor condition. Though there are thought to be fewer wetlands in the arid West than on the East Coast, \u201cthat does not mean that those wetlands are less important,\u201d says Megan Lang, the inventory\u2019s chief scientist. \u201cIn fact, it might mean that those wetlands are more important, because there are fewer of them.\u201d The two main drivers of wetland loss in the West, Lang says, are drought and cattle grazing. Climate change, which is expected to increase aridity in the West, could dry up huge portions of the region\u2019s remaining wetlands by 2050. And when wetlands are destroyed, their carbon is often released into the atmosphere, further worsening global warming. Last year\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency changed the federal definition of a wetland under the Clean Water Act, disqualifying thousands of miles of ephemeral streams and millions of acres of wetlands\u2014including those along the Hoh River\u2014from protection under that law. Some federal and state initiatives are attempting to compensate: Late last month, President Joe Biden announced a goal to protect 8 million acres of wetlands over the next six years. And earlier this month, Colorado became the first state to pass legislation protecting the wetlands excluded by last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision. Lang emphasizes that it\u2019s crucial to map, measure, and conserve the wetlands we still have: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to maintain resilience to climate change, if we are going to have clean water for the future, if we\u2019re going to keep feeding our families, if we are going to be safe from flooding, we are going to need to do better in terms of wetland conservation.\u201d", "summary": "The ecosystem is a weapon against climate change\u2014and huge swaths of it have long been ignored.", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/05/wetlands-forest-unmapped-carbon-washington/678513/", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/hkE1Sxy2dmP2J-Sf8133o2VPMyY=/0x64:2995x1624/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/05/2JCC788/original.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:00", "author": "Natalia Mesa", "authors": ["Natalia Mesa"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.147}

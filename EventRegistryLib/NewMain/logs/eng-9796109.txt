However, in her complaint, she notes that the fact that he found the Malibu home at all is troubling. She says it's hard to find and hasn't been advertised as much as her primary residence. This could indicate Conley's need to contact her family.\n\nConley allegedly broke into Roberts' home on May 7 or 8 and called her cell phone. She spoke to him after thinking it was family calling her. A judge later granted a five-year restraining order against Conley; pictured in NYC in November\n\nConley has already visited Kris Jenner's home and also tried to climb a fence at Kim's Malibu home, which is not her primary residence\n\nRoberts and Kardashian's working relationship doesn't end with AHS. The two are co-producers on Netflix's upcoming series Calabasas; pictured on AHS: Delicate\n\nHe claimed he told guards who stopped him at the fence surrounding his home that he planned to climb over it.\n\nRoberts eventually managed to obtain a five-year restraining order against Conley.\n\nThe order also provides the same protections for her 3-year-old son Rhodes Robert Hedlund, whom she shares with her ex, actor Garrett Hedlund. Conley alleged that he mentioned his name during the phone call with Roberts, causing her to fear he intended to harm her son.\n\nRoberts' well-received collaboration with Kardashian on American Horror Story: Delicate won't be their only project together, as the two are also producers on the upcoming Netflix series Calabasas.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emma Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kris Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_Up_with_the_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story:_Delicate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Horror Story: Delicate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hedlund", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Hedlund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabasas,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kim-Kardashian-files-for-restraining-order-against-alleged-stalker-after.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796109", "eventUri": "eng-9796109", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-07", "textStart": 2959, "textEnd": 2964}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

The reality TV star is living in fear after a man started showing up at her home uninvited.\n\nThe situation takes a sinister turn as the same individual is accused of previously harassing actress Emma Roberts, creating a chilling connection between the two stars.\n\nAlthough Kim Kardashian is no stranger to attention, this alarming situation underscores the relentless and dangerous behavior of this individual.\n\nAccording to legal documents, the terrifying ordeal began when Roberts reached out to Kardashian, revealing that a home intruder had confessed to harboring a disturbing fixation on the Kardashian-West clan.\n\nThe individual allegedly expressed a sinister desire to connect with Kardashian and her children.\n\nGiven their close working relationship on both \"American Horror Story: Delicate\" and their upcoming Netflix project, \"Calabasas,\" the two stars share a deep bond and mutual concern for each other's safety.\n\nIn the court filing obtained by TMZ, Kardashian is requesting a restraining order against Melvin Jeffery Conley. She emphasized that her Malibu home is neither easy to locate nor publicized, indicating the lengths Conley is willing to go to reach her and her kids.\n\nThe reality TV star stated that Conley's actions caused her significant \"worry, concern and severe emotional distress.\"\n\nKardashian intensified her legal efforts to protect her family from a persistent stalker after he found her home. Following an alarming incident where Conley allegedly broke into Roberts' home, he then appeared at Kris Jenner's residence.\n\nHe claimed he was Kardashian's \"long-time manager\" and a player for the Toronto Raptors. Conley then allegedly insisted he had an appointment to meet with the actress that day.\n\nConley did not stop there. He reportedly showed up at Kardashian's Malibu home, which was the last straw for the star. Security intercepted him along the perimeter fence, where he declared his intention to jump over. Fortunately, security managed to thwart his attempt.\n\nRoberts was left reeling in May after she and her young son were forced to seek temporary refuge after a harrowing home invasion and subsequent stalking incidents.\n\nCourt documents obtained by The Blast revealed that Roberts \"secured and locked\" her home before leaving California in early May. However, during her absence, an intruder identified as Melvin Jeffery Conley managed to break into her residence.\n\nThe situation escalated when Conley used the actress's landline to call her cell phone, confirming his presence inside the house. Overcome with fear and uncertainty, Roberts immediately contacted authorities.\n\nDespite their swift response, Conley \"has eluded arrest and continues to send me disturbing text messages. I am in sustained fear and am afraid to return to my own home,\" the actress lamented.\n\nIn response to her filing, Roberts and her child were granted a temporary restraining order against Melvin Jeffery Conley, an alleged stalker who broke into her home and made threatening contact.\n\nUnder the terms of the restraining order, Conley must not \"harass, intimidate, molest, attack, strike, stalk, threaten, assault (sexually or otherwise), hit, abuse, destroy personal property of, or disturb the peace\" of Roberts or her child.\n\nTo ensure the safety of the singer and her family, the restraining order also prohibits Conley from contacting Roberts or her child in any form. This includes in-person communication, phone calls, mail, emails, text messages, faxes, and any other electronic means.\n\nAdditionally, Conley is required to stay at least 100 yards away from Roberts, her residence, her workplace, and her child's school. This order effectively created a protective buffer zone around them.\n\nWhile the recent incident involving another stalker has dominated headlines, this is not the first time the reality TV star has faced such threats.\n\nIn November 2022, The Blast shared that Kardashian sought legal protection after an individual repeatedly showed up at her home, claiming to have a business to discuss.\n\nDespite not knowing the man, Kardashian had her security team ask him to leave. However, the stalker remained undeterred and even mentioned carrying a gun after being turned away by her bodyguards. In her declaration, Kardashian detailed the unsettling encounters, stating:\n\n\"I am informed that (the person) attempted to access my residence on three separate occasions in August 2022. He presented a letter seeking to be my business partner. I am informed that he stated he traveled to CA for the purpose of meeting me. I have never contacted him. He expressed his frustration that I had not responded to him.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how effectively the Temporary Restraining Order will shield Kim Kardashian from further harassment.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afouda_bamidele@theblast.com", "name": "Afouda Bamidele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emma Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stalking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Malibu, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Horror_Story:_Delicate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Horror Story: Delicate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabasas,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kris Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/1302x602/2024/08/06180444/Portraits-Of-Emma-Roberts-And-Kim-Kardashian.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796109", "eventUri": "eng-9796109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Roberts reportedly phoned Kardashian to warn her that Conley had entered her home and he was going to attempt making contact with Kardashian and her children. The man allegedly showed up at the home of Kardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, the very next day.\n\nRoberts claimed that Conley broke into her home in May and used her landline phone to call her on her cell phone, according to TMZ. The famous actress said she missed the call but noticed the number was from inside her home, so she thought it was a family member trying to reach her. She called her residential line and was stunned to hear a stranger on the other end of the phone. Conley allegedly answered and said she had given him permission to stay at her house, which she denied, according to TMZ.\n\nConley allegedly went to Jenner's home the very next day and attempted to gain entry by telling her security agents that he thought he was at Kardashian's home. He claimed he was Kardashian's \"long-time manager,\" a player with the Toronto Raptors and that he had a scheduled appointment with Kardashian that day, according to TMZ.\n\nThe alleged stalker arrived at Kardashian's Malibu home in July and was confronted by her security by the time he made it to the perimeter fence, according to TMZ. He allegedly told security he was going to jump the fence to gain entry but they managed to prevent him from doing so.\n\nKim's legal documents noted her Malibu residence is not publicized and is difficult to locate, which sparked concern over Conley's alleged determination and ability to get so close to her and her children.\n\nShe claimed she was overcome by \"worry, concern and severe emotional distress\" as a result of Conley's behavior, according to TMZ.\n\nRoberts successfully obtained a 5-year restraining order against Conley.

She ministered to her parents and her husband as they neared the end of their lives. Her care of animals was so good that Gabby, a member of the call duck species, lived with her for 22 years, way beyond a duck's average life span.\n\n\"She had a love of life and just had a beautiful spirit about her,\" said her cousin, Donna Murphy Turner. \"You always felt welcome. She gave us all a greater appreciation of life, of love, of beauty and nature.\"\n\nConley, who spent her last years enjoying the birds in the inlet and trees outside her kitchen window, died July 23 due to complications from a heart procedure in June. The Babylon resident was 84.\n\nAs a child, she helped her mother feed ducks in the waters by their home, her family said.\n\nAs a parent, she presided over a household of animal rescues and lovers, with key support from husband and Suffolk County policeman, Karl Patrick Conley, who founded his department's K-9 section in the 1960s.\n\nThe couple's connection was \"instantaneous\" when they met as teenagers during a dance hosted by their Catholic schools, then eloped as college students two years later in 1959, said her daughter, Kathleen Conley of Silver Spring, Maryland. They had three children born over the course of two and a half years, she said.\n\n\"They were always in sync on what to do and when,\" the daughter said.\n\nElizabeth Conley got a license as a veterinary technician in the 1980s, leaving the field a few years later to focus on wildlife. Treating animals from her home for about 35 years, she specialized in water birds but responded to various calls, including an eagle stuck on tar on a roof, her family said.\n\nHer house was a haven where songbirds, squirrels, geese, seagulls, ducks and other animals recovered. Most of the waterfowl stayed in the garage or outside pens and splashed in a heated, in-ground pond, but visitors might see a duck in the bathtub or mistake a kitchen bowl of duck pellets as human food.\n\n\"She did recognize the different personalities between the ducks so that was pretty funny,\" Kathleen Conley recounted. \"In the winter, she'd be out there feeding them in the pens, changing their water, making sure there's no ice so they could drink and swim.\n\n\"A lot of the baby geese and ducks she had raised, that had lost their mothers ... would come back every single year. They would actually walk up to us.\"\n\nFamily and friends also admired Elizabeth Conley as a self-taught woman, especially in the arts. She painted her patients, including garden scenes with ducks and songbirds, on the walls of her home. If her knitted and crocheted sweaters and gifts weren't perfect, she would redo them. She kept the Christmas tree up year-round, decorating for various holidays and seasons.\n\nWell-read, she held online chats with LGBTQ authors at a time when chats were a new phenomenon. She also wrote and edited the Beakly News, a newsletter for birders.\n\nConley loved going on birding trips, but in later years, as her health made getting around difficult, longtime friend Lynn Simmons, of Babylon, would stop by most Fridays for lunch. The birder would easily identify all the birds spotted outside from the kitchen table, and Simmons would share her travel tales to her interested audience.\n\n\"Not only would she read my journal entries, but she would be interested in where I'd been and what I'd done and what I've seen,\" Simmons said. \"Not everybody does that. She was a wonderful listener.\"\n\nBesides her daughter, Elizabeth Conley is also survived by sons, Karl Conley Jr., of East Islip, and John Conley, of West Babylon.\n\nElizabeth Conley never wanted people to be sad, her daughter said, so instead of a wake and service, a celebration of her life will be held this month, followed by a private burial next to her late husband in the fall.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anseriformes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anseriformes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babylon"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellet_(ornithology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pellet (ornithology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Songbird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Suffolk County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Spring,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver Spring, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Silver Spring, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas tree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Babylon,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Babylon, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Babylon, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Islip,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Islip, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Islip, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:NTQ4ODhhNWEtM2M2MS00:Y2E1OWE5/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796109", "eventUri": "eng-9796109", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 801, "textEnd": 808}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

In court docs obtained by TMZ on Tuesday, The Kardashians star claims to have received a call from her AHS: Delicate co-star warning her about a man who'd broken into Emma's house and expressed a desire to find Kim and her four kids.\n\nUmmm, hell to the NO!\n\nThe man, identified in the docs as Melvin Jeffery Conley, allegedly broke into Emma's house back in May and used her home phone to call her cell phone. Luckily she wasn't home at the time, and while Emma apparently missed the call, she gave a ring back assuming it was one of her family members... But Melvin was the one to answer. According to TMZ, he claimed Emma gave him permission to use her house, which she denied.\n\nSo creepy.\n\nBefore cops could arrive at the scene, he was gone. And a day later, he showed up at Kris Jenner's compound. There, he attempted to tell security guards that he thought it was Kim's house, and that he had a scheduled meeting with the reality star. According to the filings, he even attempted to sell himself as Kim's \"long-term manager,\" and an NBA player for the Toronto Raptors.\n\nRelated: Details Of Swimming Incident Zac Efron Was Hospitalized For REVEALED!\n\nTHEN, just last month, he showed up outside of Kim's Malibu mansion, which is not her primary place of residence. He told security guards there he was going to jump the fence. Thankfully, that did not happen.\n\nThe SKKN founder expressed concern over Melvin locating her Malibu home in her legal filings as the location has not been as publicized as her more primary residence, and that it shows he's serious about making contact with her and her children.\n\nAbsolutely chilling.\n\nKim claims his attempts to find her have left her with \"worry, concern and severe emotional distress.\" We bet! It's not just her he's messing with, it's her kids, too! It doesn't get scarier than that!\n\nEmma was able to snag a five-year restraining order against him, so let's hope Kim can easily get one, too.\n\nWhat are your thoughts??

Many Jewish students have felt intimidated by protests, which have at times included antisemitic tropes and calls for anti-Jewish violence.\n\nA small group of pro-Palestinian protesters waving Palestinian flags stood along the side of the road as participants marched with Israeli flags from the site of Auschwitz in the Polish town of Oswiecim to the site of Birkenau about 3 kilometers (2 miles) away. The area was under German occupation during World War II and today the former death camps are preserved as memorials by the Polish state.\n\n\"Through this protest we want to say that we bow down to the victims of the Holocaust too,\" said Omar Faris, president of an association of Palestinians in Poland. \"At the same time, we demand an end to war, an end to genocide.\"\n\nThe march took place on what is Holocaust Remembrance Day in the Jewish calendar. A grim landscape of watchtowers and barracks were filled with the blue and white of Israeli flags, a celebration of Jewish survival at the place of genocide.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive also joined.\n\nJudith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, had long avoided visiting Auschwitz. But she was inspired to join this year's march after her kibbutz fended off an attack by Hamas on Oct. 7\n\n\"See, I try not to remember it all the time. But on the 7th of October they brought me the remembrance very, very harshly back,\" she told The Associated Press at the site of the former death camp. \"And that's the moment when I decided, OK, this is the time you should go to Auschwitz to see it.\"\n\nAmid the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests that have roiled American campuses, Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York, led a delegation of leaders from Catholic, Evangelical and historically Black colleges and universities.\n\n\"The message here is clear. The dangers of allowing hate to go unchecked are real. And we don't need to get to the cattle cars in order for it to be unconscionable and unacceptable,\" he said, referring to the cattle cars used to transport Jews to their deaths at camps under German wartime occupation.\n\nHe said it was essential for university leaders \"to call out, and in no uncertain terms, when there is intimidation and hate and antisemitism. We're seeing it on campuses and college campuses, and it needs to have a response.\"\n\nSome who had planned to attend had to cancel to deal with the protests at home, Berman told the AP, though he

Israel and its supporters have branded the protests as antisemitic, while critics of Israel say it uses such allegations to silence opponents.\n\nWhile some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nIn the Polish town of Oswiecim, a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters waving Palestinian flags stood along the side of the road as participants marched with Israeli flags from the Auschwitz site in the Polish town of Oswiecim to that of Birkenau about 3 kilometers (2 miles) away. The area was under German occupation during World War II and today the former death camps are preserved as memorials by the Polish state.\n\n\"Through this protest we want to say that we bow down to the victims of the Holocaust too,\" said Omar Faris, president of an association of Palestinians in Poland. \"At the same time, we demand an end to war, an end to genocide.\"\n\nThe march took place on what is Holocaust Remembrance Day in the Jewish calendar. A grim landscape of watchtowers and barracks were filled with the blue and white of Israeli flags, a celebration of Jewish survival at the place of genocide.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive also joined.\n\nJudith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, had long avoided visiting Auschwitz. But she was inspired to join this year's march after her kibbutz fended off an attack by Hamas on Oct. 7\n\n\"See, I try not to remember it all the time. But on the 7th of October they brought me the remembrance very, very harshly back,\" she told The Associated Press at the site of the former death camp. \"And that was a moment when I decided, 'okay, this is the time you should go to Auschwitz.' To see it, even to myself, to remember it again.\"\n\nAmid the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests that have roiled American campuses, Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York, led a delegation of leaders from Catholic, Evangelical and historically Black colleges and universities.\n\n\"The message here is clear. The dangers of allowing hate to go unchecked are real. And we don't need to get to the cattle cars in order for it to be unconscionable and unacceptable,\" he said, referring to the cattle cars used to transport Jews to their deaths at camps under German wartime occupation.\n\nHe said it was essential for university leaders \"to call out, and in no uncertain terms, when there is intimidation and hate and antisemitism. We're seeing it on campuses and college campuses, and it needs to have a response.\"\n\nSome who had planned to attend had to cancel to deal with the protests at home, Berman told the AP, though he

In response to Monday's protest, its organisers said: \"We marched today to give a voice to the six million victims of the Nazi's industrial genocide of the Jewish people.\n\n\"We marched with survivors of the Nazi atrocities as well as survivors of Hamas's crimes and families of those still held in captivity.\n\n\"The half a dozen protesters who perversely saw this as an opportunity to voice hatred against Israel and the Jewish people serve as a timely reminder of the importance of Holocaust education and remembrance and of teaching the dangers of hatred and extremism.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_badge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yellow badge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invasion of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israelites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "March of the Living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extermination camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kKP7w2sXk64ssr8TREBXBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/6103c5b360699d3bdf4073c3a5a92442", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543219", "eventUri": "eng-9543219", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 300, "textEnd": 305}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

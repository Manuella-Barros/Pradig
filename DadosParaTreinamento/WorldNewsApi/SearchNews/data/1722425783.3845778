During an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast, the 51-year-old actor reflected on leaving the ABC medical drama after starring as Dr. Mark Sloan (a.k.a. McStreamy) for six seasons from 2006 to 2012. \"I didn't leave so much as I think I was let go,\" he admitted to host Dax Shepard. When Shepard, 49, noted the actor was \u201cstruggling\u201d with drug and alcohol addiction at that point, Dane responded, \u201cI was struggling. They didn't let me go because of that, although it definitely didn't help.\" Dane clarified that he believes that he was let go from the series \u2014 which was renewed for a 21st season in April \u2014 due to financial reasons. \"I was starting to become \u2014 as most of these actors who have spent significant time on the show \u2014 you start to become very expensive for the network,\" he claimed. \"And the network knows that the show is going to do what it's going to do irrespective of who they keep on it\u2014as long as they have their Grey they were fine.\" He continued: \"I wasn't the same guy they had hired, so I had understood when I was let go and [show creator] Shonda [Rhimes] was really great.\u201d Dane went on to praise Rhimes\u2019 handling of the situation, saying, \"She protected us fiercely. She protected us publicly, she protected us privately... I love Shonda Rhimes and she protected me but I was probably fired. It wasn't ceremoniously like, 'You're fired,' it was just like, 'You're not coming back.'\" ABC did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. Dane revealed that he was sober for \u201cthree or four years\u201d before landing the role on Grey\u2019s Anatomy but ultimately relapsed during the Writers Guild of America Strike in 2007. \"If you take the whole eight years I was on Grey's Anatomy, I was f---ed up longer than I was sober and that was when things started going sideways for me,\" he added.

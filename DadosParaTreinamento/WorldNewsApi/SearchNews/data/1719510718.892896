The 33-year-old law school grad had recently quit his job at the district attorney\u2019s office and was trying to start his own magazine. His mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and his best friend, cousin Anthony Radziwill, were diagnosed with cancer in the same month. And he was in a tumultuous relationship with Daryl Hannah, the sultry star of the mermaid movie \u201cSplash\u201d and the daughter of a billionaire. Yet, Kennedy could not stop thinking about Carolyn Bessette, a 28-year-old blonde who worked in fashion. He had met her about a year and a half ago and had dated her on and off \u2014 mostly off \u2014 since then. But he admitted to an old friend that she was \u201chaving a heavy effect on him.\u201d \u201cWell, she\u2019s not really anybody,\u201d he said when this pal pressed him for more details. \u201cShe\u2019s some functionary of Calvin Klein\u2019s \u2026 She\u2019s an ordinary person.\u201d Bessette was not rich, not famous, not from an esteemed family nor Ivy League school. Yet this \u201cordinary\u201d woman ended up snagging JFK Jr., America\u2019s prince, the second son of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jackie and \u2014 per People magazine \u2014 the \u201csexiest man alive.\u201d They married in 1996. Their wedding, on a remote island off the coast of Georgia, was like something out of a fairy tale. Except, as Elizabeth Beller writes in her new book, \u201cOnce Upon A Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy\u201d (Gallery Books, out now), it was more like a nightmare. The tabloids dubbed Bessette an \u201cice queen,\u201d \u201cgold digger,\u201d \u201ccoke head,\u201d and \u201ccheater.\u201d The paparazzi hounded her, yelling obscenities at her as she left the Tribeca loft she shared with hubby \u201cJohn John.\u201d She went on antidepressants; she was scared to leave the house. Even after the couple\u2019s tragic death in a plane crash in 1999, Bessette remained an elusive, distant figure. At best, she was exalted as a \u201890s fashion plate, thanks to her minimalist chic. At worst, she was blamed for her husband\u2019s untimely demise: Their ill-fated plane was supposedly delayed because she made her pedicurist change her nail polish three times. In fact, Beller reports, she got to the airport at the same time as her husband and sister Lauren, who also perished in the crash. \u201cThere seemed to be a need to deprive her of nuance and humanity,\u201d writes Beller in the introduction. \u201cAs though she were required to play a villain role in a larger cultural narrative.\u201d \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d aims to paint a more flattering portrait. \u201cI wanted to recount Carolyn\u2019s story in a way that situated her at the center of her own narrative,\u201d Beller writes. \u201cWhen she appears in volumes of Kennedy literature, it is often as a sidebar without empathy, compassion or desire to understand who she really was. It\u2019s time she got her due.\u201d Carolyn Bessette was born Jan. 7, 1966, the youngest of three girls. Her parents divorced when she was 8, but her schoolteacher mother remarried a few years later, and the family moved from middle-class White Plains, NY, to tony Greenwich, Conn. Bessette studied education at Boston University, but landed a job assisting VIP clients at Calvin Klein after graduation. One of those clients was JFK Jr. The two met during a fitting in 1992. He was charmed by her poise and wit. He left with several suits and her number. The romance was rocky from the start. He invited her to a gala dinner \u2014 and then showed up with another woman. Another time, he arrived two hours late to dinner, and she threw a glass of wine in his face. He broke up with her after he received a letter from a friend claiming Bessette was a \u201cuser\u201d and \u201cpartier\u201d who \u201cdated guys around town\u201d and was \u201cout for fame and fortune.\u201d (He rekindled his romances with Daryl Hannah and model Julie Baker; she rebounded with her ex, a hunky Calvin Klein model.) \u201cCarolyn was upset, but not despondent,\u201d one of her friends tells Beller about that incident. \u201cShe also knew, deep down, that this would not be the end. John was a prize, and Carolyn had her eye on the ball.\u201d He came crawling back in earnest after the death of his beloved mother. Bessette, Beller writes, was the only one who could assuage his grief, and yet she remained \u201cirked\u201d that her boyfriend never introduced her to Jackie. In fact, Kennedy once squired Bessette out the side door of a restaurant when he spotted his mother across the room. \u201cDoes he think I\u2019m blind?\u201d Jackie later asked a friend. Bessette\u2019s own mother, by the way, wasn\u2019t entirely keen on her daughter\u2019s fair-weather beau. \u201cHe\u2019s sweet, but that entire scene is too much drama,\u201d she said after she met him. Still, they were drawn to each other. They got a dog; she moved into his loft. She consulted on his magazine \u201cGeorge.\u201d He proposed to her in July of 1995. She got blonder, thinner, more chic. She quit her PR job at Calvin Klein because of the attention she attracted from the paparazzi \u2014 especially after the press filmed a big fight between her and \u201cJohn John\u201d in Washington Square Park. \u201cIt\u2019s like I am a prey animal,\u201d she told a friend about the constant cameras. \u201cThey are everywhere \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I can do this.\u201d The problems only intensified after the wedding. Kennedy had a cordial relationship with the press. He had grown up in the limelight and knew how to handle them. He sympathized with his wife, but he also couldn\u2019t entirely understand her refusal to give them a smile and just go on with her life. \u201cI hate those bastards. I\u2019d rather scream and curse them,\u201d Bassette told a friend. Her refusal to engage attracted more attention. It got so bad that she once spat on a female fotog who was pursuing her. When Princess Diana died in a car crash \u2014 after being chased by the paparazzi \u2014 Bessette was, Kennedy said, \u201creally spooked.\u201d \u201cJohn and Carolyn were woefully undermanaged for their outsize life,\u201d a friend told Beller. \u201cThey needed aides-de-camp. They needed security. And they should probably have moved away from that building.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. Instead, Bessette shut herself inside: a princess trapped in her modern castle. Kennedy confessed to friends that he didn\u2019t think their marriage could last, that his wife refused to have sex with him. He was photographed with a former flame at a hotel where he sometimes spent the night after marital spats. As for the drug accusations, Beller\u2019s sources say that Bessette barely even drank wine. Kennedy \u2014 against nearly all of his family members\u2019 wishes \u2014 had begun taking flying lessons years before. He was an adrenaline junkie, and eventually bought himself a six-seater plane. Bessette largely refused to fly with him unless he had a copilot. Yet, in July 1999, she and her sister agreed to have Kennedy fly them to Cape Cod for a wedding. They never made it. Days later, a bottle of Bessette\u2019s antidepressants washed onto the shore. \u201cWe are left to wonder what form the life of beautiful, captivating Carolyn would have taken, had it not been cut so short,\u201d Beller writes. At the time of their death, Bassette and Kennedy were in couples therapy. She had talked about maybe going into psychology, or doing documentary films. Things seemed to be looking slightly up. Yet, Bessette herself seemed to know she couldn\u2019t quite cut it. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do something soon,\u201d she half-joked to a friend, \u201cI\u2019m going to end up in a trailer park screaming, \u2018I used to be married to JFK Jr.\u2019\u201d", "summary": "The fairy tale wasn't all it seemed.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/lifestyle/truth-of-carolyn-bessette-and-jfk-jr-s-marriage-revealed/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/once-upon-a-time.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:00", "author": "Raquel Laneri", "authors": ["Raquel Laneri"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.148}

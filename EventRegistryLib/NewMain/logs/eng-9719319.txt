Clemishire said Morris told her to come see him in his room before bed, and she was the type of girl who listened to instructions from trusted adults.\n\nBut 25 years later, when Clemishire hired an attorney and threatened to sue Morris, accusing him of repeatedly molesting her as a child, a lawyer representing Morris responded by blaming Clemishire for what happened to her, according to 2007 correspondence obtained by NBC News.\n\n\"It was your client,\" wrote lawyer J. Shelby Sharpe, referring to Clemishire at age 12, \"who initiated inappropriate behavior by coming into my client's bedroom and getting in bed with him, which my client should not have allowed to happen.\"\n\nFor more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News with Lester Holt\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nThe Feb. 6, 2007, letter was one in a series of exchanges that year between Sharpe and Gentner Drummond, a lawyer who represented Clemishire at the time. Clemishire said in an interview last week she had been seeking $50,000 in restitution from Morris to cover the cost of counseling. Morris, through his lawyer, instead offered to pay $25,000, but the talks fell apart, Clemishire said, because she was not willing to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nDrummond, who is now Oklahoma's attorney general, confirmed Clemishire's description of the 2007 negotiations and declined to comment further.\n\nReached by phone Monday, Sharpe said that he had no recollection of the $25,000 settlement offer or NDA demand and that he no longer represents Morris. He denied knowing at the time that Clemishire had been a child when Morris began engaging in sexual behavior with her. However, the initial correspondence Drummond sent to him stated clearly that Clemishire was \"twelve years old\" when the abuse began.\n\n\"I don't ever remember seeing that,\" Sharpe said after a reporter read the document to him. After a reporter offered to share a copy of the messages, Sharpe said he did not have time to read them and declined to share an email address.\n\n\"I can tell you that the letters that you've seen, they speak for themselves,\" said Sharpe, who has also served as a personal attorney to Paige Patterson, a Southern Baptist Convention leader accused of mishandling or concealing sexual assaults that date back to the late 1980s. \"I will not amplify beyond those letters, because they speak for themselves.\"\n\nMorris did not respond to messages.\n\nClemishire went public with her accusations last month in a post published by the church watchdog site The Wartburg Watch. Morris responded with a statement admitting to \"inappropriate sexual behavior\" and saying he had long ago confessed and repented. Gateway Church leaders initially said Morris had been \"open and forthright about a moral failure he had over 35 years ago\" but later said they did not know Clemishire was a child at the time.\n\nWithin days, Morris resigned as senior pastor of the megachurch he started in 2000, and Gateway elders hired an outside law firm to investigate the matter.\n\nLawrence Swicegood, a Gateway spokesperson, said church leaders had not seen the 2007 letters between Drummond and Sharpe. Swicegood said that before Clemishire went public with her story last month, \"the current Elders did not have all the facts.\"\n\nWhile the internal review is underway, four Gateway officials have agreed to take leaves of absence from the board of elders, the church announced last month. One is pastor James Morris, Robert Morris' son. The three others served on the board of elders during the critical period from 2005 to 2007 when Clemishire was seeking damages.\n\n\"Gateway Church is committed to protecting people -- first and foremost children and the most vulnerable,\" Swicegood said in an email. \"Abuse simply cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nClemishire, now 54, sees the 2007 letter from Sharpe as part of a pattern of Morris and his associates' attempting to make her feel guilt and shame for what he did to her.\n\n\"They don't look at a child as someone to protect,\" Clemishire said.\n\nClemishire said she struggled for years with \"profound confusion\" over what Morris did, believing for nearly two decades that she was to blame. She said Morris molested her more than 100 times over 4\u00bd years. After the first encounter on Christmas in 1982, Clemishire said, \"it just progressed to a lot of kissing and touching and inserting fingers into my body.\" She said Morris pressured her to have intercourse, but she refused. Morris has acknowledged \"kissing and petting\" and argued that the number of incidents was a fraction of what Clemishire alleges.\n\nClemishire said that in the mid-2000s, after years of counseling and after having watched a television interview about grooming and sex abuse, she realized what happened to her was a crime.\n\nShe began writing to Morris at his Gateway Church email address in 2005, asking that he compensate her for the trauma she says he inflicted. In 2007, she hired Drummond to make a formal demand, according to documents provided to NBC News by Boz Tchividjian, the lawyer she hired last month.\n\nOn Jan. 30, 2007, Drummond wrote to Sharpe on behalf of Clemishire, using her legal name at the time, Cindy Clemishire McCaleb. Drummond detailed the sexual abuse Clemishire says she suffered from 1982 to 1987 and how Morris \"led her to believe that they were having a special relationship that had to remain secret.\"\n\n\"Morris convinced Ms. McCaleb that she was responsible for what he did to her,\" Drummond wrote, \"and he convinced her that she was the offender.\"\n\nDrummond attached a draft of a lawsuit he said Clemishire planned to file if Morris failed to respond within 15 days.\n\nSharpe responded a week later, on Feb. 6, 2007, with his letter casting Clemishire as the one who initiated sexual contact with Morris.\n\nSharpe also claimed in the letter that Clemishire \"acted inappropriately with two other men who stayed in her home between 1982 and 1987,\" when she was between the ages of 12 and 17. And Sharpe wrote that Clemishire had \"confessed her conduct\" to Glenda Faulkner, a woman who attended Shady Grove Church near Fort Worth, Texas, in the 1980s, when Morris was a pastor there.\n\nFaulkner, now Glenda Faulkner-Woodliff -- a licensed counselor who later attended Gateway -- did not respond to messages requesting comment.\n\nIn an interview, Clemishire disputed Sharpe's characterizations. She said two other men touched her inappropriately at her home when she was a child, but she said she did not initiate those interactions. In one instance, Clemishire said, it was Morris who instructed her, when she was 13, to go into a bedroom at her childhood home where another traveling evangelist was staying. Once she was inside, she said, the man, whom she declined to name, began to kiss her but eventually pulled away and told her she was too young.\n\nIn another instance, in 1986, Clemishire said, another man who was staying with her family climbed on top of her while she was sleeping on a sofa bed next to his 3-year-old daughter. She believed he planned to rape her, but she said the man suddenly got off of her.\n\n\"I really think God intervened,\" Clemishire said. \"God made him feel like someone was walking by, and he just rolled off of me and left.\"\n\nIt was that incident, Clemishire said, that eventually led her to confide in Faulkner-Woodliff, also a family friend. Faulkner-Woodliff asked whether anyone else had ever touched her that way, Clemishire said. Clemishire then reluctantly explained what Morris had done to her, she said. Afterward, Clemishire said, Faulkner-Woodliff insisted that she tell her parents.\n\nThat's how, in March 1987, her father learned that Morris had been sexually abusing her, Clemishire said. She said her father was enraged and contacted Olen Griffing, the senior pastor at Shady Grove Church, to demand that Morris step out of ministry.\n\nClemishire remembers getting a call from Morris' wife, Debbie, a few days later.\n\nDebbie told her, \"I forgive you,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll never forget that,\" Clemishire said. \"They wanted me to believe that I -- me, the child -- was responsible for what happened. And they've never stopped trying to make me believe that.\"\n\nGriffing, now in his 80s, later served as a pastor and elder under Morris at Gateway Church. He did not respond to messages.\n\nClemishire's older sister was living with her family in 1987 and corroborated Clemishire's account of conversations that took place that year among her sister, her parents, Faulkner-Woodliff, Griffing and the Morris family.\n\nIn the years since then, Morris has repeatedly told a sanitized and, at times, distorted version of the story. He has spoken often from the pulpit of struggling with sexual immorality and having to step out of ministry in 1987. But in public tellings, he says sinful pride was the reason, omitting mention of his years of sexual contact with a child.\n\nIn a sermon at Gateway on June 10, 2017, in a message titled \"The Principle of Honesty,\" Morris described going through a \"restoration process\" about seven years into his marriage -- which would have been in 1987. Morris said God told him he needed to confess \"everything that I've ever done\" to two people: Griffing, the former Shady Grove senior pastor, and his wife, Debbie.\n\nHe said he told Debbie, \"I need to tell you who you really married.\"\n\nThe confession took several hours, Morris said in the 2017 sermon, but he did not mention specific sins from the pulpit.\n\n\"I'll never forget what she said,\" Morris said, setting up a line that drew laughter from the Gateway congregation. \"She said, 'Robert, I knew you were bad when I married you. I didn't know you were that bad.'\"\n\nWhen he told that story again on Aug. 28, 2022, in a sermon titled \"Passing the Purity Test,\" Morris presented his openness about his past failings as something congregants should emulate.\n\nIn that sermon, he recounted the Old Testament story of King David's son Amnon, who is said to have raped his half-sister Tamar when she was a teenager. After he raped her, the Scripture says, Amnon's love for Tamar turned to intense hatred, Morris said.\n\nMorris presented the passage as a cautionary tale for \"young ladies\" in his congregation -- a warning about what can happen when girls allow men to have sex with them before marriage.\n\n\"When love turns to lust and lust is fulfilled, then love can turn to hate, and here's why,\" Morris said. \"One of the reasons, young ladies, that he loves you is he respects you. The very thing that the world tells you to give him so you can keep him could be the very thing that causes you to lose him.\"\n\nBecause, he said, \"you can't love someone you don't respect.\"\n\nAs she has watched Morris grow in power, prominence and wealth over the years, Clemishire said, she has always believed none of it would have been possible had he not hidden the truth of what he did to her.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2007, Sharpe, Morris' lawyer, sent a follow-up letter to Drummond indicating a desire to keep her allegations out of court. He proposed settling the matter through \"Christian arbitration consistent with 1 Corinthians 6:1-8,\" referring to a Bible passage evangelicals often cite to argue it is immoral to sue other Christians.\n\nSharpe said he had one goal with the suggestion: \"I was at the time trying to reach a good resolution for everybody.\"\n\nBut Clemishire, who did not agree to the arbitration, believes the true goal had been to keep her quiet and protect Morris from the types of repercussions he has faced since she went public last month.\n\n\"I don't think there was any true repentance or sorrow for what happened,\" Clemishire said.\n\nOtherwise, she said, \"that would not have been the response.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Clemishire said Morris told her to come see him in his room before bed, and she was the type of girl who listened to instructions from trusted adults.\n\nBut 25 years later, when Clemishire hired an attorney and threatened to sue Morris, accusing him of repeatedly molesting her as a child, a lawyer representing Morris responded by blaming Clemishire for what happened to her, according to 2007 correspondence obtained by NBC News.\n\n\"It was your client,\" wrote lawyer J. Shelby Sharpe, referring to Clemishire at age 12, \"who initiated inappropriate behavior by coming into my client's bedroom and getting in bed with him, which my client should not have allowed to happen.\"\n\nFor more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News with Lester Holt\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nThe Feb. 6, 2007, letter was one in a series of exchanges that year between Sharpe and Gentner Drummond, a lawyer who represented Clemishire at the time. Clemishire said in an interview last week she had been seeking $50,000 in restitution from Morris to cover the cost of counseling. Morris, through his lawyer, instead offered to pay $25,000, but the talks fell apart, Clemishire said, because she was not willing to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nDrummond, who is now Oklahoma's attorney general, confirmed Clemishire's description of the 2007 negotiations and declined to comment further.\n\nReached by phone Monday, Sharpe said that he had no recollection of the $25,000 settlement offer or NDA demand and that he no longer represents Morris. He denied knowing at the time that Clemishire had been a child when Morris began engaging in sexual behavior with her. However, the initial correspondence Drummond sent to him stated clearly that Clemishire was \"twelve years old\" when the abuse began.\n\n\"I don't ever remember seeing that,\" Sharpe said after a reporter read the document to him. After a reporter offered to share a copy of the messages, Sharpe said he did not have time to read them and declined to share an email address.\n\n\"I can tell you that the letters that you've seen, they speak for themselves,\" said Sharpe, who has also served as a personal attorney to Paige Patterson, a Southern Baptist Convention leader accused of mishandling or concealing sexual assaults that date back to the late 1980s. \"I will not amplify beyond those letters, because they speak for themselves.\"\n\nMorris did not respond to messages.\n\nClemishire went public with her accusations last month in a post published by the church watchdog site The Wartburg Watch. Morris responded with a statement admitting to \"inappropriate sexual behavior\" and saying he had long ago confessed and repented. Gateway Church leaders initially said Morris had been \"open and forthright about a moral failure he had over 35 years ago\" but later said they did not know Clemishire was a child at the time.\n\nWithin days, Morris resigned as senior pastor of the megachurch he started in 2000, and Gateway elders hired an outside law firm to investigate the matter.\n\nLawrence Swicegood, a Gateway spokesperson, said church leaders had not seen the 2007 letters between Drummond and Sharpe. Swicegood said that before Clemishire went public with her story last month, \"the current Elders did not have all the facts.\"\n\nWhile the internal review is underway, four Gateway officials have agreed to take leaves of absence from the board of elders, the church announced last month. One is pastor James Morris, Robert Morris' son. The three others served on the board of elders during the critical period from 2005 to 2007 when Clemishire was seeking damages.\n\n\"Gateway Church is committed to protecting people -- first and foremost children and the most vulnerable,\" Swicegood said in an email. \"Abuse simply cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nClemishire, now 54, sees the 2007 letter from Sharpe as part of a pattern of Morris and his associates' attempting to make her feel guilt and shame for what he did to her.\n\n\"They don't look at a child as someone to protect,\" Clemishire said.\n\nClemishire said she struggled for years with \"profound confusion\" over what Morris did, believing for nearly two decades that she was to blame. She said Morris molested her more than 100 times over 4\u00bd years. After the first encounter on Christmas in 1982, Clemishire said, \"it just progressed to a lot of kissing and touching and inserting fingers into my body.\" She said Morris pressured her to have intercourse, but she refused. Morris has acknowledged \"kissing and petting\" and argued that the number of incidents was a fraction of what Clemishire alleges.\n\nClemishire said that in the mid-2000s, after years of counseling and after having watched a television interview about grooming and sex abuse, she realized what happened to her was a crime.\n\nShe began writing to Morris at his Gateway Church email address in 2005, asking that he compensate her for the trauma she says he inflicted. In 2007, she hired Drummond to make a formal demand, according to documents provided to NBC News by Boz Tchividjian, the lawyer she hired last month.\n\nOn Jan. 30, 2007, Drummond wrote to Sharpe on behalf of Clemishire, using her legal name at the time, Cindy Clemishire McCaleb. Drummond detailed the sexual abuse Clemishire says she suffered from 1982 to 1987 and how Morris \"led her to believe that they were having a special relationship that had to remain secret.\"\n\n\"Morris convinced Ms. McCaleb that she was responsible for what he did to her,\" Drummond wrote, \"and he convinced her that she was the offender.\"\n\nDrummond attached a draft of a lawsuit he said Clemishire planned to file if Morris failed to respond within 15 days.\n\nSharpe responded a week later, on Feb. 6, 2007, with his letter casting Clemishire as the one who initiated sexual contact with Morris.\n\nSharpe also claimed in the letter that Clemishire \"acted inappropriately with two other men who stayed in her home between 1982 and 1987,\" when she was between the ages of 12 and 17. And Sharpe wrote that Clemishire had \"confessed her conduct\" to Glenda Faulkner, a woman who attended Shady Grove Church near Fort Worth, Texas, in the 1980s, when Morris was a pastor there.\n\nFaulkner, now Glenda Faulkner-Woodliff -- a licensed counselor who later attended Gateway -- did not respond to messages requesting comment.\n\nIn an interview, Clemishire disputed Sharpe's characterizations. She said two other men touched her inappropriately at her home when she was a child, but she said she did not initiate those interactions. In one instance, Clemishire said, it was Morris who instructed her, when she was 13, to go into a bedroom at her childhood home where another traveling evangelist was staying. Once she was inside, she said, the man, whom she declined to name, began to kiss her but eventually pulled away and told her she was too young.\n\nIn another instance, in 1986, Clemishire said, another man who was staying with her family climbed on top of her while she was sleeping on a sofa bed next to his 3-year-old daughter. She believed he planned to rape her, but she said the man suddenly got off of her.\n\n\"I really think God intervened,\" Clemishire said. \"God made him feel like someone was walking by, and he just rolled off of me and left.\"\n\nIt was that incident, Clemishire said, that eventually led her to confide in Faulkner-Woodliff, also a family friend. Faulkner-Woodliff asked whether anyone else had ever touched her that way, Clemishire said. Clemishire then reluctantly explained what Morris had done to her, she said. Afterward, Clemishire said, Faulkner-Woodliff insisted that she tell her parents.\n\nThat's how, in March 1987, her father learned that Morris had been sexually abusing her, Clemishire said. She said her father was enraged and contacted Olen Griffing, the senior pastor at Shady Grove Church, to demand that Morris step out of ministry.\n\nClemishire remembers getting a call from Morris' wife, Debbie, a few days later.\n\nDebbie told her, \"I forgive you,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll never forget that,\" Clemishire said. \"They wanted me to believe that I -- me, the child -- was responsible for what happened. And they've never stopped trying to make me believe that.\"\n\nGriffing, now in his 80s, later served as a pastor and elder under Morris at Gateway Church. He did not respond to messages.\n\nClemishire's older sister was living with her family in 1987 and corroborated Clemishire's account of conversations that took place that year among her sister, her parents, Faulkner-Woodliff, Griffing and the Morris family.\n\nIn the years since then, Morris has repeatedly told a sanitized and, at times, distorted version of the story. He has spoken often from the pulpit of struggling with sexual immorality and having to step out of ministry in 1987. But in public tellings, he says sinful pride was the reason, omitting mention of his years of sexual contact with a child.\n\nIn a sermon at Gateway on June 10, 2017, in a message titled \"The Principle of Honesty,\" Morris described going through a \"restoration process\" about seven years into his marriage -- which would have been in 1987. Morris said God told him he needed to confess \"everything that I've ever done\" to two people: Griffing, the former Shady Grove senior pastor, and his wife, Debbie.\n\nHe said he told Debbie, \"I need to tell you who you really married.\"\n\nThe confession took several hours, Morris said in the 2017 sermon, but he did not mention specific sins from the pulpit.\n\n\"I'll never forget what she said,\" Morris said, setting up a line that drew laughter from the Gateway congregation. \"She said, 'Robert, I knew you were bad when I married you. I didn't know you were that bad.'\"\n\nWhen he told that story again on Aug. 28, 2022, in a sermon titled \"Passing the Purity Test,\" Morris presented his openness about his past failings as something congregants should emulate.\n\nIn that sermon, he recounted the Old Testament story of King David's son Amnon, who is said to have raped his half-sister Tamar when she was a teenager. After he raped her, the Scripture says, Amnon's love for Tamar turned to intense hatred, Morris said.\n\nMorris presented the passage as a cautionary tale for \"young ladies\" in his congregation -- a warning about what can happen when girls allow men to have sex with them before marriage.\n\n\"When love turns to lust and lust is fulfilled, then love can turn to hate, and here's why,\" Morris said. \"One of the reasons, young ladies, that he loves you is he respects you. The very thing that the world tells you to give him so you can keep him could be the very thing that causes you to lose him.\"\n\nBecause, he said, \"you can't love someone you don't respect.\"\n\nAs she has watched Morris grow in power, prominence and wealth over the years, Clemishire said, she has always believed none of it would have been possible had he not hidden the truth of what he did to her.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2007, Sharpe, Morris' lawyer, sent a follow-up letter to Drummond indicating a desire to keep her allegations out of court. He proposed settling the matter through \"Christian arbitration consistent with 1 Corinthians 6:1-8,\" referring to a Bible passage evangelicals often cite to argue it is immoral to sue other Christians.\n\nSharpe said he had one goal with the suggestion: \"I was at the time trying to reach a good resolution for everybody.\"\n\nBut Clemishire, who did not agree to the arbitration, believes the true goal had been to keep her quiet and protect Morris from the types of repercussions he has faced since she went public last month.\n\n\"I don't think there was any true repentance or sorrow for what happened,\" Clemishire said.\n\nOtherwise, she said, \"that would not have been the response.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

She said her father was enraged and contacted Olen Griffing, the senior pastor at Shady Grove Church, to demand that Morris step out of ministry.\n\nClemishire remembers getting a call from Morris' wife, Debbie, a few days later.\n\nDebbie told her, \"I forgive you,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll never forget that,\" Clemishire said. \"They wanted me to believe that I -- me, the child -- was responsible for what happened. And they've never stopped trying to make me believe that.\"\n\nGriffing, now in his 80s, later served as a pastor and elder under Morris at Gateway Church. He did not respond to messages.\n\nClemishire's older sister was living with her family in 1987 and corroborated Clemishire's account of conversations that took place that year among her sister, her parents, Faulkner-Woodliff, Griffing and the Morris family.\n\nIn the years since then, Morris has repeatedly told a sanitized and, at times, distorted version of the story. He has spoken often from the pulpit of struggling with sexual immorality and having to step out of ministry in 1987. But in public tellings, he says sinful pride was the reason, omitting mention of his years of sexual contact with a child.\n\nIn a sermon at Gateway on June 10, 2017, in a message titled \"The Principle of Honesty,\" Morris described going through a \"restoration process\" about seven years into his marriage -- which would have been in 1987. Morris said God told him he needed to confess \"everything that I've ever done\" to two people: Griffing, the former Shady Grove senior pastor, and his wife, Debbie.\n\nHe said he told Debbie, \"I need to tell you who you really married.\"\n\nThe confession took several hours, Morris said in the 2017 sermon, but he did not mention specific sins from the pulpit.\n\n\"I'll never forget what she said,\" Morris said, setting up a line that drew laughter from the Gateway congregation. \"She said, 'Robert, I knew you were bad when I married you. I didn't know you were that bad.'\"\n\nWhen he told that story again on Aug. 28, 2022, in a sermon titled \"Passing the Purity Test,\" Morris presented his openness about his past failings as something congregants should emulate.\n\nIn that sermon, he recounted the Old Testament story of King David's son Amnon, who is said to have raped his half-sister Tamar when she was a teenager. After he raped her, the Scripture says, Amnon's love for Tamar turned to intense hatred, Morris said.\n\nMorris presented the passage as a cautionary tale for \"young ladies\" in his congregation -- a warning about what can happen when girls allow men to have sex with them before marriage.\n\n\"When love turns to lust and lust is fulfilled, then love can turn to hate, and here's why,\" Morris said. \"One of the reasons, young ladies, that he loves you is he respects you. The very thing that the world tells you to give him so you can keep him could be the very thing that causes you to lose him.\"\n\nBecause, he said, \"you can't love someone you don't respect.\"\n\nAs she has watched Morris grow in power, prominence and wealth over the years, Clemishire said, she has always believed none of it would have been possible had he not hidden the truth of what he did to her.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2007, Sharpe, Morris' lawyer, sent a follow-up letter to Drummond indicating a desire to keep her allegations out of court. He proposed settling the matter through \"Christian arbitration consistent with 1 Corinthians 6:1-8,\" referring to a Bible passage evangelicals often cite to argue it is immoral to sue other Christians.\n\nSharpe said he had one goal with the suggestion: \"I was at the time trying to reach a good resolution for everybody.\"\n\nBut Clemishire, who did not agree to the arbitration, believes the true goal had been to keep her quiet and protect Morris from the types of repercussions he has faced since she went public last month.\n\n\"I don't think there was any true repentance or sorrow for what happened,\" Clemishire said.\n\nOtherwise, she said, \"that would not have been the response.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors":

Shelby Sharpe, responded with accusations that Clemishire, then a child, was the one who initiated the sexual behavior.\n\n\"It was your client who initiated inappropriate behavior by coming into my client's bedroom and getting in bed with him, which my client should not have allowed to happen,\" Sharpe wrote in a February 2007 letter.\n\nSharpe's response also attempted to discredit Clemishire, alleging she had acted inappropriately with other men and confessing her conduct to a church member. Clemishire has vehemently denied these claims, stating that she was a victim, not an initiator. Clemishire refused Morris' counteroffer of $25,000 because she was unwilling to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nSharpe told NBC News that he had no recollection of the settlement offer or NDA demand and that he no longer represents Morris. He also denied knowing at the time that Clemishire had been a child when Morris began engaging in sexual behavior with her. However, the initial correspondence Drummond sent to him clearly stated that Clemishire was 12 when the abuse began.\n\n\"I don't ever remember seeing that,\" Sharpe told NBC after a reporter read the document to him. \"I can tell you that the letters that you've seen, they speak for themselves.\"\n\nSharpe has also served as a personal attorney to Paige Patterson, a Southern Baptist Convention leader accused of mishandling or concealing sexual assault claims that date all the way back to the 1980s.\n\nThe fallout from Clemishire's recent accusations has been swift. Within days of her story re-emerging online last month, Morris resigned as senior pastor. Gateway Church's elders quickly distanced themselves from Morris, claiming they were aware Morris had an extramarital relationship, but were unaware Clemishire was a child during the abuse. Gateway has hired an outside law firm to further investigate the matter, and several church officials, including Morris' son James, have taken leaves of absence in the meantime.\n\n\"The elders of Gateway Church learned that Pastor Robert's moral failure from more than forty years ago involved a minor,\" the board of elders of Gateway Church and the overseers of Pastor Robert Morris Ministries said in a joint statement posted on the Robert Morris Ministries homepage Wednesday. \"We are heartbroken and grief-stricken for this woman who has carried this burden of abuse for decades. Pastor Robert's sin and his lack of transparency to the church's elders and leadership has disqualified him from continuing in his role as senior pastor at Gateway Church and as leader of Pastor Robert Morris Ministries. As a result, all future radio and television broadcast ministry from Pastor Robert Morris Ministries has been canceled.\"", "source": {"uri": "relevantmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RELEVANT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_brown@relevantmagazine.com", "name": "Emily Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentner_Drummond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gentner Drummond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Church_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Church (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Morris University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shelby, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shelby, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elder (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Patterson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paige Patterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Universal_Life_Church", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Universal Life Church", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://relevantmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/morris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719319", "eventUri": "eng-9719319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-02-", "textStart": 954, "textEnd": 967}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

The three others served on the board of elders during the critical period from 2005 to 2007 when Clemishire was seeking damages.\n\n\"Gateway Church is committed to protecting people -- first and foremost children and the most vulnerable,\" Swicegood said in an email. \"Abuse simply cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nClemishire, now 54, sees the 2007 letter from Sharpe as part of a pattern of Morris and his associates' attempting to make her feel guilt and shame for what he did to her.\n\n\"They don't look at a child as someone to protect,\" Clemishire said.\n\nClemishire said she struggled for years with \"profound confusion\" over what Morris did, believing for nearly two decades that she was to blame. She said Morris molested her more than 100 times over 4\u00bd years. After the first encounter on Christmas in 1982, Clemishire said, \"it just progressed to a lot of kissing and touching and inserting fingers into my body.\" She said Morris pressured her to have intercourse, but she refused. Morris has acknowledged \"kissing and petting\" and argued that the number of incidents was a fraction of what Clemishire alleges.\n\nClemishire said that in the mid-2000s, after years of counseling and after having watched a television interview about grooming and sex abuse, she realized what happened to her was a crime.\n\nShe began writing to Morris at his Gateway Church email address in 2005, asking that he compensate her for the trauma she says he inflicted. In 2007, she hired Drummond to make a formal demand, according to documents provided to NBC News by Boz Tchividjian, the lawyer she hired last month.\n\nOn Jan. 30, 2007, Drummond wrote to Sharpe on behalf of Clemishire, using her legal name at the time, Cindy Clemishire McCaleb. Drummond detailed the sexual abuse Clemishire says she suffered from 1982 to 1987 and how Morris \"led her to believe that they were having a special relationship that had to remain secret.\"\n\n\"Morris convinced Ms. McCaleb that she was responsible for what he did to her,\" Drummond wrote, \"and he convinced her that she was the offender.\"\n\nDrummond attached a draft of a lawsuit he said Clemishire planned to file if Morris failed to respond within 15 days.\n\nSharpe responded a week later, on Feb. 6, 2007, with his letter casting Clemishire as the one who initiated sexual contact with Morris.\n\nSharpe also claimed in the letter that Clemishire \"acted inappropriately with two other men who stayed in her home between 1982 and 1987,\" when she was between the ages of 12 and 17. And Sharpe wrote that Clemishire had \"confessed her conduct\" to Glenda Faulkner, a woman who attended Shady Grove Church near Fort Worth, Texas, in the 1980s, when Morris was a pastor there.\n\nFaulkner, now Glenda Faulkner-Woodliff -- a licensed counselor who later attended Gateway -- did not respond to messages requesting comment.\n\nIn an interview, Clemishire disputed Sharpe's characterizations. She said two other men touched her inappropriately at her home when she was a child, but she said she did not initiate those interactions. In one instance, Clemishire said, it was Morris who instructed her, when she was 13, to go into a bedroom at her childhood home where another traveling evangelist was staying. Once she was inside, she said, the man, whom she declined to name, began to kiss her but eventually pulled away and told her she was too young.\n\nIn another instance, in 1986, Clemishire said, another man who was staying with her family climbed on top of her while she was sleeping on a sofa bed next to his 3-year-old daughter. She believed he planned to rape her, but she said the man suddenly got off of her.\n\n\"I really think God intervened,\" Clemishire said. \"God made him feel like someone was walking by, and he just rolled off of me and left.\"\n\nIt was that incident, Clemishire said, that eventually led her to confide in Faulkner-Woodliff, also a family friend. Faulkner-Woodliff asked whether anyone else had ever touched her that way, Clemishire said. Clemishire then reluctantly explained what Morris had done to her, she said. Afterward, Clemishire said, Faulkner-Woodliff insisted that she tell her parents.\n\nThat's how, in March 1987, her father learned that Morris had been sexually abusing her, Clemishire said. She said her father was enraged and contacted Olen Griffing, the senior pastor at Shady Grove Church, to demand that Morris step out of ministry.\n\nClemishire remembers getting a call from Morris' wife, Debbie, a few days later.\n\nDebbie told her, \"I forgive you,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll never forget that,\" Clemishire said. \"They wanted me to believe that I -- me, the child -- was responsible for what happened. And they've never stopped trying to make me believe that.\"\n\nGriffing, now in his 80s, later served as a pastor and elder under Morris at Gateway Church. He did not respond to messages.\n\nClemishire's older sister was living with her family in 1987 and corroborated Clemishire's account of conversations that took place that year among her sister, her parents, Faulkner-Woodliff, Griffing and the Morris family.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bowdler_Sharpe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Bowdler Sharpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Church_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Church (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elder (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Morris University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evangelism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240708-robert-morris-cindy-clemishire-ew-444p-0ce4e8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719319", "eventUri": "eng-9719319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-01-30", "textStart": 2653, "textEnd": 2666}, {"amb": false, "date": "2007-02-06", "textStart": 3269, "textEnd": 3281}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

He also stated that she acted inappropriately with two other adult men in her home as a child.\n\nIn a 2007 correspondence cited by NBC News, Morris' then-attorney, J. Shelby Sharpe, who also served as personal attorney for former Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary President Paige Patterson, suggested to Clemishire's attorney that she was at fault for the abuse she suffered when she tried to sue the megachurch founder.\n\n\"It was your client, who initiated inappropriate behavior by coming into my client's bedroom and getting in bed with him, which my client should not have allowed to happen,\" Sharpe wrote in the Feb. 6, 2007, letter when Clemishire asked for $50,000 in restitution from Morris to pay for her counseling.\n\nGentner Drummond, Clemishire's attorney at the time who is now Oklahoma's attorney general, confirmed the correspondence with NBC News but didn't offer any additional comment.\n\nSharpe, who no longer represents Morris, told the news network that he did not recall the settlement offer and denied knowing that Clemishire was a child when the abuse started.\n\n\"I don't ever remember seeing that,\" Sharpe said when he was reminded of the letter.\n\n\"I can tell you that the letters that you've seen, they speak for themselves,\" said Sharpe. \"I will not amplify beyond those letters, because they speak for themselves.\"\n\nSharpe reportedly stated in the 2007 correspondence that Clemishire \"acted inappropriately with two other men who stayed in her home between 1982 and 1987,\" when she was between the ages of 12 and 17, according to NBC News.\n\nThe letter noted that Clemishire \"confessed her conduct\" to Glenda Faulkner, a woman who attended Shady Grove Church near Fort Worth, Texas, in the 1980s, when Morris was also a pastor there.\n\nClemishire told NBC News that two other men touched her inappropriately in her home as a child, but she did not initiate the incidents.\n\nShe recalled one occasion, alleging Morris told her when she was 13 to go into a bedroom at her childhood home where another traveling evangelist was staying.\n\nShe said the man, who she did not identify, began to kiss her once she was inside the room but stopped himself and told her she was too young.\n\nAnother incident occurred in 1986. She said another man staying with her family climbed on top of her while she was sleeping on a sofa bed next to his 3-year-old daughter.\n\nShe said she believed he was going to rape her but stopped suddenly.\n\n\"I really think God intervened,\" Clemishire told NBC News. \"God made him feel like someone was walking by, and he just rolled off of me and left.\"\n\nAfter the 1986 incident, Clemishire said she decided to confide in Faulkner-Woodliff, who insisted she tell her parents what was going on with Morris.\n\nHer father urged Olen Griffing, the then-senior pastor at Shady Grove Church, to have Morris step out of ministry.\n\nMorris resigned from Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas, the megachurch he founded in 2000, on June 18. His resignation came after Clemishire reported that he began sexually abusing her on Dec. 25, 1982, when she was just 12 years old. She says the abuse continued for four-and-a-half years before it came to light. But Morris was later allowed to return to ministry.\n\nWhen questioned about the allegations by The Christian Post, Morris initially confessed to being involved in \"inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady\" more than 35 years ago and said he repented and was restored to ministry.\n\nElders at Gateway Church, who have commissioned an independent investigation into Clemishire's allegations, initially defended Morris and stated that the pastor, who was a married and a traveling evangelist at the time of the alleged abuse, had already repented and biblically restored to ministry.\n\nGateway elders later revised their public statement on the allegations in an announcement of Morris' resignation on June 18, saying they were not aware Morris had sexually abused a child.\n\n\"Regretfully, prior to Friday, June 14, the elders did not have all the facts of the inappropriate relationship between Morris and the victim, including her age at the time and the length of the abuse. The elders' prior understanding was that Morris' extramarital relationship, which he had discussed many times throughout his ministry, was with 'a young lady' and not abuse of a 12-year-old child,\" the elders explained.\n\n\"Even though it occurred many years before Gateway was established, as leaders of the church, we regret that we did not have the information that we now have. We are heartbroken and appalled by what has come to light over the past few days, and we express our deep sympathy to the victim and her family.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Church_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Church (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentner_Drummond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gentner Drummond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Patterson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paige Patterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Baptist_Theological_Seminary", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Morris University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shelby County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shelby County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evangelism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elder (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Christian Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southlake,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southlake, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southlake, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/26/03/260387.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719319", "eventUri": "eng-9719319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-02-06", "textStart": 871, "textEnd": 883}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3207, "textEnd": 3214, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 4235, "textEnd": 4242}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

In 2007, she hired Drummond to make a formal demand, according to documents provided to NBC News by Boz Tchividjian, the lawyer she hired last month.\n\nOn Jan. 30, 2007, Drummond wrote to Sharpe on behalf of Clemishire, using her legal name at the time, Cindy Clemishire McCaleb. Drummond detailed the sexual abuse Clemishire says she suffered from 1982 to 1987 and how Morris \"led her to believe that they were having a special relationship that had to remain secret.\"\n\n\"Morris convinced Ms. McCaleb that she was responsible for what he did to her,\" Drummond wrote, \"and he convinced her that she was the offender.\"\n\nDrummond attached a draft of a lawsuit he said Clemishire planned to file if Morris failed to respond within 15 days.\n\nSharpe responded a week later, on Feb. 6, 2007, with his letter casting Clemishire as the one who initiated sexual contact with Morris.\n\nSharpe also claimed in the letter that Clemishire \"acted inappropriately with two other men who stayed in her home between 1982 and 1987,\" when she was between the ages of 12 and 17. And Sharpe wrote that Clemishire had \"confessed her conduct\" to Glenda Faulkner, a woman who attended Shady Grove Church near Fort Worth, Texas, in the 1980s, when Morris was a pastor there.\n\nFaulkner, now Glenda Faulkner-Woodliff -- a licensed counselor who later attended Gateway -- did not respond to messages requesting comment.\n\nIn an interview, Clemishire disputed Sharpe's characterizations. She said two other men touched her inappropriately at her home when she was a child, but she said she did not initiate those interactions. In one instance, Clemishire said, it was Morris who instructed her, when she was 13, to go into a bedroom at her childhood home where another traveling evangelist was staying. Once she was inside, she said, the man, whom she declined to name, began to kiss her but eventually pulled away and told her she was too young.\n\nIn another instance, in 1986, Clemishire said, another man who was staying with her family climbed on top of her while she was sleeping on a sofa bed next to his 3-year-old daughter. She believed he planned to rape her, but she said the man suddenly got off of her.\n\n\"I really think God intervened,\" Clemishire said. \"God made him feel like someone was walking by, and he just rolled off of me and left.\"\n\nIt was that incident, Clemishire said, that eventually led her to confide in Faulkner-Woodliff, also a family friend. Faulkner-Woodliff asked whether anyone else had ever touched her that way, Clemishire said. Clemishire then reluctantly explained what Morris had done to her, she said. Afterward, Clemishire said, Faulkner-Woodliff insisted that she tell her parents.\n\nThat's how, in March 1987, her father learned that Morris had been sexually abusing her, Clemishire said. She said her father was enraged and contacted Olen Griffing, the senior pastor at Shady Grove Church, to demand that Morris step out of ministry.\n\nClemishire remembers getting a call from Morris' wife, Debbie, a few days later.\n\nDebbie told her, \"I forgive you,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll never forget that,\" Clemishire said. \"They wanted me to believe that I -- me, the child -- was responsible for what happened.

As time went on, she became more vocal, but experienced some internal hesitations.\n\n\"Like most believers, you don't want to do anything that's going to tarnish the name of God,\" she said. \"You don't want to tarnish the church, you don't want to hurt other believers, you don't want to, you know, cause another person to not come to Jesus.\"\n\nClemishire's main goal was to prevent Morris from serving in church leadership, a place she felt he didn't belong. Whenever Morris spoke at a church with which she or her family had an association, she, her sister, or her parents reportedly confronted leadership to tell them their story.\n\n\"I just wanted someone in leadership somewhere [to] take him out of the pulpit, because we did not feel as a family that that's where he should be in leadership,\" she said. \"When you can't even fill out a document honestly about working in your own church nursery, should you really be in the pulpit?\"\n\nBut, according to Clemishire, \"not once has any leadership stood up and said, 'This isn't biblical. You should not be in leadership.'\" Despite purportedly being ignored, she recently decided to share her story more broadly with The Wartburg Watch blog, sparking a fallout that led Morris to resign from Gateway.\n\nClemishire said a retired pastor who had heard her story had encouraged her to speak out. She said she feels her decision to share was predicated, in part, on \"God's timing,\" as she wouldn't have been prepared earlier for the attention and scrutiny she has received due to the story going so viral.\n\nNot a 'Young Lady'\n\nAs CBN News previously reported, Morris, 62, who resigned from Gateway last month, offered an initial statement on the allegations against him in which he used the term \"young lady.\"\n\nIn that statement to The Christian Post, Morris described what he said was \"inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady\" in a home he stayed in during his 20s. \"It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong,\" he said.\n\nThe preacher went on to state that the behavior happened on \"several occasions\" over a number of years. Morris said the situation was \"brought to light\" in 1987. He said he confessed, repented, sought counseling, and returned to ministry two years later with the support of the victim's father.\n\n\"I submitted myself to the Elders of Shady Grove Church and the young lady's father,\" Morris said. \"They asked me to step out of ministry and receive counseling and freedom ministry, which I did. Since that time, I have walked in purity and accountability in this area.\"\n\nClemishire has repeatedly spoken out against the use of \"young lady\" to describe what unfolded. She reiterated these comments in her interview with CBN News.\n\n\"It was a crime,\" she said. \"I was a little girl. ... Of course, it makes me a little angry, but, at the same time, it's just the whole deception of all of it.\"\n\nShe alleges the abuse started when she was 12 and concluded when she was 16 years old.\n\n\"He told me the very first time, 'You can't tell anyone because it will ruin everything,'\" she said. \"And as a 12-year-old, I had no idea what that meant. And as I ... got older, I still didn't really know what it meant, because, when I told, I felt like it ruined everything in my life. It ruined everything in my family's life.\"\n\nHolding on to Faith\n\nDespite facing hardship, Clemishire said she never lost hope -- or faith in the Lord. She credited her strong Christian upbringing with helping carry her through the tough times.\n\n\"My dad taught us about having a personal relationship with Jesus,\" she said. \"And, even though I have not been actively involved in any one particular church, I have attended church regularly at different times throughout my life.\"\n\nClemishire continued, \"But I have never stopped praying. I've never stopped reading my Bible. I mean, it truly has been about my relationship with Jesus. ... I don't know how anybody could get through any of this without that.\"\n\nMoving forward, Clemishire hopes to help support other victims and advocate to change the statute of limitations across the nation so that there's no expiration when it comes to victims being able to obtain legal justice after facing abuse.\n\n\"I want to be active in any way I can with changing the laws to protect the victims and not the predators,\" she said.\n\nIt's important to note that Morris's statement did not mention the name or age of whom he admitted to inappropriate sexual behavior. While he has remained silent since leaving Gateway, the church hired a law firm to conduct a thorough and independent inquiry to discover the truth.\n\nThe Elders' Response\n\nThe Board of Elders at Gateway has consistently updated the church community after Morris' resignation and asked for prayer for all parties, including Clamishire.\n\n\"Please be praying for those affected, including Cindy Clemishire, her family, the Morris family, Gateway members, staff, and others,\" a June 21 statement read. \"Pray that God will heal the brokenhearted, as He promises to do in Psalm 147:3. Be comforted by God's promise that He will never leave us nor forsake us. Keep loving God and His people. Remember that God brings beauty from ashes. He loves Gateway Church and He will get us through. He is the God of redemption and restoration.\"\n\nThere was confusion over the church's initial response, though. At first, when the news broke, elders defended Morris, but once more details emerged, they issued a second statement stating they did not previously know the scope or details of the allegations against the preacher. Here is that statement:\n\n\"The elders' prior understanding was that Morris's extramarital relationship, which he had discussed many times throughout his ministry, was with 'a young lady' and not [the] abuse of a 12-year-old child. We are heartbroken and appalled by what has come to light over the past few days, and we express our deep sympathy to the victim and her family. For the sake of the victim, we are thankful this situation has been exposed. We know many have been affected by this, we understand that you are hurting, and we are very sorry. It is our prayer that, in time, healing for all those affected can occur.\"\n\nSince the announcement that law firm Haynes & Boone, LLP will lead the independent investigation, the elders noted that any elder with a \"potential conflict of interest\" had been urged to take a \"temporary leave of absence from the Board of Elders.\"\n\n\"A leave of absence in no way whatsoever assumes or implies that any Elder had any knowledge of the true facts related to this situation,\" a June 28 statement read. \"Three of our current Elders are impacted by the law firm's recommendation.\"\n\nThese elders have said they had no knowledge of the allegations Clemishire has shared. Additionally, Pastor James Morris, Robert Morris' son, has taken a temporary leave from the Board of Elders so that a \"truly independent and unbiased inquiry\" can unfold.

To make matters worse, rather than describe the incident as child molestation, as it clearly was, he referred to it as \"inappropriate sexual behavior.\"\n\nOne thing that should not come as any kind of surprise to anyone is that he also had friends who were terrible human beings -- including his lawyer, one J. Shelby Sharpe.\n\nAs if describing child sexual abuse as \"inappropriate sexual behavior,\" were not horrific enough, Sharpe somehow managed to make it worse by claiming that it was the 12-year-old girl who started it.\n\nVia NBC:\n\n25 years later, when Clemishire hired an attorney and threatened to sue Morris, accusing him of repeatedly molesting her as a child, a lawyer representing Morris responded by blaming Clemishire for what happened to her, according to 2007 correspondence obtained by NBC News.\n\n\"It was your client,\" wrote lawyer J. Shelby Sharpe, referring to Clemishire at age 12, \"who initiated inappropriate behavior by coming into my client's bedroom and getting in bed with him, which my client should not have allowed to happen.\"\n\nI think we can all assume that, if that did happen, it's highly unlikely that the child did so looking for some action.\n\nAs if that were not repulsive enough, Sharpe also had the gall to bring up two other times Clemishire was assaulted by adult men at the ages of 12 and 13 as though that were evidence of some sort of moral failing on her part.\n\nShe also \"acted inappropriately with two other men who stayed in her home between 1982 and 1987,\" Sharpe wrote in his letter.\n\nIn an interview, Clemishire disputed Sharpe's characterizations. She said two other men touched her inappropriately at her home when she was a child, but she said she did not initiate those interactions. In one instance, Clemishire said, it was Morris who instructed her, when she was 13, to go into a bedroom at her childhood home where another traveling evangelist was staying. Once she was inside, she said, the man, whom she declined to name, began to kiss her but eventually pulled away and told her she was too young.\n\nIn another instance, in 1986, Clemishire said, another man who was staying with her family climbed on top of her while she was sleeping on a sofa bed next to his 3-year-old daughter. She believed he planned to rape her, but she said the man suddenly got off of her.\n\nAgain, that is not a 12-year-old being \"inappropriate,\" that is a 12-year-old being sexually assaulted by adult men.\n\nWhen asked about the letter by a reporter, Sharpe denied knowing that the girl was 12 at the time, though the lawyer representing Clemishire explicitly told him that she was 12 in their correspondence.\n\nIn addition to defending Morris, Sharpe has also defended Southern Baptist Convention leader Paige Patterson, who was accused of not doing anything to prevent the sexual abuse of children. So he's got some interesting priorities there.\n\nSpeaking of which, here he is talking about how \"no-fault divorce\" is somehow the cause of school shootings.\n\nDonate Just Once!\n\nOf course, even those who \"get it\" (\"it\" being that it is bad to molest children) still have a long way to go. The NBC article I cite here specifies that \"Cindy Clemishire was a 12-year-old girl who dressed in flowery pink pajamas and still liked to play with Barbie dolls\" -- and, you know, I'd really like to take a moment to point out how completely fucking unnecessary every word in that sentence after \"Cindy Clemishire was a 12-year-old girl\" is. There is no such thing as a 12-year-old who is or ever could be remotely complicit in their own sexual abuse by an adult. It doesn't matter what they were wearing or what their preferred after-school activities are. Why? Because they're 12. They are children, regardless of anything else they may do.\n\nThat is the same mindset that allows people like Morris, like Sharpe, to justify child sexual abuse by claiming the child was somehow more mature than they actually were -- like they did to Cindy Clemishire.", "source": {"uri": "wonkette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wonkette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robyn_pennacchia@wonkette.com", "name": "Robyn Pennacchia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Morris University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shelby, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shelby, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evangelism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Patterson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paige Patterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-fault_divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "No-fault divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fwonkette.substack.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fpost_preview%2F146457409%2Ftwitter.jpg%3Fversion%3D4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719319", "eventUri": "eng-9719319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Clemishire said Morris told her to come see him in his room before bed, and she was the type of girl who listened to instructions from trusted adults.\n\nBut 25 years later, when Clemishire hired an attorney and threatened to sue Morris, accusing him of repeatedly molesting her as a child, a lawyer representing Morris responded by blaming Clemishire for what happened to her, according to 2007 correspondence obtained by NBC News.\n\n\"It was your client,\" wrote lawyer J. Shelby Sharpe, referring to Clemishire at age 12, \"who initiated inappropriate behavior by coming into my client's bedroom and getting in bed with him, which my client should not have allowed to happen.\"\n\nFor more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News with Lester Holt\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nRead more: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna160661", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert Morris University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Hylton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antonia Hylton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southlake,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southlake, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southlake, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelby, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shelby, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719319", "eventUri": "eng-9719319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The child's mother filed the lawsuit in Tarrant County in 2020, which also claims pastors encouraged members of the congregation to ostracize her.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges conspiracy, in that church leaders knew about the alleged abuse and spoke with the alleged abuser, but did not inform law enforcement as well as attempting to discredit the allegations.\n\nAccording to the church, it is not guilty of any cover-up or failure to report, stating that the incident from the 2020 lawsuit did not happen on a Gateway campus or at a Gateway event, but between two teens during a sleepover at a family home.\n\nThe church says another teen was told about the incident and later relayed it to his mother, a Gateway Church staff member, who reported it to \"proper authorities within 48 hours.\"\n\nThe mother of the victim was irate and claimed [Gateway Church] intentionally hid the story for weeks and failed to report it to authorities,\" the church said in a statement to CBS News Texas. \"She decided to file a lawsuit against [Gateway Church] ... After the mother of the girl went through [six] different attorneys the insurance company decided to provide a settlement to avoid further litigation and expense. This was the 'compromise of disputed claims,' which Gateway justly defended in court.\"\n\nAs the accusations that the church's founder Robert Morris allegedly sexually abused a child decades ago received national attention, Gateway Church settled an unrelated case brought by an employee who claimed she was discriminated against and sexually harassed by her boss who allegedly told her \"God gave her cancer to teach her a lesson.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the plaintiff began working at the church in 2018 as an administrative assistant having recently finished treatment for cancer.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges derogatory remarks were made about her appearance by the pastor she worked for as well as unwanted \"romantic advances.\"\n\nShe reported this behavior in 2019, was told not to be alone with said pastor and was encouraged to apply for a more senior position.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that during the interview process, the plaintiff was told she was more than qualified; however, the church wanted to hire a man because \"our congregation responds better to men.\" She did not get the job and a man was hired for the role, according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe said she was forced to continue working with the pastor, including one-on-one, as he continued to make inappropriate remarks and tried to physically touch her. The lawsuit also claims when she requested to report to a different pastor she was accused of being insubordinate.\n\nIn 2021, the lawsuit states that at a lunch, the pastor asked the plaintiff if she knew \"what opened Pandora's box for the MeToo movement and if she knew what started that movement. After saying she did not, the pastor responded, \"It all started with the false accusations against Bill Cosby. Then that opened Pandora's box for all the false allegations.\"\n\nThat pastor was terminated later in 2021 with two years salary severance pay, and, according to the lawsuit, the plaintiff was told it was her fault, and offered six months severance payment if she would resign that day. A few months later, the plaintiff was fired during a Zoom call.\n\nBoth cases were settled for undisclosed amounts.\n\nThe public controversy for the megachurch began in June when Cindy Clemishire publicly claimed Morris sexually assaulted her starting in 1982 when she was 12. Morris was a traveling Evangelist in his early 20s and had become close with her family.\n\nThose allegations were first published by The Wartburg Watch, a North Carolina-based church watchdog blog and then picked up by The Christian Post. Clemishire told The Wartburg Watch the alleged abuse continued until 1987.\n\nMorris acknowledged in a sermon in 2014 that he was \"sexually immoral\" when he was a teenager and admitted to \"inappropriate sexual behavior\" In a statement to the Christian Post.\n\n\"When I was in my early twenties, I was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady in a home where I was staying,\" he said. \"It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years.\"\n\nChurch elders said Morris disclosed to them he'd had an extramarital affair, not that he had allegedly abused a 12-year-old.\n\nOn June 18, Morris resigned from his position as senior pastor at Gateway Church.\n\nClemishire said she has mixed thoughts and feelings regarding Morris' resignation and believes she is not the only victim.\n\n\"Though I am grateful that he is no longer a pastor at Gateway, I am disappointed that the Board of Elders allowed him to resign,\" Clemishire wrote in a statement. \"He should have been terminated.\"\n\nShe rebuked church elders for knowing and acknowledging her claims of sexual abuse, but intentionally embracing \"the false narrative Robert Morris wanted them to believe.\"\n\nProtesters gathered outside the church as a church elder addressed the congregation for the first time after Clemishire's statements.\n\n\"As an elder, I did not know the truth and, frankly, like many of you my wife and I are shocked, devastated and grieving,\" said Tra Willbanks, a Gateway Church elder. \"I'd like to express my personal compassion for Cindy Clemishire, I can't imagine carrying a burden like that for so many years and I want to say to you, Cindy, I'm so sorry.\"\n\nFour members of the Gateway Church Board of Elders, including Robert Morris' son, are now on temporary leaves of absence as an outside legal team investigates the sexual abuse of a child accusations against Morris.\n\nFounded in 2000, the Southlake-based Gateway Church expanded to become one of the largest congregations in the nation, drawing approximately 100,000 attendees each weekend to its nine campuses. Morris broadcasted his weekly program live online to over 190 countries, reaching even wider audiences.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [],

When it comes to sexual temptation don't fight, run,\" said Adeboye, who is the global general overseer of churches in his ministry, including in Africa, Europe and North America, in a recent sermon shared on YouTube.\n\n\"Remember, a couple of years ago when they accused one man of God of rape? I told my children, I said, I don't believe he committed rape. ... He did something, no doubt about that, but that he did it by force? [No.],\" he argued.\n\nAdeboye then explained how he warned his own children, especially the boys, to be vigilant when it comes to sexual temptation.\n\n\"I warned my children, particularly the boys, I said, if the devil comes against you, tell the devil to get lost. When you see a girl smiling at you in one coy-coy way, run, because you can't win the battle. ... Some of you say, daddy what are you saying? Are you saying you are running from [sex]? I say [run] fast. Without your anointing? Does your anointing turn your body to stone?\" he asked before point to the story of Samson.\n\n\"Samson was anointed. Singlehandedly he killed 1,000 soldiers. A woman finished him,\" Adeboye declared.\n\n\"I hope the boys are listening. You see that woman smiling at you everywhere you go? She's there smiling and she's not your wife. Run!\" the megachurch leader said.\n\n\"And for you girls, when you see this boy who comes and begins to say, when I look at you, where have you been all my life? It looks as if the sun has just come out. He's calling you sunshine. By the time he [is] finish[ed] with you, you won't even know the difference between sunshine and sunset. You may laugh, mark my word,\" he insisted.\n\nAdeboye noted that even at the age of 82, he knows he still cannot be too careful when it comes to sexual temptation.\n\n\"Somebody said, 'Are you saying that even at your age you are still running?' Faster than before,\" he said.\n\n\"Why? Because the closer you get to the finishing point the more careful you must be. Write that down. I'm not joking. Can anybody still be interested [in] an 82-year-old man?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's not interested in you for you,\" he said, explaining how the devil works. \"He's interested in you so that he can put an end to all the great work God had done through you.\"\n\nAnd with that comment, he alluded to the allegations against Morris without naming him.\n\n\"Didn't you read the paper that a man committed an offense or something around 42 or so years ago and now his ministry is finished,\" he said.\n\n\"Anybody tells you that whatever you've done is hid, it's hid until the wind begins to blow,\" Adeboye explained. \"Don't say daddy didn't tell you. I've told you, [the] Bible say [s] flee youthful lust. Flee. He didn't ask you to stay and say grace will be sufficient. There's no grace for what God says you should run from. Maybe grace to run.\"\n\nLast month, Cindy Clemishire, 54, reported that Morris began sexually abusing her on Christmas Day in 1982, when she was just 12 years old. She says the abuse continued for four-and-a-half years before he was found out. But he was later allowed to return to ministry.\n\nWhen questioned about the allegations by The Christian Post, Morris only confessed to being involved in \"inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady\" more than 35 years ago, and said he repented and was restored to ministry.\n\nClemishire insisted to CP, however, that she was no young lady when Morris abused her.\n\n\"I was 12 years old. I was a little girl. A very innocent little girl. And he was brought into our home. He and his wife, Debbie, and their little boy, Josh, trusted and preached at the church that my dad helped start and then began grooming all of us to do this, which took me decades to wrap my brain around as an adult,\" she said.\n\n\"It went on for many years. He says there was no sexual intercourse, but he did touch every part of my body and inserted his fingers into me, which I understand now is considered a form of rape by instrumentation. I was an innocent 12-year-old little girl who knew nothing about sexual behavior.\"\n\nGateway Church is now conducting an independent review of the allegations years after Clemishire said she had first contacted Morris via his Gateway email seeking restitution.\n\n\"The leadership at Gateway received actual notice of this crime in 2005 when I sent an email directly to Robert Morris' Gateway email address. Former Gateway elder, Tom Lane, received and responded to my email, acknowledging that the sexual abuse began on December 25, 1982, when I was 12 years old,\" Clemishire said in a statement previously released by her attorney Boz Tchividjian.\n\n\"Again in 2007, my then attorney Gentner Drummond (the current Attorney General of Oklahoma) sent a letter to Robert Morris with the hope that he would help reimburse me for the thousands of dollars I had expended in counseling as a result of this abuse. His attorney acknowledged the dates as well and then attempted to blame me for the abuse,\" she claimed. \"At the very least, both the Gateway pastor and at least one elder had specific notice that I was sexually abused beginning when I was 12 years old. Gateway had the information but intentionally decided to embrace the false narrative Robert Morris wanted to believe.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anointing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anointing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Devil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_Adeboye", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enoch Adeboye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Church_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Church (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Morris University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Epistle_to_Timothy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second Epistle to Timothy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sermon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redeemed_Christian_Church_of_God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redeemed Christian Church of God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentner_Drummond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gentner Drummond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Oklahoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of Oklahoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Christian Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/26/03/260354.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719319", "eventUri": "eng-9719319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Summer Series\" in the wake of child sex abuse allegations against founder Robert Morris.\n\nMeyer, who has talked publicly about the childhood sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of her father, has been a regular speaker at Gateway Church over multiple years. She most recently spoke at the megachurch in May. She was scheduled to speak there again for the summer series on July 20-21, but a person close to Joyce Meyer Ministries, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Christian Post late Monday that the televangelist has decided to stop teaching at Gateway Church in light of the allegations against Morris.\n\n\"I can confirm that Joyce Meyer has decided to withdraw from teaching at Gateway Church. The ministry has not made any public statements about this matter. But there are many examples readily available of Joyce Meyer strongly condemning all types of abuse and her compassion for survivors,\" the spokesperson told CP.\n\nIn 2016, Meyer revealed that her father must have raped her at least 200 times while she was a minor until she became 18, and the devil convinced her it was her own fault.\n\n\"He didn't force me physically, but through lies, and manipulation, and fears, and threats, I was still forced,\" she recalled.\n\n\"Literally, what he did was rape me, every week, at least once a week, until the time I was 18. My father, who I was supposed to be able to trust, who was supposed to keep me safe, raped me a minimum of 200 times.\"\n\nThe 81-year-old televangelist said dealing with the internalized guilt from the abuse was the most difficult stage of her healing and she struggled with it for most of her life.\n\n\"Well, I had a record playing in my head for most of my life 'What's wrong with me?' And I think it's so amazing [that] the first thing Jesus wants to give us is something right,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement to CP on Monday, a spokesperson from Dr. Carson's conservative think-tank, American Cornerstone Institute, said the retired neurosurgeon was asked to cancel his July 6-7 engagement at the church.\n\n\"Given the circumstances, the church asked us to cancel our earlier commitment in order to allow for the healing process to take place. We are praying for their community during this difficult time,\" the ACI spokesperson told CP.\n\nCarson and Meyer were among several regular high profile speakers scheduled to speak during Gateway Church's summer series. Other speakers include the embattled megachurch Pastor Tony Evans.\n\nEvans leads Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship church in Dallas, Texas. He recently stepped away from his pastoral duties for a season of restoration due to sin that was undisclosed by his church on June 9. He was scheduled to speak at Gateway Church June 10-11 and there is no evidence that he fulfilled that engagement online. He is also scheduled to speak at Gateway Church July 13 -14. It remains unclear whether that engagement will continue as planned.\n\nGateway Church did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CP on Monday.\n\nThough he also previously featured prominently in former President Donald Trump's Evangelical Executive Advisory Board, shortly after he resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse allegations last month, a spokesperson for Trump's 2024 presidential campaign said he no longer had a role on the board.\n\nWhile Morris hosted Trump at Gateway Church in June 2020 when Trump referred to him and fellow Pastor Steve Dulin as \"great people with a great reputation,\" campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told The New York Times that he was not included this year.\n\n\"President Trump's broad appeal among faith communities across the country is a testament to his unwavering commitment to upholding faith and the protection of religious liberties,\" Cheung said.\n\nMorris resigned from the megachurch on June 18, after Cindy Clemishire, 54, reported that he began sexually abusing her on Dec. 25, 1982, when she was just 12 years old. She says the abuse continued for four-and-a-half years before he was found out. But he was later allowed to return to ministry.\n\nWhen questioned about the allegations by CP, Morris initially confessed to being involved in \"inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady\" more than 35 years ago, and said he repented and was restored to ministry.\n\nClemishire insisted to CP, however, that she was no young lady when Morris abused her.\n\n\"I was 12 years old.

He says there was no sexual intercourse, but he did touch every part of my body and inserted his fingers into me, which I understand now is considered a form of rape by instrumentation. I was an innocent 12-year-old little girl who knew nothing about sexual behavior.\"\n\nGateway Church initially defended Morris when the abuse allegations were first made and stated that Morris, who was a married and a traveling evangelist at the time of the alleged abuse, had repented.\n\nGateway elders would later revise their public statement on the allegations in an announcement of Morris' resignation on June 18, saying they were not aware Morris had sexually abused a child.\n\n\"Regretfully, prior to Friday, June 14, the elders did not have all the facts of the inappropriate relationship between Morris and the victim, including her age at the time and the length of the abuse. The elders' prior understanding was that Morris' extramarital relationship, which he had discussed many times throughout his ministry, was with 'a young lady' and not abuse of a 12-year-old child,\" the elders explained.\n\n\"Even though it occurred many years before Gateway was established, as leaders of the church, we regret that we did not have the information that we now have. We are heartbroken and appalled by what has come to light over the past few days, and we express our deep sympathy to the victim and her family,\" the elders added.\n\nThe elders further stated that they retained the law firm of Haynes & Boone, LLP to \"conduct an independent, thorough, and professional review of the report of past abuse to ensure we have a complete understanding of the events from 1982-1987.\"\n\nClemishire has disputed the claim by Gateway Church that the elders had no knowledge that she was a child.\n\n\"The leadership at Gateway received actual notice of this crime in 2005 when I sent an email directly to Robert Morris' Gateway email address.

Robert Morris Scandal: Allegations, Reactions & Solutions EPISODE 240\n\nRobert Morris, founder of Gateway Church in Texas has been accused of past abuse of a girl who was twelve at the time. We react to a video from CBN News where the accuser, Cindy Clemishire, now 54, describes her experiences then and now as this story continues to build and develop. Four members of the Gateway Church Board of Elders, including Robert Morris's son are taking temporary leaves of absence as an outside legal team investigates the sexual abuse of a child accusations against Pastor Robert Morris. Gateway Church is a non-denominational, evangelical Christian multi-site megachurch based in Southlake, Texas, near Fort Worth. As of 2023, it was ranked as the 9th largest in the United States, with an attendance of 25,805. In 2024, its founding pastor, Robert Morris, resigned after allegations of past sexual abuse of a minor. His son, James Morris, is the Associate Senior Pastor and was set to take over next year. Why does this type of abuse keep happening in the Church and what can be done to mitigate it?

Forecasters upgrade the summer hurricane forecast after seeing Beryl's early-season power. And a NASA crew imitates life on Mars -- from a 3D-printed structure on Earth.\n\nHere's what to know today.\n\nWhether President Joe Biden should drop out of the presidential race has dominated political conversations since his disastrous debate performance almost two weeks ago.\n\nJust yesterday, another House Democrat joined calls for the president to drop his re-election bid. A Colorado lawmaker became the first Senate Democrat to publicly warn that Biden can't beat Trump. And ABC's George Stephanopoulos said he regrets talking to a passerby in New York City and appearing to say of Biden, \"I don't think he can serve four more years.\"\n\nThis is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nBiden has made it abundantly clear he isn't going anywhere. He has blamed party \"elites\" in Washington for the calls to step aside. But in interviews, rank-and-file Democrats, party chairs, battleground leaders and elected officials said Biden got it wrong. All along, they said, they have felt deep concerns about the president but have felt powerless to speak out.\n\n\"I would be crucified by them if I spoke out of line,\" a Democratic state party chair said, referring to Biden's camp.\n\nA Democratic House member likened Biden to \"the grandpa who refuses to give up the car keys even though it's not safe for him to drive anymore.\" The person added: \"There's also a growing resignation that, if Joe Biden insists on remaining our nominee, we will have to make the best out of a bad situation going into the most consequential presidential election in American history.\"\n\nThe sentiment among some Democrats is that a lack of enthusiasm among voters for Biden will negatively affect down-ballot races. They also feel the president took too long to do damage control, and now talk about his age is dominating a race that should be about former President Donald Trump.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAlec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial will get underway today in New Mexico, where the actor is charged in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film \"Rust\" in 2021. A full 12-person jury, as well as four alternate jurors, were selected yesterday after dozens of prospective jurors were interviewed.\n\nBaldwin and his defense team scored a legal victory earlier this week when the judge in the case ruled that Baldwin's role as a co-producer on \"Rust\" is not relevant to the trial. Here's what that means for prosecutors.\n\nBaldwin, who has pleaded not guilty, could be sentenced up to 18 months in prison if he's found guilty.\n\nHurricane Beryl left a path of destruction across the Caribbean before making landfall this week in Texas. Forecasters warn it's likely just the start of a \"hyperactive season.\" Colorado State University, a prominent hurricane and tropical weather forecast center, upgraded its seasonal forecast yesterday, with experts now predicting a season with 12 hurricanes. Six of those hurricanes are expected to become Category 3 or stronger. Earlier this year, the center had predicted 10 named storms and five major hurricanes.\n\nThat Beryl formed so early this hurricane season was a surprise. A Colorado State meteorologist and hurricane forecaster explained why.\n\nCleanup and restoration began in Texas, where millions of energy customers were still without power -- and therefore, air conditioning -- as forecasters warned of \"dangerous heat\" across the state.\n\nOn Christmas night in 1982, Texas pastor Robert Morris began what he would describe as \"inappropriate sexual behavior\" with Cindy Clemishire while he was staying at her parents' home in Oklahoma. Morris was a 21-year-old husband and father; Clemishire was a 12-year-old girl who still liked to play with dolls. Clemishire said Morris told her to come to his room before bed, and she was the type of girl who listened to instructions from trusted adults.\n\nBut 25 years later, when Clemishire hired an attorney and threatened to sue Morris, accusing him of repeatedly molesting her as a child, a lawyer representing Morris responded by blaming Clemishire for what happened to her, according to a 2007 correspondence obtained by NBC News.\n\nClemishire, now 54, went public with her accusations last month. Morris responded by admitting to \"inappropriate sexual behavior\" and resigned within days as senior pastor of Gateway Church.\n\nSenior investigative reporter Mike Hixenbaugh spoke to Clemishire about the correspondence. Not only do they shed light on how Morris explained his actions -- they also suggest who else might have known about it.\n\nA NASA mission meant to test how living on Mars would affect a human crew ended last weekend, with four volunteers emerging from a 1,700-square-foot, 3D-printed structure after living there for more than a year. While the crew inhabited the Mars Dune Alpha, they carried out tasks that astronauts on an actual trip to Mars would have, like habitat maintenance, sample collection and robotic operations. The crew members were also thrown a few curveballs to see how they'd respond. All the while, NASA observed their health and performance to learn how to support a crew during long missions.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic women's basketball team will feel the pressure of winning an eighth straight gold medal this summer in Paris, but veteran Diani Taurasi hopes to be a vital, calm presence. \"She's seen everything in every game, has done everything in every game, every scenario,\" said Team USA Head Coach Cheryl Reeve.

Gateway Church, Denise Edwards and youth leader Logan Edwards were all named as defendants, along with Doug Vaughn and Gateway Church pastors: Kelly Jones, Rebecca Wilson, Samantha Golden, Mondo Davis and Sion Alford.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case were both members of Gateway and sought damages of more than $200,000 but not more than $5,000,000.\n\nIn settling the case on April 18, Gateway Church and its pastors, who were accused of gross negligence and breach of their fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs as members, admitted no liability and stated that they only settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount to \"buy peace.\"\n\n\"All parties having waived a jury, it was announced to the court that an agreement for settlement of all matters in controversy, approved and recommended by the parties and the Guardian Ad Litem, had been entered, subject to the approval of the Court; ...\"\n\n\"The parties entered into a confidential compromise settlement agreement and release in full settlement of all claims of plaintiff against defendants. It was further announced that said compromise settlement agreement and release was being made on disputed claims against defendants and that defendants denied any liability to the plaintiff,\" the final judgement on the matter said. \"Defendants agreed to enter into the compromise settlement agreement solely to buy peace, without admitting any liability.\"\n\nAccording to the allegations in the case, prior to the sexual assault, the minor and her mother frequently attended worship services and participated in various ministries and church sponsored functions. On or around March 14, 2018, the minor was sexually assaulted by an unnamed member at the member's personal residence.\n\nIn his capacity as a youth leader at Gateway Church, defendant Logan allegedly became aware of the sexual assault through conversations with the alleged perpetrator and other youth who attended Gateway.\n\nLogan went on to share the allegations with other pastors and defendants named in the lawsuit.\n\n\"Defendants Samantha, Sion, Kelly, Rebecca, and Mondo were all informed of the sexual assault accusations to which Plaintiff Doe subjected to as being the central leadership of Gateway. Although Defendants were made aware of the sexual assault accusations made by Plaintiff Doe, a minor, none filed a formal complaint with the necessary child protective agencies, law enforcement agencies, or even alerted ... Plaintiff Doe's mother, to the existence of the alleged assault,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nThe Gateway pastors and other defendants in the case allegedly engaged in many conversations with the accused member and their parents. As soon as the minor's mother eventually learned what happened to her daughter, she filed a report with the Haltom City Police Department.\n\nAfter the victim's mother did that, the Gateway pastors were accused of trying to discredit the plaintiffs.\n\n\"The defendants who were ordained pastors of Gateway, embarked on a concerted campaign to conceal, misconstrue, and discredit the assault accusations while the active criminal investigation was ongoing. Defendants encouraged other members of Gateway to ostracize (minor's mother) ... and had her removed from the various ministries of which she had served dutifully,\" the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe minor and her mother claimed they were forced to \"endure immense shame and embarrassment, and emotional distress\" by the defendants who used their influence to taint the police investigation.\n\n\"Due to the weeks of active concealment by defendants, significant evidence of the alleged criminal assault was allowed to waste and degrade, further hindering law enforcement's ability to accurately investigate the original assault,\" the lawsuit adds.\n\nJust last month, 54-year-old Cindy Clemishire reported that Gateway Church founder Robert Morris began sexually abusing her on Dec. 25, 1982, when she was just 12 years old. Morris was a young adult married traveling evangelist at the time. Clemishire says the abuse continued for four-and-a-half years before Morris was found out, but he was later allowed to return to ministry.\n\nClemishire contends that officials at Gateway Church were informed of her allegations against Morris years ago. However, Lawrence Swicegood reiterated in a statement to The Christian Post that the current board of elders did not know that the megachurch founder had been accused of child sex abuse.\n\n\"The Board of Elders called a special meeting and accepted the resignation of Pastor Robert Morris several weeks ago. Gateway Church is committed to protecting people -- first and foremost children and the most vulnerable. Abuse simply cannot be tolerated,\" he said.\n\n\"The Board of Elders has retained the law firm Haynes and Boone, LLP to conduct a thorough and independent inquiry so that the facts can be understood. Even though this abuse occurred many years before Gateway was established, the Elders are committed to finding the truth and holding people accountable,\" he added.\n\n\"Regrettably, prior to Friday, June 14, the current Elders did not have all the facts. The Board of Elders is deeply committed to walking in integrity and finding the truth. Having this inquiry done by an independent and unbiased outside law firm is best practice. This review has begun, and the Board of Elders pledges its full cooperation.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Church_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Church (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Logan County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Logan County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Jones_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Jones (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Morris University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Christian Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiduciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrant_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Church service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Last Judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elder (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haynes_and_Boone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haynes and Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/26/03/260329.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719319", "eventUri": "eng-9719319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-18", "textStart": 840, "textEnd": 848}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-14", "textStart": 2078, "textEnd": 2092}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 5504, "textEnd": 5511}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 350, "textEnd": 361}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

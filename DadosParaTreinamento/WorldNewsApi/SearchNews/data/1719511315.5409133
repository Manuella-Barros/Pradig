{"id": 223765414, "title": "A former Miss America is running for Congress as a pro-choice \u2013 and anti-Trump \u2013 Republican in North Dakota", "text": "There\u2019s an anecdote from North Dakota dating back about 15 years that perfectly sums up both the culture of the state \u2013 the third-least populous in the mainland US \u2013 and the trajectory of one of its most celebrated daughters. Future Miss America Cara Mund, now 30, was then a tenth grader performing in the capital\u2019s annual Band Night, when throngs of North Dakotans crowd Bismarck for a parade featuring regional high schoolers and community organizations. Mund marched one lap as a percussionist playing the snare drum with her school band; then she dashed to change into an evening gown and sash to march another as Miss North Dakota Outstanding Teen. A high-achieving only child with a big smile from a family with a generations-long North Dakota pedigree, Mund seemed blessed with a blueprint for small-state-girl-done-good \u2013 and within a few years, she\u2019d earned two Ivy League degrees and been crowned Miss America. Now she\u2019s running for Congress in an attempt to become the first woman to represent North Dakota in the House. \u201cI never wanted Miss America to be my peak in life,\u201d Mund told The Independent. \u201cI wanted it to be the springboard for whatever comes next.\u201d Lest her successful path belie a penchant for toeing the line, however, Mund is running as a pro-choice Republican who \u201cwill not bow\u201d to Donald Trump, she says \u2013 in a state that\u2019s more than three-quarters heavily conservative, according to the Pew Research Center. Mund\u2019s ever-present smile shines through in her voice, infused with the upbeat intonations of a seasoned pageant winner; there is a steady steeliness, however, to every word she utters. Mund excoriated the 45th president with an answer during the 2017 Miss America competition which ultimately won her the crown; during her reign the following year, the Brown University alum took the hierarchy of the pageant itself to task. Mund sent a letter to former Miss Americas accusing the organization of bullying and manipulation, further throwing into turmoil a culture already battling a reputation for outdatedness and sexism. \u201cI had a very difficult year as Miss America and eventually spoke out,\u201d says Mund. \u201cThat really made me realize the power of my voice \u2026 despite all of the turmoil, I walked out like a very confident woman in who I am and that I\u2019m not afraid to say something \u2013 and that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case during the year. \u201cThere are parts of me that wish I would have said something sooner \u2013 and now, the woman I am today, I probably would have.\u201d Her 2024 congressional campaign, she says, is a direct result of not seeing anyone reflecting the woman she is today \u2013 or her values \u2013 amongst the candidate pool. \u201cHad I not jumped in the race, I don\u2019t know which candidate of the House I would have voted for \u2013 because, to me, they\u2019re all the same,\u201d she says, adding that she believes lack of options accounts for low voter turnout in her state. \u201cWe need to re-energize and realize that we don\u2019t have to stick with the status quo. We can be innovative; we can have great debate \u2026 but when the name-calling comes, and when you have people in there that you know exactly how they\u2019re going to vote, just based on what they\u2019re told to do, you lose your voice. \u201cSo I\u2019m hoping that all of my voters are definitely those that maybe wouldn\u2019t have voted in the primary otherwise. Fed-up Republican women \u2013 they\u2019re my voters.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Mund has thrown her hat in the ring; she ran as an independent in 2022, entering the race after party primaries were over. Mund made the decision right after graduating from Harvard Law School, while studying for the bar, amidst the leak of the Dobbs decision forecasting the overturn of Roe v. Wade. \u201cI knew, after the leak \u2026 that there is a high possibility that this could become a reality \u2013 and in a state like North Dakota, I also knew that we had a trigger ban, and women would not have the rights to their reproductive health care,\u201d she says.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll have children here in North Dakota,\u201d she continued. \u201cKnowing that most of the individuals making these decisions are men. I just did not feel comfortable with it. And so when the Dobbs decision came down in 2022, the two candidates for the US House were both candidates that did not support women\u2019s reproductive health, and that even included the Democrat. \u201cAnd so I could either sit by and complain about it, or I could jump in the race and be that voice and that advocate. And I really did feel like I was not alone in my beliefs.\u201d She\u2019s likely not wrong, given aspects of North Dakota\u2019s voting record on abortion. Ten years ago, despite the state\u2019s heavily conservative leanings and well-financed campaign, the legislature struck down a proposal to enshrine in the constitution \u201cthe inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development.\u201d \u201cIt was quite a big defeat, which was huge, especially as a state that is primarily red,\u201d Mund says. \u201cIt was a big awakening of: Okay, we do value women\u2019s rights; we value privacy.\u201d Mund only announced her first congressional bid after taking the bar in August 2022 and was \u201creally running my campaign on my own;\u201d still, the Democratic candidate dropped out and Mund, despite losing, walked away with about 36 percent of the vote. She was bolstered by the results in such \u201ca short amount of\u201d time \u2013 but even more so by the feedback she got from voters. \u201cThere were so many people that had just reached out and said: \u2018Thank you. I feel like I finally have a voice.\u2019 Or the number of messages I got where they\u2019d give a donation, and it would just have a note in there that would say: \u2018For my daughter.\u2019 \u2018For my granddaughter.\u2019\u201d Those messages helped Mund make the decision to run again for the House, filing paperwork last month to enter the race as a Republican; she\u2019s one of five candidates battling to fill the seat of Rep. Kelly Armstrong, who is running for governor. Mund says the state GOP, which has endorsed veteran and former US State Department employee Alex Balazs, did not invite her to participate in the first debate; she complains there are \u201ca few columnists in the state that like to call me the celebrity candidate.\u201d She\u2019s undoubtedly well known across North Dakota as the first Miss America hailing from the state; the governor even declared \u201cMiss America Cara Mund Day\u201d in 2017 in celebration of her win, and the state museum has featured her. But that notoriety is \u201creally a double-edged sword,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does give you a name recognition, but at the same time, I am constantly having to battle the stereotype of what people expect,\u201d Mund says, noting that she held the title for \u201cone year of my life.\u201d \u201cI went to law school for three years,\u201d she notes, and has been a lawyer even longer. She hopes that, next, she can represent and fight for the North Dakota women and moderates who comprise what she believes to be a significant portion of the voting bloc. \u201cThey\u2019ll come up and they might whisper: \u2018Voting for you,\u201d she says. \u201cNorth Dakota, in general, is a bit more reserved \u2013 and I just think people don\u2019t necessarily want to be extremely vocal, and then those that are, I\u2019m so appreciative of it, because it just shows to those that are maybe silently supporting, that they are not alone.\u201d Thoughts of the future family she hopes for, she reiterates, continue to hugely influence her campaign platforms. \u201cI come from a family of women that I expect it to be difficult to get pregnant and to be able to have a child \u2013 and I am very concerned about having kids in the state of North Dakota,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it\u2019s something top of mind. And we have one of the strictest bans now in the country \u2026 as a lawyer, too, I mean, with our trigger ban, I personally do not want to be in a hospital bed having to read case law \u2026 it\u2019s just not a place for the government to be.\u201d \u201cIn North Dakota, the Republican Party recently had a resolution that was also on banning IVF \u2026 this really is women\u2019s reproductive health care, women\u2019s health care, actually, just broadly across the spectrum. And it\u2019s also control of women.\u201d There is something particularly fascinating about the lack of support for Trump from Mund \u2013 a pageant queen with an effortless image in the style of the female politicians staunchly behind him. She\u2019s poised and articulate with even the same long tresses beloved by GOP women; the 30-year-old lawyer, however, bristles at the mention of him. \u201cThe reality is, he could become the next president, and, as the representative of North Dakota, I\u2019ll have to work with him,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I will not worship him \u2026 the other candidates, no one will speak out against him.\u201d She noted that at the governor\u2019s debate, one candidate said Trump\u2019s name 18 times, and at the House candidate debate, another said his name 16 times. \u201cWhen these candidates are campaigning just on him, or what they\u2019re going to do, it\u2019s like: You\u2019re a representative of our whole state,\u201d Mund says. \u201cAnd there might be policies \u2013 even if a Democrat\u2019s president, if the president is a Republican president \u2013 there might be policies that don\u2019t work for North Dakota, or you\u2019re going to have to cross the aisle because the policy is really great for North Dakota.\u201d Mund is trying to hammer home those points to voters as she hits the campaign trail \u2013 popping up at meet-and-greets across North Dakota and even, years after her turn as a percussionist and pageant winner, joining marchers again this month in the annual Bismarck Eckroth Music Band Night parade. \u201cPeople are electing us because they want us to do a job, and it\u2019s crucial that we have someone in there who\u2019s actually going to be an independent thinker \u2026 who\u2019s going to think critically about what\u2019s the best thing I can do for my state and the people who put me here,\u201d she tells The Independent. \u201cBecause they can put you there as quickly as they can take you out.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Miss America 2018 Cara Mund created shockwaves during her reign after publicly taking pageant leadership to task for bullying and other bad behavior.

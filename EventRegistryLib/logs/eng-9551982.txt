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

A SIMILAR SIGHT IN CHARLOTTE AS YESTERDAY'S SEVERE STORMS CAUSED THIS TOPPLED TREES. THOSE STORMS BRINGING HEAVY RAIN AND HAIL IN GREENVILLE SOUTH CAROLINA AS WELL. SOME OF THAT VIDEO WAS SENT TO US THROUGH U-LOCAL ON FACEBOOK. A REMINDER IF YOU HAVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO OF THIS STORM DAMAGE, YOU CAN SEND THEM TO US THROUGH U-LOCAL. ALSO, NEWS TIPS AT WXII 12.COM FOR EMAIL AND FOR FACEBOOK AGAIN U-LOCAL NORTH CAROLINA. JUST SEARCH THAT ANYTHING YOU POST THERE WILL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO SHARE HERE ON AIR. WE'RE SEEING HAIL EARLIER THIS WEEK BRIAN DYLAN JOINING US NOW. AND NOW WE'RE JUST SEEING A LOT OF HEAVY RAIN. HEAVY RAIN. YEAH. AND I'M JUST THANKFUL IT WASN'T MORE SEVERE HERE IN THE PIEDMONT TRIAD GUYS. YEAH. AND WE REALLY GOT THROUGH TWO WAVES RELATIVELY CLEANLY. WE WE DID HAVE THAT HAIL AS YOU MENTIONED. SOME NOISY STORMS LAST NIGHT WOKE A LOT OF FOLKS UP. UH, WE'RE CONTINUING TO WATCH SOME LEFTOVER SHOWERS COME THROUGH. BUT WE TALKED ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT WAVES COMING THROUGH. WE'VE HAD TWO SO FAR AND HAVE AVOIDED THE WORST OF THIS. AND WHAT CAME THROUGH OVERNIGHT SHOULD HELP STABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE ENOUGH TO REALLY LIMIT WHAT OCCURS IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SO IT'S STILL A LOT OF MOVING PARTS. THE DAMAGE THAT WE SAW WAS WAS IN A REALLY LARGE SWATH THAT CAME OUT OF KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE AND PUSHED INTO THE WESTERN CAROLINAS, INTO THE UPSTATE PORTION OF SOUTH CAROLINA. CHARLOTTE AREA GOT HIT WITH THAT STORM THAT DID PUT A WARNING SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING ON MONTGOMERY COUNTY YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, BOONE, BUT DID PRODUCE SOME VERY LARGE HAIL IN THE BARNARDSVILLE AREA. BASEBALL SIZED HAIL FROM THAT SAME STORM. A LOT OF LIGHTNING AND A LOT OF WIND DAMAGE. NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SENDING A SURVEY TEAM OUT THERE TO CHECK THAT OUT. WE'VE HAD A FEW GUSTS THAT WAS ABOUT IT. PEAK GUSTS AT PTI AIRPORT, 44MPH BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. RAINFALL TOTALS ARE STILL ADDING UP ANYWHERE FROM A FEW TENTHS TO ABOUT JUST OVER HALF AN INCH. AT THE AIRPORT, SMITH, REYNOLDS AND PTI, RESPECTIVELY. STILL SOME LINGERING RAIN THERE IT IS, ENDING IN GUILFORD COUNTY. SHOWERS BEGINNING TO PULL AWAY, BUT A STEADY LIGHT RAIN, MOSTLY OVER RANDOLPH EASTERN HALF OF RANDOLPH COUNTY DOWN INTO MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND IT'S JUST KIND OF SPOTTY OVER SOUTHERN WILKES, DOWN TOWARD MORAVIAN FALLS AND INTO MANY OF OUR MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS. THERE'S STILL A SECOND WAVE, AND EVEN THOUGH THE THE EASTERN FLANK OF THIS HAS REALLY STARTED TO SHOW SIGNS OF WEAKENING, THE LIGHTNING HAS DROPPED OFF QUITE A BIT THERE. THE HEAVY LIGHTNING PART IS LIKELY GOING TO MISS US TO THE SOUTH AND WEST, BUT THIS WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS IN AS THOSE STORMS CONTINUE TO COLLAPSE AND KEEP OUR RAIN CHANCES, ESPECIALLY IN OUR WESTERN COUNTIES, PRETTY DECENT THROUGH THE MORNING TEMPERATURE WISE. LOW TO MID 60S OVER MUCH OF THE AREA WITH SOME 50S RAIN COOLED AIR FARTHER WEST. YOUR HOUR BY HOUR FORECAST SHOWS YOU RAIN CHANCES INITIALLY DIMINISHING, BUT STARTING TO COME BACK, ESPECIALLY AS THAT SECONDARY WAVE COMES THROUGH. THIS IS A WETTER SCENARIO THAN WE'VE BEEN PAINTING SO FAR. THIS MORNING, BUT IT DOES KEEP A CHANCE FOR SOME LINGERING, MOSTLY LIGHT SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDER WEST IN OUR FORECAST THROUGH ABOUT LUNCHTIME TODAY, WE'LL GET A BREAK AND YOU CAN SEE THE COVERAGE OF AFTERNOON STORMS REALLY FALLS OFF PRETTY QUICKLY. THE RISK FOR SEVERE FROM ANY STORMS IS DECENT. THEY'RE TWO MOSTLY FOR SOME DAMAGING WINDS FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE DAY, AND A LESSER RISK ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS LATER ON TODAY. THIS SHOULD BE THE LAST OF THE WAVES COMING IN. WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING FOR THE WEEKEND IS LOOKING A WHOLE LOT BETTER, BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKING COMPLETELY DRY. DYLAN'S GOT MUCH MORE ON THAT PART OF THE FORECAST THAT INCLUDES MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND. YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, THE ALL IMPORTANT WEEKEND CELEBRATE MOM. RIGHT. SO OUR RAIN CHANCE HIGHEST TODAY. TOMORROW THERE COULD BE A COUPLE OF POP UP SHOWERS OR A THUNDERSTORM IN THE AFTERNOON, BUT WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT SEVERE WEATHER, SO GOOD NEWS THERE. SATURDAY AND SUNDAY LOOKING MAINLY DRY FOR ALL YOUR OUTDOOR PLANS TO HELP CELEBRATE MOTHER'S DAY. THERE'S THAT STORM RISK FOR TOMORROW. YOU SEE, THERE COULD BE A GENERAL POP UP THUNDERSTORM, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE ANYTHING SEVERE. SO GOOD NEWS THERE. HERE'S FUTURECAST STARTING OFF FRIDAY MORNING. DRY. YOU SEE THOSE STORMS POP UP MAINLY SOUTH AND EAST OF I 85. SO PLACES LIKE LEXINGTON, ASHEBORO, TROY, MAYBE OVER TO BURLINGTON. EVEN A BETTER CHANCE OF MAYBE A SCATTERED STORM TOMORROW AFTERNOON. BUT OVERALL COVERAGE SHOULD NOT BE VERY WIDESPREAD. WE HAVE THE CHANCE FOR MAYBE A PASSING SHOWER OR RUMBLE OF THUNDER, MAINLY IN THE WEST AND THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS ON SATURDAY. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS MOTHER'S DAY ON SUNDAY, ESPECIALLY LOOKING DRY. MAYBE YOU WANT TO GET OUTSIDE THE HOUSE ON FRIDAY. WE GOT THE HIGH POINT ROCKERS PLAYING FIRST PITCH AT 635 THERE AT TRUIST POINT. MAYBE A STRAY STORM IN THE AFTERNOON. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE MID AND UPPER 70S ON FRIDAY AND THEN COOLING OFF FOR THOSE LATER INNINGS. AND THEN ON SATURDAY WE'VE GOT MAYFEST HAPPENING IN DOWNTOWN PILOT MOUNTAIN. THIS GOES FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. NICE WEATHER FOR US, MAINLY OVER THE WEEKEND. SO SOME GOOD NEWS THERE. AND THEN OF COURSE I KNOW THE FORECAST. EVERYONE CARES ABOUT MOTHER'S DAY. NICE WEATHER TO CELEBRATE MOM 50S IN THE MORNING AND THEN MID 70S. DRY AND SUNNY IN THE AFTERNOON. SO THERE'S YOUR SEVEN DAY FORECAST. LOOKING TO STAY DRY ON MONDAY OF NEXT WEEK AS WELL.", "source": {"uri": "wxii12.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXII"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_slocum@wxii12.com", "name": "Brian Slocum",

DOESN'T MEAN A FEW STRONGER STORMS COULDN'T BE POSSIBLE IN TOWN, BUT I THINK THE BIGGER THREAT FOR LARGE HAIL, STRONG WIND GUSTS, AND EVEN SOME OF THE HEAVIER RAIN SHOWERS WILL BE WITH THOSE STRONGER STORMS TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE SEVERE THREAT THROUGH THIS EVENING. EASTERN OR EXCUSE ME, WESTERN KENTUCKY, NORTHERN TENNESSEE, BACK OVER INTO MISSOURI AND SOUTHERN ILLINOIS HAVE A LEVEL FOUR OUT OF FIVE ON THE SCALE OR A MODERATE RISK. AND THAT TAPERS OFF AS YOU HEAD TO THE NORTH AND EAST. SO AGAIN, WITH ALL OF THE STORM AND THE RAIN, CHANCES THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE INTO THE EVENING, JUST REMEMBER THAT THE WORST OF THE WEATHER GOES. IT'S THE OR THE THREAT GETS HIGHER THE FARTHER SOUTH AND WEST YOU GO ACROSS THE WLKY REGION FORECAST RADAR ALSO VERIFIES THAT AS SOME OF THOSE SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ROLL IN TOWARD THE METRO AS WE MOVE INTO THE EVENING, NOTICE AGAIN, THE WORST OF IT, THE BETTER CHANCES FOR THE STRONG TO SEVERE WEATHER SOUTH AND WEST. ONCE WE GET TOWARD THE MIDNIGHT HOUR, THOUGH, WE DO START WINDING DOWN ANY SEVERE WEATHER THREAT IN THE MAJORITY OF THE RAIN ACROSS THE AREA COULD BE A LINGERING SHOWER TO THE SOUTH. TOMORROW MORNING, BUT OVERALL, ONCE WE GET PAST THIS ROUND, THIS EVENING OF STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS, WE GET INTO SOME NICER AIR TOMORROW AFTERNOON. IT'S GOING TO BE BREEZY. WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOME SUNSHINE AND IT'S GOING TO START TO GET A LITTLE COOLER TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK. BUT IN YOUR 12 HOUR FORECAST THROUGH THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT NIGHT, WE'LL WATCH THOSE SHOWERS AND STORMS ON THE RADAR RIGHT NOW, TAPERING OFF TO JUST SOME PLAIN OLD RAIN AND THEN ENDING OVERNIGHT NIGHT FORECAST FOR TOMORROW HAS THE CONDITIONS NOT ONLY TRENDING DRIER, BUT MORE SUNSHINE MOVING OUR WAY. HIGHS STILL WARM, BUT THE HUMIDITY WILL START TO TAPER OFF INTO THE UPPER 70S. AND THEN IN YOUR SEVEN DAY FORECAST FRIDAY, HIGHS ONLY IN THE UPPER 60S. BUT THE MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND? LOOKING GOOD? YES, SPOTTY MORNING SHOWER, POSSIBLE SATURDAY, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE WEEKEND, INCLUDING SUNDAY, LOOKS DRY AND WARM. WE'LL WATCH FOR UNSETTLED WEATHER TO RETURN AS WE START TALKING PGA CHAMPIONSHIP WEEK. OH, WE'RE GOING TO SEE AT LEAST SOME UNSETTLED WEATHER, I THINK EVEN BEYOND THE SEVEN DAY, PERHAPS THE FIRST COUPLE OF ROUNDS. SO WE'LL BE MONITORING THAT CLOSELY.

YEAH, STEPHEN, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. SO OF COURSE, LAST NIGHT WAS IN CREDIBLY BUSY FOR US AND FOR YOU TOO. SO AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF TODAY, YOU'VE GOT SOME TIME IF YOU NEED TO GET ANY SORT OF CLEANUP GOING, YOU'VE GOT SOME TIME THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE WE START TO SEE THUNDERSTORMS REDEVELOPING THROUGHOUT GREATER CINCINNATI TONIGHT, CLOSER TO ABOUT 5 OR 6. WE WILL BEGIN TO SEE MORE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING IN. SPC DOES HAVE GREATER CINCINNATI UNDER A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER. THE THREAT, THOUGH, IS GREATER FARTHER TO THE SOUTH AND WEST. SO US HERE IN GREATER CINCINNATI, WE'RE UNDER THAT SLIGHT RISK. THAT'S LEVEL TWO OUT OF FIVE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE ANY SORT OF SEVERE STORMS. WE STILL HAVE THAT POTENTIAL. HOWEVER, I WILL SAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY, IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE BIT LESS LIKELY THAT WE SEE THESE STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS MOVING THROUGH. THAT'S GOOD NEWS. BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE YOUR GUARD DOWN. GO AHEAD AND MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF WAYS TO RECEIVE THOSE ALERTS AND WARNINGS TO YOUR PHONE, OR JUST TO YOU IN GENERAL, SO THAT YOU CAN GET ANY SORT OF WEATHER ALERT THAT COMES ACROSS YOUR WAY HERE TONIGHT. NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS ARE GOING TO BE QUIET. WE WON'T REALLY SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF CLOUD COVER UNTIL WE GET TO THIS EVENING, WHEN WE START TO SEE SOME THUNDERSTORMS REDEVELOPING. THESE ARE GOING TO START TO POP CLOSER TO ABOUT 5 OR 6:00 THIS EVENING, AND THAT THREAT FOR RAIN AND STORMS WILL CONTINUE ALL THE WAY THROUGH POTENTIALLY AS LATE AS ABOUT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. AGAIN. SO ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STORMS MOVING THROUGH DURING THE NIGHT TIME. I STILL THINK AS WE GO INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS, WE COULD SEE A FEW MORE SHOWERS ROLLING THROUGH THE AREA INTO TOMORROW MORNING. IN FACT, HEAVY RAINFALL IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WILL BE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON HERE THROUGHOUT THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FOR ALL OF GREATER CINCINNATI FOR THAT POTENTIAL FOR SOME HEAVY RAINFALL. AND THIS IS COMING DOWN ON TOP OF WHAT'S ALREADY FALLEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WE HAVE SO FAR PICKED UP A LOT OF RAINFALL TOTALS. ONCE WE GET PAST TODAY, LIKELY GOING TO EXCEED THREE INCHES OF RAIN FOR MANY COMMUNITIES. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 3 TO 4IN OF RAIN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WITH THAT, FLOODING IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL FOR FOR TONIGHT. SO AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF TODAY, WE ARE GOING TO BE DRY THROUGH ABOUT 5 OR 6. THEN THOSE THUNDERSTORMS START TO POP AND THEY WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT THAT THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER IS GOING TO CONTINUE INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT POSSIBLE ALL THROUGH. AT LEAST THIS EVENING INTO THE EARLY HOURS OF TONIGHT, SOME OF THOSE STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS COULD BRING US THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME HAIL AND THEN STRONG WINDS. THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN HAZARDS, ASIDE FROM THE HEAVY RAINFALL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR TONIGHT. BUT SOME LOW END TORNADO THREAT IS THERE AS WELL. SO THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE TO KEEP IN MIND FOR TONIGHT. HERE'S THAT FLOOD WATCH THAT'S GOING TO BE IN EFFECT THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS INTO TOMORROW MORNING. EVERYBODY IN GREATER CINCINNATI UNDER THAT FLOOD WATCH. SO THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE IN A FLOOD PRONE AREA. AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU GOT A LOT OF RAINFALL LAST NIGHT. SO I'M TALKING A LOT TO THE METRO AND JUST ALONG THE OHIO RIVER, BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THOSE STORMS PRETTY MUCH PARKED THEMSELVES YESTERDAY NIGHT. AND THEN YESTERDAY MORNING, TOO, WE HAD ALL THAT HEAVY RAINFALL. NORTHERN KENTUCKY. SO EVERYBODY UNDER THE RISK OF SOME HIGH WATER ISSUES AS WE HEAD INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH THAT RAIN ARRIVING TODAY, IS A WEATHER IMPACT DAY FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S ARRIVING TONIGHT. WE'LL STILL SEE A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS TOMORROW. OVERALL, THOUGH, WE'LL START TO DRY OUT INTO THE WEEKEND A LITTLE BIT. SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS STILL A POSSIBILITY ON SATURDAY. IT'S A WEATHER IMPACT DAY BECAUSE IT'S MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND.

BUT I THINK FOR MOST OF US IT'S GOING TO BE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND SOME MORE OF THOSE ISOLATED DOWNPOURS. THE ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN WORKED OVER, SO WE SHOULD STABILIZE A LITTLE BIT. ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE COMING IN THROUGH A TIME WHEN WE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT WARMER. SO AGAIN, WE'LL CONTINUE TO TRACK IT AS WE GO THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON THOUGH A COUPLE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE EARLY AFTERNOON, BUT I THINK FOR MOST OF IT, WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND MOST OF THE DAY CLEARING OUT AS WE GO INTO TOMORROW. WE'RE BACK TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES FOR FRIDAY IS GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY. YOU MIGHT RUN INTO A STRAY SHOWER OR TWO, BUT I THINK FOR MOST OF US IT'S GOING TO BE THOSE NICE NORTH WINDS FUNNELING IN, KIND OF DRYING US OUT AND COOLING US DOWN. IN FACT, BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, SUNDAY, OF COURSE, MOTHER'S DAY, WE ARE LOOKING AT COOLER TEMPERATURES BOTH OVERNIGHT, OF COURSE, DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS AND DURING THE AFTERNOON AS WELL. SO ESSENTIALLY AFTER THE MORNING AND MAYBE EARLY AFTERNOON, WE ARE GOING TO SEE A VERY DIFFERENT WEATHER PATTERN TAKE OVER. AND THAT IS GOOD NEWS. WE'VE STILL GOT OUR IMPACT DAY, OUR LIVE SUPER DOPPLER FOUR IMPACT DAY FOR THE MORNING AND THEN AGAIN AFTERNOON CLEARING TEMPERATURES NEAR 80 DEGREES FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. BREEZY TO WINDY AT TIMES. TOMORROW, THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY IN THE MORNING. I THINK A LOT OF THOSE WINDS ARE GOING TO KICK UP AS WE GO TOWARD THE END OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING, BUT SATURDAY SUNDAY LOOK ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TO BE OUTDOORS.

WE'VE HAD SEVERAL SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS, ESPECIALLY IN AND AROUND TOCCOA, ALL THE WAY THROUGH ELBERTON, ANDERSON, GREENWOOD, PELZER PICKING UP ON LOTS OF RAINFALL AND LOTS OF LIGHTNING. THESE SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS ARE COMING TO US FROM TENNESSEE BY THE WAY, THIS IS THAT LAST LINE OF REALLY NASTY WEATHER BEHIND THAT. WE'RE STILL GOING TO SEE SOME MORE RAINFALL. WE'VE STILL GOT SOME PRETTY GUSTY WINDS EMBEDDED IN SOME OF THESE STORMS. WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY IMPRESSIVE WINDS, BY THE WAY, 50, 60, EVEN 70 MILE AN HOUR WINDS EMBEDDED IN SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS. SO HERE LET'S TIME IT OUT TEN 11:00 TODAY.

THAT LUNCH HOUR WILL BEGIN TO SEE THESE TAPER OFF BECOMING A LITTLE BIT MORE ISOLATED AS COOLER, DRIER, MORE STABLE AIR SLOWLY WORKS ITS WAY BACK INTO THE FORECAST. AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT TOMORROW, A FEW STRAY SHOWERS IN THE MORNING ARE POSSIBLE. A FEW STRAY SHOWERS AGAIN IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. ALSO SOME WINDS.

IT'S GOING TO BE COMFORTABLE TO BE OUTSIDE, LOW HUMIDITY, NORTH WINDS, SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES. RETURNING TO THE 70S JUST IN TIME FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, WHICH OF COURSE IS MOTHER'S DAY. SO HERE WE GO LIVE SUPER DOPPLER FOUR ALERT DAY A M STORMS, RIGHT? WE'VE SEEN THOSE ALL MORNING LONG. CLEARING SLOWLY BY THE AFTERNOON TOMORROW. FEW STRAY SHOWERS, BREEZY TO WINDY AT TIMES.

STRONGER WIND AND MORE MOISTURE CHIEF METEOROLOGIST JOE DIAZ SHOWS US WIND. WELL, HERE'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE THE CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE AREA RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE THE GUSTY WINDS WILL BE COMING DOWN OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO, BUT AS WE GET INTO THE WINDS, ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT ON INTO FRIDAY MORNING, WE'LL HAVE THOSE WINDS GUST OVER 50 MILES AN HOUR WITH SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INCREASING THEREAFTER, SIMPLY BECAUSE THOSE CANYON WINDS WILL BE KICKING IN MORE MOISTURE. SO BREEZY AND COOLER TODAY. THERE'S ANOTHER SURGE THAT WILL BE WORKING DOWN AS WE GET INTO TOMORROW NIGHT. BUT FOR TONIGHT, WITH THE DRY AIR IN PLACE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT FREEZE EXPECTED IN AND AROUND THE FARMINGTON AREA. SO PROTECT THE TENDER VEGETATION AND YOUR PETS. AND AS WE LOOK AT THE FORECAST WITH HIGH WIND WATCH IN THE ALBUQUERQUE AREA TOMORROW. AND THIS WOULD BE TOMORROW EVENING ON INTO FRIDAY MORNING WITH THOSE GUSTS UP TO 55 MILES AN HOUR OR SO. SO TOMORROW AFTERNOON NOT TOO BAD. AND THEN AS WE GET INTO YOUR EVENING, THE STRONGEST WINDS HAPPEN AFTER MIDNIGHT. HERE'S A LOOK AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING. YOU SEE WINDS GUST OVER 50 MILES AN HOUR EAST OF THE RIVER, LESS TO THE WEST OF THE RIVER. AND THEN AS WE GET INTO THE FIRST PART OF FRIDAY, STILL SOME GUSTY WINDS COMING DOWN FROM THE TIJERAS CANYON AREA. SO TOMORROW MORNING WILL BE BREEZY AT TIMES. SO SOME BRISK READINGS AND THEN THE WINDS DO INCREASE AS WE GET INTO THE EVENING HOURS. AND AS YOU SAW, ESPECIALLY IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. BUT AS WE LOOK AT YOUR STATEWIDE FORECAST FOR THURSDAY MORNING, IT WILL BE COLD. LOOK AT THESE 30S AND FOR A TIME THEY'LL DROP UP TO AROUND FREEZING. AND THE FARMINGTON AREA, AS WE SHOWED YOU, THERE WILL BE SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CLIPPING THE NORTH END OF THE STATE. THIS IS FOR THURSDAY. WE TALKED ABOUT THE INCREASING CANYON WINDS AND THEN WE'LL GET INTO BREEZY CONDITIONS WITH TEMPERATURES AGAIN BELOW AVERAGE THROUGHOUT MANY AREAS, AND A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO CLIP NORTHERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO, BUT A BIT MORE ORGANIZED, ESPECIALLY FOR THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS ON INTO NORTHEAST PARTS OF THE STATE. FOR SATURDAY, WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVER EASTERN PARTS OF THE STATE AND NOT MUCH TO THE SOUTHWEST, AND GETTING INTO MOTHER'S DAY, WE'LL SEE AGAIN DRY CONDITIONS ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF NEW MEXICO, WITH FEWER THUNDERSTORMS. NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE STATE. SO THE FOUR CORNERS REGION FORECAST THAT FREEZE WARNING AROUND THE FARMINGTON AREA. SO PROTECT THE PETS AND THE TENDER VEGETATION. AND THEN A COUPLE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO WORK AROUND AS WE GET ON INTO SATURDAY. SOUTHWEST. THIS IS A QUIET PERIOD ACROSS THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL BE QUITE MILD, A BREEZY AT TIMES OVER THE WEEKEND, BUT MOST OF THE ACTION TO THE NORTH AND TO THE EAST OF THE AREA. TOMORROW 70 OVER IN RUIDOSO, 85 IN HOBBS AND WE'LL SEE TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO AROUND 71 DEGREES WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY SATURDAY. NORTHERN NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF NEW MEXICO. WE'LL GET INTO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AS WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON. YOU CAN GET CLIPPED WITH A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. IT LOOKS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ORGANIZED AS YOU ARE SEEING FOR THE START OF THE WEEKEND. BUT LOOK AT THOSE COLD READINGS. DAYTIME HIGHS ONLY IN THE 50S. THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS AGAIN, WE COULD GET CLIPPED WITH A BRIEF SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM THURSDAY ON INTO FRIDAY, A BIT MORE SCATTERED ACROSS THE AREA FOR SATURDAY AND A LITTLE LESS SUNDAY. AND THE METRO AREA WILL START OFF CHILLY AND GIVE WAY TO BREEZY CONDITIONS IN THE AFTERNOON. STRONG CANYON WINDS KICKING IN THURSDAY NIGHT ON INTO FRIDAY MORNING, AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL GET INTO LESS WIND FOR SATURDAY WITH SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND AND MOTHER'S DAY BELOW AVERAGE TEMPERATURES, BUT LESS WIND ACROSS THE REGION. BEFORE WE GET ON THAT WARMING TREND FOR MONDAY. TUESDAY ON INTO WEDNESDAY.

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL START TO THIS DAY. ERIC. SUNRISE LESS THAN ONE HOUR AWAY, I BELIEVE AT 607 THIS MORNING. THIS IS AN IMPACT WEATHER DAY, BUT THE MORNING IS QUITE PLEASANT AND A GOOD CHUNK OF THIS DAY WILL BE WEATHER FRIENDLY. IT'S THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT FOR THOSE STRONG IMPACT EAST WINDS TO HIT AND THEY WILL LEAD TO AN UNSETTLED SKY FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. WITH STORM CHANCES NEXT WEEK IT SHOULD BE WARMER. WE'LL CALL TODAY MILD 60S AND 70S FOR NORTHERN NEW MEXICO. AND AS THAT COLD FRONT BACKS INTO THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS, THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN SCATTERED RAIN AND MOUNTAIN SNOW COVERAGE HERE LATE IN THE DAY, UP AROUND THE SANGRE DE CRISTOS AND FOR THE LAS VEGAS AND RATON AREA, ALBUQUERQUE. WE'RE DRY AND MILD AT 75 AND NO WIND GUSTS ON THE DAY. TEENS AND 20S PRETTY REASONABLE. AFTER 7:00 THIS EVENING, THOSE EAST WINDS START TO DEVELOP AND GET PUSHED BACK INTO THE ALBUQUERQUE METRO, AND STRONG WINDS WILL BLAST OVERNIGHT. GOING TO BE A NOISY NIGHT. RIGHT NOW IT'S A HIGH WIND WATCH FOR EAST WIND SUSTAINED 30 TO 40 PEAK WIND GUSTS TO 60 OR SO AS THAT FRONT CONTINUES TO BACK ON THROUGH, WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE SCATTERED RAIN AND MOUNTAIN SNOW SHOWERS IN NORTHERN NEW MEXICO. AND, YOU KNOW, JUST A WIND WASH NIGHT. STILL A WINDY MORNING. AND THEN TOMORROW AFTERNOON, I THINK THE WINDS WILL LIGHTEN UP AND WE'LL STILL HAVE A CHANCE AT SHOWERS, MAINLY FAVORING THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS AND THE NORTHEAST PART OF THE STATE. FRIDAY MORNING'S WIND GUSTS. YES, STRONG. BUT NOTE BY FRIDAY, MIDDAY AND DURING THE AFTERNOON, WE'RE LOOKING AT WIND GUSTS IN THE TEENS AND 20S. PRETTY REASONABLE. BUT I THINK FRIDAY EVENING AND FRIDAY NIGHT THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A RESURGENCE OF THOSE EASTERLY WINDS KICKING UP. SO WE'LL GET BLASTED BY EAST WINDS TWICE ON FRIDAY EARLY AND THEN LATE IN THE DAY. BUT I THINK THE MORNING ROUNDS GOING TO BE STRONGER SATURDAY. THE MOST UNSETTLED DAY GOING FORWARD WITH A CHANCE AT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE CENTRAL, NORTHERN AND EASTERN PART OF THE STATE. SATURDAY'S WIND GUSTS REALLY NOT TOO BAD EXCEPT NEAR STORMS SHOULD BE IN THE TEENS AND 20S. NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO YOUR FOUR CORNERS FORECAST. WE TOP OUT IN THE UPPER 60S TODAY. WARMER THAN YESTERDAY, AND WE DO HAVE LOW 70S TOMORROW AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THERE WILL BE SLIGHT CHANCES AT SHOWERS FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY AND THEN PROBABLY DRIER AND WARMER SKIES MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY. HERE'S SOUTHWEST NEW MEXICO HIGHS IN THE LOW 70S ON THE HIGH TERRAIN, LOW 80S OFF OF THE MOUNTAINS. DOES LOOK LIKE WE'LL BE ABOUT FIVE WARMER TOMORROW AND STAY IN THE MID 70S THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AND THEN TOP OUT CLOSER TO 80 IN SILVER CITY NEXT WEEK. WE GET MISSED BY THE WEEKEND. RAIN CHANCES HERE IN SOUTHWEST NEW MEXICO. WE ALSO GET MISSED BY THE STRONG, GUSTY WINDS THAT WILL BE HITTING OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. HERE'S SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO 70S AND 80S ON THE THERMOMETER TODAY, AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN THE TEMPERATURES DOWN AFTER A SUN FILLED SKY TODAY. GOT A SLIGHT CHANCE AT STORMS FRIDAY SATURDAY. AND LOOK AT THE HEAT REALLY EASING. THAT'S LIKE FREE AC INTO THE WEEKEND. AND THEN NEXT WEEK CLIMBING BACK TO THE 80S AND INTO THE LOWER 90S. HERE'S NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO. I WOULD EXPECT AN INCREASE IN SCATTERED SHOWER COVERAGE LATE IN THE DAY. IN THE EVENING, AND WE'LL PROBABLY CATCH SOME SOME SNOW THIS EVENING. AND TONIGHT UP ON THE SANGRE DE CRISTOS, 55, IN RATON, 60 IN LAS VEGAS. LOOK AT THE COOL TEMPERATURES FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. HIGHS MID 50S. WE ARE THAT 65 TO 70 DEGREE RANGE BY SUNDAY. AND MONDAY. LOOK AT THESE DAILY CHANCES THAT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HERE IN NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO SATURDAY PROBABLY THE MOST ACTIVE DAY NORTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO 50S FOR CHAMA AND RED RIVER. 60S TAOS, LOS ALAMOS, SANTA FE. LOW 70S FOR THE ESPANOLA VALLEY. PROBABLY DRY IN MOST SPOTS, BUT A LATE DAY SHOWER CAN'T BE RULED OUT. CHANCES THAT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN PLAY STARTING REALLY FRIDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S. HERE'S THE ALBUQUERQUE METRO, A MILD BIT BREEZY AFTERNOON IN THE MID 70S. THIS WILL BE A PRETTY NICE MORNING AND PRETTY NICE DAY. IT'S THIS EVENING FOR THE STRONG EAST WINDS THAT CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND THROUGH ABOUT THE 10:00 HOUR FRIDAY MORNING AND THEN FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 10% STORM CHANCE HEIAR 30% CHANCE SATURDAY, AND THEN BACK DOWN TO 10% FOR MOTHER'S DAY SUNDAY.

I'LL BE WATCHING THE TIDES THERE CLOSELY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MORNINGS AS THEY ARE RUNNING ABOVE NORMAL, ESPECIALLY NOW AS WE'RE GETTING MORE OF AN EASTERLY WIND. THE HIGH TIDE THERE IN ANNAPOLIS JUST BEFORE 7:00, AND THERE WILL BE SOME MINOR FLOODING AROUND THE CITY DOCK, MAINLY JUST AT THE PARKING LOT, BUT NOT REACHING THE BUILDING. SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THOSE BUSINESSES AT THE CITY DOCK. BUT ABOVE NORMAL TIDES ALONG THE SHORELINE OF ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF MORNINGS, HIGH TIDE IN ANNAPOLIS THIS MORNING IS NEAR 7:00. WE'LL HAVE SOME RAIN DEVELOPING TODAY. IT'S NOT HERE YET, BUT TIMES OF RAIN THROUGHOUT THE DAY, WITH A MUCH COOLER TREND TODAY. ONLY IN THE 60S, TOMORROW ONLY IN THE 50S, AND WE'LL WAIT FOR A WARM UP TO COME BY NEXT WEEK. BUT ALTHOUGH WE'RE KIND OF IN A GLOOMY AND COOL WEATHER PATTERN, SATURDAY COULD BE THE NEXT TIME WE ACTUALLY SEE JUST A HINT OF SUN. NOT ALL WEEKEND, BUT SOME HINTS OF IT COMING UP. FOR NOW, WE'RE SEEING INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND WE'RE DRY AT THE MOMENT, BUT SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ARE ALREADY SHOWING UP IN VIRGINIA AND WESTERN MARYLAND, SO WE'LL WATCH AS IT TAKES A FEW HOURS FOR THESE TO ARRIVE HERE. WE'RE BASICALLY GETTING INTO THE COOL SIDE NOW OF THE ATMOSPHERE, SO THAT'S DRIVING A LOT OF THESE STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS FARTHER SOUTH OF US. SO THAT'S THE CHANGE I'VE MADE TO THE FORECAST. MOSTLY RAIN IN OUR FORECAST TODAY RATHER THAN A THREAT OF ANY STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS. YOU'LL SEE THIS MORNING THAT WE'RE STILL MOSTLY DRY BEFORE 8:00. WORST CASE. OH GOSH, I FEEL SOMETHING OFF. AND I WAS LIKE, I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS LIKE JUST A LOOSE HAIR OR A BUG. YOU ALWAYS GOT TO CHECK. OKAY? OKAY. COMPOSE MYSELF. WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS COMING IN ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY, AND EVEN THIS AFTERNOON. A FEW COULD BE SHOWING UP, BUT NOTICE HOW SCATTERED THEY ARE SO THAT MEANS YOU MAY GET RAIN AT TIMES. OTHER TIMES IT COULD BE DRY, SO I WOULDN'T CANCEL THINGS OUTDOORS TODAY, BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE AN UMBRELLA WITH YOU. I KNOW MY KIDS GOING ON A FIELD TRIP TODAY AND I SAID, JUST BRING YOUR RAIN BOOTS. JUST IN CASE. WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME RAIN SHOWERS CONTINUING THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. THAT'S WHERE THEY COULD BE A LITTLE HEAVIER IN SOME POCKETS POSSIBLY. THAT IS WHEN WE'RE SEEING A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. LITTLE MORE ENERGY IS COMING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE BY THEN BECAUSE A COLD FRONT IS MOVING IN. SO WE'RE GOING TO DROP DOWN EVEN MORE BY TOMORROW. TODAY, THOUGH, THE RAIN SHOWERS ARE SPECIALLY STARTING AFTER 9:00 AND THEY'LL CONTINUE ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHERE WE'RE ONLY CLOSE TO 70 FOR THE AFTERNOON. HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE ONLY IN THE 50S TOMORROW, AND WE STILL HAVE SOME RAIN SHOWERS ON AND OFF DURING THE DAYTIME NOW. SATURDAY. THAT'S THE DAY I MENTIONED WE COULD SEE A PEAK OF SUN. IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AND THEN BY THE AFTERNOON WE WILL SEE A FEW RAIN SHOWERS DEVELOPING. SO SATURDAY NIGHT LOOKS A LITTLE MORE SOGGY. AND THEN I DO THINK THERE COULD BE SOME RAIN SHOWERS ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON SUNDAY FOR MOTHER'S DAY. SO AGAIN, AS YOU'RE MAKING PLANS THIS WEEKEND, SATURDAY DURING THE DAY MIGHT BE YOUR BETTER TIME FRAME TO BE OUTDOORS. LOOK AT MONDAY THAT'S REALLY SHINING THERE WITH MORE SUN, A WARMER DAY IN GENERAL, COMPLETELY DRY BECAUSE WE DO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY COMING IN NEXT WEEK.

NOW INCLUDES MOST OF THE UPSTATE AND WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH 4 A.M. AS THIS ACTIVITY BACK TOWARD THE WEST IS GOING TO TRY TO MAKE A RUN FOR OUR AREA. AND WE'RE WATCHING IT CLOSELY. GRIFFIN HARDY AND I ARE IN HERE WITH OUR EYES PEELED ON LIVE SUPER DOPPLER FOUR. WATCHING THIS WITH INSTANT ACCESS TO THAT DATA, WHICH IS ALSO CRUCIAL IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. SO OUR DOPPLER SITS HERE IN THE UPSTATE, STRETCHING INTO WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA WITH A GOOD VIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO TELL YOU, THIS RAIN IS COMING DOWN HARD AND HEAVY, JUST LIKE THAT NEWLY ISSUED SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING. THIS IS A LARGE BOX. YOU SEE THIS HAPPEN WHENEVER YOU HAVE A LINE LIKE THIS COME THROUGH. THEY JUST GO AND ISSUE FOR ALL THE COUNTIES, RIGHT? FRANKLIN UP THROUGH BRYSON CITY, JACKSON COUNTY, HAYWOOD COUNTY, BUNCOMBE COUNTY, MADISON COUNTY, ALL INCLUDED IN THIS BRAND NEW SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING FOR STRONG WINDS. LET'S GET IN HERE AND PUT A TRACK ON THIS ACTIVITY AS IT'S ROLLING THROUGH. AS WE LOOK AT THIS, MOVING ON THROUGH THE AREA RIGHT NOW, THIS NEW WARNING THAT IS IN PLACE FOR THESE COUNTIES IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA GOES UNTIL 1215. SO STRONG WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. LET'S PUT A FRESH TRACK ON THIS ACTIVITY RIGHT HERE AS IT MOVES EAST INTO HENDERSON AND BUNCOMBE COUNTIES. LET ME CLEAR THIS UP A LITTLE BIT. DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT. HERE WE GO AGAIN AS IT MOVES THROUGH THESE AREAS, PUSHING TOWARD THE EAST INTO WAYNE, ASHEVILLE, ASHEVILLE, MARION, HENDERSONVILLE, ALL BETWEEN NOW AND ABOUT 1230. BUT IT'S MOVING QUICKLY. I MEAN, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BOOKING IT RIGHT NOW. LIGHTNING HEAVY RAIN, CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE'LL ALL HERE TONIGHT. ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS THE KIDS MAY BE RUNNING INTO YOUR ROOM. PETS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE SCARED SIDE WITH THE THUNDER, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF ELECTRICITY OUT OF THIS. WIND IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. OUT OF THIS, YOU'LL LIKELY HEAR THE WIND WHIPPING AROUND THAT RAIN AND AT TIMES SOME THUNDER. THE LIGHTNING HERE ON THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT 5000 LIGHTNING STRIKES HERE ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE INTO NORTH CAROLINA. OKAY, SO THE SEVERE THREAT THROUGH TONIGHT IN THE LEVEL TWO MEDIUM CATEGORY, WE ALSO HAVE A MEDIUM RISK FOR AN ISOLATED SPIN UP TORNADO, SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING CLOSELY. THAT THREAT MUCH HIGHER JUST TO OUR WEST. AND THEN TOMORROW AS WE GO THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT THREAT IS SOUTH OF US AS. THE STORM SYSTEM KIND OF RAMPS UP AND ARRIVES IN THOSE AREAS AT THE PEAK HEATING OF THE DAY, STORM FUEL RIGHT NOW RELATIVELY HIGH. WE'VE BEEN MUGGY AND WARM ALL DAY, AND THAT'S CONTINUING. AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE TORNADO INGREDIENTS, THERE'S SOME OF THAT BUILDING BACK THROUGH GEORGIA AS WELL. WE'VE BEEN SEEING THAT ON THE HIGH SIDE. NOW. THE LATEST COMPUTER MODEL WANTS TO INCH SOME OF THIS INTO OUR AREA THROUGH MIDNIGHT, 1:02 A.M. AND THEN THE BULK OF THAT TRIES TO PUSH TOWARD THE SOUTH GOING INTO EARLY MORNING HOURS TOMORROW. NEW COMPUTER MODEL JUST FINISHED PROCESSING HERE SHOWS THIS ACTIVITY CROSSING INTO THE MOUNTAINS INTO THE UPSTATE BETWEEN NOW AND 1 A.M. SO THE NEXT TWO HOURS CROSSING INTO SOUTH CAROLINA AROUND 1 A.M. AND THEN MOVING THROUGH GREENVILLE ONE 132 AND THEN PUSHING TOWARD THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE UPSTATE. TWO, THREE THREE, 330 AND THEN PUSHING OUT OF THE AREA. AT LEAST THAT FIRST ROUND THROUGH ABOUT 5 A.M. WE'RE NOT DONE. WE'VE GOT ANOTHER ROUND OF RAIN, POSSIBLY A FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS IN THIS AS WELL THROUGH 9 A.M., AND THEN BETWEEN 9 AND 10. THE WORST OF THIS IS STARTING TO SCOOT ON OUT OF HERE, AND BETTER WEATHER MOVES IN. WE'RE IN THE MID 60S TO CLOSE TO 70 DEGREES RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE AREA FROM ABBEVILLE TO HARTWELL. THIS IS THOSE AREAS THAT ARE ISSUED UNDER THAT TORNADO WATCH AT THE MOMENT. TOMORROW MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP, THE SEVERE ASPECT SHOULD BE PUSHING TO THE EAST, BUT WE'RE SEEING STILL MUGGY CONDITIONS, RAIN AND SOME THUNDER AND LIGHTNING WILL EVENTUALLY TOP OUT AT A MUGGY 82. IN GREENVILLE, 81 IN ASHEVILLE. THE FOUR DAY LOOKS LIKE THIS. WE'VE GOT A LIVE SUPER DOPPLER FOUR IMPACT DAY TOMORROW WITH LINGERING RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS, ESPECIALLY EARLY ON. A LINGERING SHOWER CAN'T BE RULED OUT ON FRIDAY AT 80 DEGREES, BUT BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, WE'RE CLEARING OUT LOWER HUMIDITY, VERY WARM TEMPERATURES IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE UPPER 70S TO AROUND 80 DEGREES.

THAT'S IT. AND WE'RE ALMOST THERE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE IN THE LOW 50S ALREADY SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A LOT OF MOVEMENT TEMPERATURE WISE BECAUSE WE STAY OVERCAST ALL DAY. AND WE DO HAVE AGAIN, THOSE SHOWERS, MAYBE A ROGUE THUNDERSTORM. AGAIN THIS IS NOT SEVERE GOING INTO THIS EVENING. WE START TO DRY OUT. IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME FOR ALL OF US. BUT THE WINDS WILL DIE DOWN AND WE WILL CLEAR UP AS WE HEAD OVERNIGHT. TONIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE MAIN BULK OF THE ACTIVITY. IF YOU ARE, I WOULD SAY SOUTH OF WEST BEND. YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO SEE ANY SHOWERS TODAY. IF YOU DO. THEY'RE REALLY ISOLATED. MOST OF THIS IS GOING TO BE CENTERED BETWEEN BASICALLY MILWAUKEE AND CHICAGO. AS FAR AS OUR SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE CONCERNED, MUCH MORE ACTIVITY DOWN TOWARDS THE DEEP SOUTH TODAY, ALABAMA AND ALSO INTO GEORGIA. THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF SEVERE WEATHER TO THAT AREA. LOOKING AT THE RADAR, YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE HEAVIER SHOWERS NEAR FITCHBURG, MADISON. IN JANESVILLE, IT HAS BEEN GENERALLY WEST OF US. AS YOU CAN SEE, THOSE SHOWERS ARE FILLING IN AND THAT WILL BE AN INCREASING TREND AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY. WE DO ACTUALLY HAVE A FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE FOX RIVER NEAR NEW MUNSTER. YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT ON THE BORDER THERE OF KENOSHA AND RACINE COUNTY. THERE COULD BE SOME ROADS IMPACTED BY THAT. IT WILL. IT IS EXPECTED TO CREST TO A FLOOD STAGE AS WE GO TO SATURDAY. SO JUST A HEADS UP. ROADS ARE WET THIS MORNING AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THE D.O.T. I-43 AT HIGHLAND THERE TODAY, AN IMPACT DAY WITH THAT HIGH OF 56 DEGREES WITH THE RAIN. THE WIND COMING OFF THE LAKE UP TO 20 MILES AN HOUR, A MUCH COOLER DAY TOMORROW WE'RE BACK TO SUNSHINE. SATURDAY LOOKS REALLY GOOD. SUNDAY. A LOT OF THE DAY LOOKS DRY AS WELL. I DON'T THINK WE SEE RAIN CHANCES UNTIL WELL LATE IN THE DAY, SO THAT COULD BE OKAY FOR MOMS. AND NEXT WEEK WE ARE IN FOR YES, ANOTHER ACTIVE PATTERN. SO FUTURECAST REALLY PICKING UP THIS ACTIVITY. WELL REALLY TAKING ALL OF IT MAINLY SOUTH OF MILWAUKEE AND GETTING INTO CHICAGO. YOU SEE THOSE RAIN SHOWERS REALLY MOVING ON OUT. HERE'S 1:00. JUST A COUPLE OF SPORADIC SHOWERS. AND FOR THE MOST PART, BY THREE AND 4:00, ALL THAT ACTIVITY STARTS TO ROLL OUT. SO IF YOU NEED TO MOW THE LAWN, OBVIOUSLY TODAY IS NOT THE DAY. FRIDAY AND SATURDAY YOU HAVE SOME DRY CONDITIONS TO GET THAT DONE. GET IT DONE FOR MOM. SHE DOESN'T NEED TO BE MOWING THE LAWN THIS WEEK. IT'S HER WEEK. YOU DO AS YOU CAN SEE, WE DO HAVE THE AMOUNT OF RAIN I'M NOT EXPECTING THIS TO BE A BIG RAINMAKER. YOU MIGHT GET A QUARTER OF AN INCH OUT OF THIS SYSTEM, AND OVER THE WEEKEND, 67 IN MADISON ON SATURDAY, 73 GOING INTO YOUR SUNDAY FOR MILWAUKEE, I'M GOING 63 BECAUSE WE HAVE A BIT OF A LAKE BREEZE. SUNDAY WE GET THAT BUMP UP IN TEMPERATURE HERE. I DO THINK FOR MOTHER'S DAY SUNDAY DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD. YOU KNOW, BREAKFAST IN BED MAY BE NICE AND CLEAR, BUT WE'LL BE BREEZY AT TIMES THROUGH THE DAY. THERE WILL BE SOME INCREASING SHOWERS AS WE GO INTO THE EVENING HOURS. THE TIMING ON THIS IS STILL A LITTLE IFFY. I WILL KEEP YOU GUYS POSTED ON HOW THAT LOOKS AT THE MOMENT, BUT TODAY AS YOU HEAD OUT THE DOOR, GRAB THE UMBRELLA, GRAB THE COAT. I KNOW IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE YOU'VE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT THE COAT BECAUSE IT WAS SO NICE, BUT YEAH, THAT 56 PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO FEEL SO GOOD AFTER, UH, AFTER THE 75 YESTERDAY WE HAVE THE SUNSHINE FOR FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY DOES FEATURE SHOWERS LATE AND YOU KNOW, I ORIGINALLY HAD THE SEVEN DAY FORECAST THAT HAD CHANCE OF SHOWERS EVERY DAY. I'M JUST GOING TO PUT ANOTHER ACTIVE WEEK. YEAH. AT THIS POINT ACTIVE WEEK SOMETHING CHECK BACK EVERY DAY. HERE WE GO AGAIN. YEAH IT LITERALLY JUST LOOKS LIKE THAT I'M LIKE COME ON. OH WE CAN'T GET OUT OF THIS. NO.

THIS IS FIRST ALERT WEATHER HORTON WEEKEND COMING UP THIS WEEKEND. AND WE'RE APPRECIATING THE SUNSHINE. BUT WE HOPE IT'LL LAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. RIGHT. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE QUITE A BIT OF IT THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BUT WE ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON A FEW RAIN CHANCES HERE. SO IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR. IT'S A GOOD NAP TIME, GOOD NAP TIME WHEN YOU GET THAT RAIN. I THINK MONDAY IS GOING TO BE A GOOD LIKE NAP DAY. STAY INSIDE, READ A BOOK, CHILL OUT SORT OF DAY. I WILL SHOW YOU MORE ON THAT IN JUST A MOMENT. IF YOU HAVE PLANS, MAYBE TO HEAD OUT TO THE SPORTING GAME ON SATURDAY SATURDAY EVENING AGAINST HOUSTON, IT WILL BE A GREAT EVENING. 73 DEGREES FOR KICKOFF, 66 IN THE SECOND HALF. WE'RE DRY SATURDAY EVENING ON MOTHER'S DAY FOR THE KC CURRENT. THEIR GAME AGAINST NC. THERE MIGHT BE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS AROUND AS OF RIGHT NOW. THE CHANCES ARE LOW, BUT JUST WANT TO GET YOU THAT FIRST ALERT THAT HEADS UP THAT WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON THOSE STORM CHANCES. TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE 70S TO START UPPER 60S FOR THE SECOND HALF. RIGHT NOW WE JUST HAVE SOME CUMULUS CLOUDS. WE'RE AT 73 DEGREES. THAT WIND IS STILL GUSTING UP NEAR 25 MILES AN HOUR OUT OF THE NORTH NORTHWEST. WIND SPEEDS ARE GENERALLY 10 TO 15 MILES AN HOUR, WITH A FEW OF THOSE STRONGER GUSTS HERE AND THERE. OUR TEMPERATURES ARE SO COMFORTABLE, LOWER AND MIDDLE 70S WITH THOSE PUFFY CUMULUS CLOUDS. AND IF YOU LOOK REALLY CLOSELY, YOU MIGHT JUST SEE A LITTLE BIT OF GREEN ON THE MAP BETWEEN MARYVILLE AND TRENTON. SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ARE TRYING TO MOVE IN FROM THE NORTH. THOSE SHOWERS ARE RUNNING INTO DRIER AIR. SO IN GENERAL, WE'RE GOING TO BE DRY GOING THROUGH THE EVENINGS. WE'LL KEEP THAT RAIN CHANCE DOWN NEAR ZERO, ESPECIALLY FOR THE METRO AND AREAS SOUTHWARD. MIDDLE 60S BY EIGHT LOW 60S HEADING TOWARDS NINE AND TEN. YOUR LOWS BY OR FRIDAY MORNING. IT WILL BE A COOL START. UPPER 40S AND LOW 50S LIKE WE SAW THIS MORNING. FROM THERE IT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER NICE DAY TO MAYBE GET OUTSIDE, GET SOME YARD WORK IN, OR IF YOU HAVE TO DO ANY CLEANUP FROM THE ROUNDS OF STORMS THAT WE'VE HAD EARLIER IN THE WEEK. WE'LL BE AT 66 MIDDAY, LOW 70S, HEADING IN THE AFTERNOON, AND LOTS OF SUNSHINE AS FAR AS THOSE HIGHS. AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO TOP OUT LOWER 70S FOR TOMORROW. SO BEAUTIFUL DAY ON YOUR FRIDAY. PLENTY OF SUNSHINE THEN HEADING INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. HERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING. WE'VE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON THIS. IT IS POSSIBLE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEE THE NORTHERN LIGHTS HERE ON THE LOW NORTH HORIZON. AS WE'RE GETTING SOME ACTIVE SOLAR ACTIVITY. SO WHEN YOU START TO SEE MORE OF THAT, IT INCREASED THEIR CHANCES OF SEEING THE NORTHERN LIGHTS. SO WITH THAT DISCLAIMER POSSIBLE VIEWING FOR THE KANSAS CITY AREA IS MORE VISIBLE ON YOUR CAMERA. SO ON YOUR PHONE, IF YOU TRY AND TAKE A PICTURE, THEN HOW IT WOULD APPEAR WITH YOUR NAKED EYE AS FAR AS WHERE TO LOOK, LOOK NORTH, LOOK LOW. THAT'LL BE THE BEST CHANCE. OUR BEST LOCATION TO LOOK FOR THE NORTHERN LIGHTS. AND AGAIN, THIS IS TOMORROW NIGHT AND FIND THE LOCATION AWAY FROM CITY LIGHTS. THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM AGAIN. WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BEST TIMING TO SEE THOSE NORTHERN LIGHTS, BUT AGAIN, WE'RE FOCUSING IN ON TOMORROW NIGHT, SATURDAY. SUNNY, 76, MOTHER'S DAY. THAT CHANCE OF SEEING A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AND THEN ON MONDAY, THAT'S OUR NEXT IMPACT DAY. 60% CHANCE OF RAIN, A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN THE MIX. WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT SEVERE WEATHER WITH THIS NEXT SETUP. SO GOOD NEWS THERE.

SCRATCH THAT, THAT'S TODAY. NOW. JUST KIDDING. YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, LOOK, HERE'S HERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS. WE'RE TODAY IS THE PEAK TOMORROW. IT'S STILL GOING TO BE HOT. OKAY. BUT WE'RE GOING DOWN. AND THEN WE MAY HAVE SOME LATE DAY SHOWERS AND STORMS IN OUR NORTHERN COMMUNITIES. I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT GUYS HERE IN A SECOND. BUT THERE IT IS, 97 DAYTONA BEACH. HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR. SANFORD 97. ORLANDO 97. BOY OH BOY IS A BURNER OUT THERE FOR SURE. HOTTEST SO FAR. YEP. IN ORLANDO, IN SANFORD, IN LEESBURG AND DAYTONA BEACH, MELBOURNE YOU ONLY HAD 90 TODAY. SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WATCH THAT. NOW HERE'S THE INTERESTING AND INTRIGUING PIECE ABOUT TONIGHT'S FORECAST. YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE CLUSTER OF STORMS HERE. WE'VE GOT THIS BIG RIDGE HERE A LOT OF TIMES WHAT THE MODELS CANNOT PICK UP ON IS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE LITTLE MICRO SCALE FEATURES. AND IF THIS CAN PUT A DENT IN THE RIDGE, IT KIND OF LENDS THE PATH FOR THIS NEXT IMPULSE TO MAYBE GET A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO US. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING AGAIN, VERY, VERY CAREFULLY. I AM IN THE CAMP THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME SHOWERS AND STORMS TOMORROW, ESPECIALLY IN OUR NORTHERN COMMUNITIES, BUT BUT THE FARTHER SOUTH THIS CAN COME, I THINK IT CAN PUT MORE OF CENTRAL FLORIDA AT RISK FOR SOME STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS. LOOK AT ALL THE LIGHTNING STRIKES. NOW TO AMOUNT OF WIND WITH THIS PARTICULAR FEATURE. SO WE'LL KEEP TABS ON THAT. I'LL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THIS TONIGHT AT TEN AND 11. NO IMPACT TONIGHT. THIS IS SETTING THE STAGE UP FOR SOMETHING POTENTIALLY COMING ON IN ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THAT RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS TOMORROW. LOOK AT THE HEAT. IT IS 96, IN BITHLO. SANFORD IS 88, IN OCALA. AND 88 RIGHT NOW. BACK TOWARDS MELBOURNE AND TITUSVILLE AS THE BREEZE HAS WORKED ON, IT FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES, TRIPLE DIGITS IN MANY LOCALES. JUST SLOW DOWN, TAKE IT EASY FOR THE IOWA CORPORATE FIVE K. OF COURSE, THEY PUSH THE RACE BACK TO HOPE FOR SOME WHAT COOLER TEMPERATURES INSTEAD OF 9798? WE'RE. 9192 AT THE START OF THE RACE, GETTING DOWN TO ABOUT 90. LET'S TAKE A LOOK NOW. TOMORROW MORNING, 70 TO 75 DEGREES. DAY PLANNER 95 SHOULD ABOUT DO IT FOR AN AFTERNOON HIGH. I DON'T HAVE ANY STORMS IN THERE NOW, BUT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SETUP HERE. AGAIN, IF THIS CAN GET CLOSE TO PALM COAST TONIGHT, THEN I THINK WE COULD HAVE SOME ISSUES HERE DURING THE AFTERNOON TOMORROW WITH AGAIN, A COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF SOME SHOWERS AND STORMS POTENTIALLY COMING ON IN, WHICH IS GREAT NEWS AS WE DO NEED THE RAIN. WE JUST DON'T WANT THAT SEVERE WEATHER COMPONENT TO COME WITH IT, ESPECIALLY WITH TEMPERATURES OUT AHEAD OF IT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING CLOSE TO 95 DEGREES. THE MODELS ARE HINTING AT A COUPLE DISTINCT SWATHS OF HEAVY RAIN THAT INDICATIVE OF A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS COMING ON THROUGH. NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CHANCE FOR SOME SCATTERED SEVERE STORMS IN OUR NORTHERN COMMUNITIES. THIS MAY HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED FARTHER SOUTH, CLOSER TO THE METRO AREAS FOR ME, THOUGH, THE BIG IS GOING TO BE THE DAMAGING WINDS. THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST CONCERN TOMORROW. UP NORTH, CLOUDS AND SHOWERS GET IN. EARLIER 95 IN TOWN, 80 UP THAT WAY. AND THEN FOR MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND THE FRONT SCOOTS ON SOUTH OF US WERE CALMER. WE'RE DRIER AND WERE A LITTLE BIT COOLER. NOW. WE WON'T BE COOL. WE'LL BE COOLER.

THIS IS REALLY EARLY FOR US TO FEEL THIS HEAT. THIS IS SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, THAT WE FEEL IN THE SUMMER MONTHS. SO IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM FOR SOME FOLKS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE VISITING US FROM UP NORTH. BUT THIS IS NOT GOING TO LAST LONG. WE DO HAVE A FRONT THAT'S GOING TO BE MOVING IN TO HELP COOL US DOWN IN A SECOND, BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN. HERE'S A LOOK AT THE BEACH, THOUGH. AS SHELDON MENTIONED EARLIER, IT IS A BIT PACKED AT THIS LUNCHTIME HOUR. CAN'T BLAME THESE FOLKS ANYTHING TO COOL DOWN RIGHT NOW. NEW SMYRNA BEACH WE'RE AT 86 DEGREES 89, IN SANFORD, 89 RIGHT NOW IN ORLANDO. BUT THAT TRULY DOESN'T TELL THE ENTIRE WEATHER STORY. THE DEW POINT, WHICH IS THE MEASURE OF THE MOISTURE IN THE AIR HOVERING IN THE UPPER 60S. SO IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT FEEL MORE LIKE 95 WHEN YOU STEP OUTSIDE. RIGHT NOW IN BITHLO 93 IN ORLANDO, 94 IN THE VILLAGES WITH THAT HEAT AND HUMIDITY, AS WELL AS IN DAYTONA BEACH, WE DO HAVE A NICE WIND OUT OF THE WEST SOUTHWEST THAT'S JUST PUMPING IN THAT MORE HUMID AND HOT AIR OUR WAY. AND AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE SATELLITE AND RADAR THIS AFTERNOON, WE HAVE SO MUCH DRIER AIR OVER US. THAT ONE WE'RE NOT SEEING MUCH IN TERMS OF CLOUD COVER. AND TWO, WE'RE NOT TRACKING ANY RAIN. SO THAT IS NOT GOING TO HELP US. AND HELP COOLING THINGS DOWN AT ALL. THE LATEST DROUGHT MONITOR, WHICH JUST RELEASED TODAY AND NOW MORE OF CENTRAL FLORIDA, IS SEEING THE ABNORMALLY DRY CONDITIONS, WHICH IS IN THE YELLOW. PREVIOUS REPORTS WERE HEADED MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND EAST. YOU SEE SOUTHERN BREVARD AS WELL AS OSCEOLA COUNTIES ARE NOW UNDER MODERATE DROUGHT CONDITIONS. SO WE REALLY COULD USE THE RAIN. I'LL SHOW YOU WHEN WE ARE EXPECTING RAIN IN JUST A FEW SECONDS. HEADING OUT TO THE ATTRACTION TODAY. STAY HYDRATED. YOU NEED THE SUNSCREEN AS WELL. FEEL-LIKE TEMPERATURES WILL HOVER AROUND THE LOW ONE HUNDREDS THIS AFTERNOON AROUND 3:00. VERY UNCOMFORTABLE EVEN AROUND 5 TO 6:00. AND THEN TOMORROW MORNING A WARM AND MUGGY START TO THE DAY. WE ARE GOING TO START OFF IN THE LOW 70 TOMORROW FOR YOUR TGIF. HIGH TEMPERATURES STILL HANGING ON INTO THE 90S. WE'LL TALK ABOUT MID 90S FOR INLAND SPOTS, LOW 90S FOR COASTAL AREAS. HOT DAY HEAD FOR FRIDAY BUT WE ARE TRACKING OUR NEXT WEAK FRONT THAT'S EXPECTED TO ARRIVE LATE IN THE DAY TOMORROW. THAT WILL BRING US SOME RAIN. IT WILL HELP COOL US DOWN A BIT FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. IT WILL STILL BE WARM, BUT NOT NEARLY AS HOT AS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. IF YOU'RE TAKING MOM OUT FOR MOTHER'S DAY RIGHT NOW, SUNDAY LOOKS TO BE DRY. NOW WITH TOMORROW'S APPROACHING FRONT. AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM COULD BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE GUSTY SIDE. MOSTLY FOR AREAS TO THE NORTH AND WEST. RIGHT NOW THE SPC HAS MOST OF CENTRAL FLORIDA, ORLANDO ON NORTH AND WEST UNDER A LEVEL ONE RISK. WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT FOR YOU. I DON'T THINK THAT WE'LL SEE ANYTHING WIDESPREAD INTO ANYTHING IN TERMS OF STRONG TO SEVERE, BUT WE COULD SEE A GUSTY THUNDERSTORM OR TWO TOMORROW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON TO EVENING FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. HOT BOTH WEEKEND DAYS. JUST A 10% CHANCE OF RAIN ON SATURDAY. DRIER ON SUNDAY FOR MOTHER'S DAY. HERE'S A LOOK AHEAD AT YOUR EXTENDED WEATHER FORECAST. KIND OF ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN NEXT WEEK THAT'S IN KEEP SHOWERS AND STORMS AROUND AND HIGH TEMPERATURES MOSTLY IN THE UPPER 80S.

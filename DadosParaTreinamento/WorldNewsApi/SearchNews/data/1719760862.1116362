But in a new video for Vanity Fair in which former Girls co-stars Allison Williams (M3GAN) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear) reunite after seven years to revisit the show that helped launch both of them to stardom, the pair also reveal that some of the mega-cringey songs they crooned together as their characters, Marnie and Desi, were actually written by Antonoff. And, they noted, the Bleachers singer \u2014 who dated the show\u2019s star and creator, Lena Dunham, during the five-year run of the HBO series \u2014 originally wrote some of them for a major pop star who rejected the tracks. The volatile on-screen couple often played music together onscreen as they struggled through a tumultuous courtship and brief marriage, with Moss-Bachrach telling VF that he just recently learned that most of their duets were \u201cjust discards from Kelly Clarkson.\u201d \u201cI like that song,\u201d Moss-Bacharach said of \u201cBreathless,\u201d \u2014 which Antonoff reportedly wrote for Clarkson, according to Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s a great song, she should\u2019ve done it! But we got it, as a result,\u201d Williams added of the track she performed in the first episode of season four that featured the so-Marnie lyrics, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna dream if dreamin\u2019 is without you/ I don\u2019t wanna run unless I\u2019m runnin\u2019 towards you, every single thing I do is all about you.\u201d Regardless of whether you kind of disliked Marnie or actively despised her, Williams said she actually thought a lot of the couple\u2019s songs \u201cwere really beautiful,\u201d though she copped to the fact that \u201cthe lyrics are what made them cringey.\u201d She liked so many of them, but her favorite was \u201cOaxaca,\u201d the final Marnie-Desi song, which, she again notes, has lyrics that are \u201cso cringey\u201d she hardly wanted to repeat them out loud. Moss-Bachrach, however, insisted that she do so. For example: \u201cShakin\u2019 my maracas, doin\u2019 what you do/ Yeah, you\u2019ll find me in a dark bar/ Where no gringos are.\u201d \u201cMarnie singing the word \u2018gringo\u2019 should be illegal. I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to happen,\u201d Williams laughed, noting that the actors were often were really performing on screen, which was so \u201cnerve-wracking.\u201d \u201cWhat was nice that was built in, was that they were supposed to be maybe not so great,\u201d Moss-Bachrach said of the creative release valve that allowed them to lean into the cringe of lyrics he described as often \u201cguileless\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d at best. \u201cNobody had very high expectations, so that felt very safe to me just go for it.\u201d Williams said that twist made it hard to know how good they should actually try to be, with Moss-Bachrach claiming that he \u201ctried as hard as I could try.\u201d To put a finer point on it, Moss-Bachrach said the lyrics were often so bad, \u201cLeonard Cohen could sing them and they would still suck.\u201d At press time it did not appear as if Antonoff had responded to the video. Speaking of mortifying, Williams brought up the absolute peak Marnie moment when her character sang a cover of Kanye West\u2019s \u201cStronger\u201d as a torch ballad at a party to the stunned mortification of the entire room, including her friends. \u201cIt was quiet, except for my voice,\u201d she said of the ninth episode from season two. \u201cThere\u2019s no more vulnerable experience than a room full of background, silent and just your little voice in the room echoing against nothing else, singing, \u2018I\u2019ll be your white Kate Moss tonight,'\u201d Williams said.

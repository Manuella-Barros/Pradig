Too much destroyed Ballydoyle and Coolmore in the King George at Ascot, but none may well hand them today's Sussex Stakes at Goodwood.\n\nIt's a funny old game.\n\nWith Rosallion a shock absentee after being taken out on Tuesday morning, Aidan O'Brien's Henry Longfellow may well have been gifted this afternoon's one-mile Group 1 showpiece at the Glorious venue.\n\nIn the King George, Ballydoyle stable companions Hans Andersen and Luxembourg went off too fast for Auguste Rodin, but the Sussex should unravel as the opposite scenario.\n\nWith opposition which mostly likes to close in, Henry Longfellow should get a freebie on the front end and there is no one better today advantage of that than Ryan Moore.\n\nAdded to all that, Henry Longfellow is no mug either, having chased home Rosallion in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.\n\nHe's pretty useful, without being a star.\n\nRosallion had of course been turned over by Notable Speech in the 2000 Guineas, and the Godolphin runner is back after flopping in seventh at Royal Ascot.\n\nIt might just be Charlie Appleby's raider was super fit after three runs at Newmarket.\n\nOr, of course, it could have just been an off day. Only time will tell.\n\nOf the others there is still hope for Maljoom, but he really wants a strong gallop to attack.\n\nHis run in the Queen Anne was a point in the right direction.\n\nITV Racing gets under way with a 3yo handicap over 1m4f.\n\nThis is pretty open. Lots of improvers, none more so than LORD OF LOVE who battled on well up in trip to deny Wonder Kid at Newmarket last time.\n\nHe's up 4lb here but still looks raw and capable to improve more. The draw is good and he'll be hard to kick out the frame under Kieran Shoemark.\n\nI'm not judging him by Wonder Kid's run at Ascot the other day as his old rival was slowly away that day.\n\nUp in class for the Group 3 Oak Tree Stakes for fillies and mares over 7f.\n\nNot a great renewal and I see no reason why JABAARA won't score for Roger Varian and James Doyle.\n\nThe selection ran the race of her life to chase home Porta Fortuna in the Group 1 Falmouth last time.\n\nThat was over a mile, but she was good over this trip in her previous two starts and the ground will be no issue and might be a little faster than Kathmandu would like.\n\nThe other race on ITV is for sprinting juveniles in the Group 3 Molecomb over 5f.\n\nI suspect AESTERIUS is very good and he could be another for Doyle but this time for Archie Watson.\n\nThe son of Mehmas was a good winner on debut at Bath and went to Royal Ascot finishing a fair fifth to another Wathnan Racing horse in Shareholder in the Norfolk.\n\nAesterius was actually a shorter price than his owner companion that day and he impressed me at Sandown last time.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe three-year-old opened up with three successive wins on the all-weather at Kempton before making a statement victory in the 2000 Guineas, when he won by a length-and-a-half from Rosallion at Newmarket.\n\nThe Dubawi colt, going off as favourite, finished down the field in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot last month as old rival Rosallion took that Group One triumph by a neck.\n\nThe leading pair were set to go head-to-head once again today, but Richard Hannon's charge was declared a non-runner shortly after 11am yesterday, with a respiratory infection put forward as the reason, meaning Charlie Appleby's star only faces four challengers.\n\nOne of those is St James's Palace runner-up Henry Longfellow for Aidan O'Brien and jockey Ryan Moore, with

Group Two level in the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot but saw fellow Wathnan Racing-owned Shareholder take the honours as he galloped home in fifth, but not beaten far.\n\nA drop in grade to Listed

'We have to put his welfare at the very top of our priorities. He'll miss this one but there is still a big chunk of the season to come.'\n\nThat maybe so but that doesn't mean it's easier for Hannon or his owner, Sheikh Mohamed Obaid al-Maktoum. This wasn't lost on Appleby, who expects a bold show in the Sussex from his 2000 Guineas winner Notable Speech.\n\n'My heart goes out to Richard, Sheikh Obaid and all the team connected with the horse' said Appleby. 'I have been in his position plenty of times and I know how it feels. It's frustrating for everyone became we all want to see competition.'\n\nThat chimed with O'Brien. Thrilled as he was with Kyprios, whose career record now stands at 12 wins from 16 starts, his longing to see Henry Longfellow and Rosallion go head-to-head again after their Royal Ascot tussle was apparent.\n\nA neck separated the pair in the St James's Palace Stakes and confidence within Ballydoyle behind Henry Longfellow has been growing since last weekend. Without Rosallion, however, a little sheen has been removed.\n\n'I'm very disappointed,' O'Brien agreed. 'You want the best horses in, don't you? Win, lose or draw, it's the spectacle - and that's what keeps people coming back to racing. If you win every day, it just becomes boring - for everyone.\n\n'We'd try to win every day but there has to be new people, new horses for people to talk and write about it. Then you can discuss it and have opinions.

But he misfired badly at Royal Ascot in the St James's Palace Stakes as Rosallion beat Henry Longfellow to land Group One glory. With Rosallion missing from the Sussex field due to a setback, St James's Palace Stakes runner-up Henry Longfellow was sent off the 11-10 favourite. But having led for a long way the Aidan O'Brien's three-year-old had no answer to late burst of speed of the Charlie Appleby-trained Notable Speech. Travelling supremely well off the pace, under Liverpool FC fan William Buick, Notable Speech cruised through after the cutaway and ran out a brilliant winner of the Group One feature on day two at Goodwood. The William Haggas-trained Maljoom (11-2) was second a length-and-a-half adrift, with last year's runner-up Facteur Cheval not far behind in third for French trainer Jerome Reynier. Notable Speech became the first 2,000 Guineas winner to follow up in the Sussex Stakes in the same season since the great Frankel in 2010.\n\nA delighted Buick said: \"He was just firing on all cylinders coming in here today. He was a brilliant Guineas winner with a very rare turn of foot, one you very rarely see, and we saw that again today. I'm delighted. Full credit to the team. They've done such a fantastic job to get him back after a disappointing run in the St James's Palace Stakes, where we knew it was too bad to be true. He's such a brilliant horse. He's a horse that really excites you and it's a real privilege to ride him.\"\n\nFrench Duke (16-5 favourite) won the opener, the Coral Daily Rewards Shaker Handicap, under James Doyle. Roger Varian's Wathnan Racing-owned son of Sea The Stars just got the better of the John and Thady Gosden-trained Lord Of Love (9-2) by a neck with Gallantly staying on for third a further three-and-threequarters-of-a-length adrift. French Duke, who had been sixth behind Going The Distance in the King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot, finally got off the mark on his fifth start. Wearing a hood for the first time under Doyle, Wathnan's retained rider, French Duke came through to battle with the eventual runner-up and grab victory.\n\nTrainer Varian said: \"He's still learning the game, he's a bit raw and immature. After Ascot, where he ran his race upside down, we really wanted to see him finish today. In doing so, at a medium gallop on fast ground, we were probably further back than James wanted to be. The horse is still learning but he showed toughness there, I think I would upgrade that performance. For me he is not the finished article but it was nice to see him tough it out today. If you watch the race at Ascot, he ran huge that day but he did too much and moved too early in the race. Today it was very important that he hit the line strong.\"\n\nRaqiya (7-1) was awarded victory following a stewards' inquiry in the Group Three Visit Qatar Oak Tree Stakes. The 5-2 favourite Jabaara crossed the line in first, under James Doyle, but following interference it was the Owen Burrows-trained Raqiya who claimed victory as the placings were reversed. Breege and Kathmandu make much of the running with the Roger Varian-trained Jabaara racing wide behind them. Jabaara burst clear to hit the front, but as he crossed over, Crowley had to check his run on the rail on board Raqiya. Raqiya battled on to get within a head down of Jabaara. But after the stewards' inquiry in which both jockeys gave their opinions, it was decided to reverse the placings. Ziggy's Dream (50-1) was half-a-length back in third with Vetivier (11-2) a short-head further adrift in fourth.\n\nBurrows said: \"Roger is one of my best mates and it is never nice to win one like that. Jim felt we would have won with a clear run, and watching it a few times on the big screen, we probably felt we would have been an unlucky loser, but that is the way it goes here sometimes. It was there for all to see. It would have been a bit gutting not to get it. The most positive thing even if we didn't get it is that we learned seven furlongs on fast ground is her bag. That was a big positive to take out of it.\"\n\nCrowley said during the enquiry: \"I've had to wait until the cutaway and my filly is picking up. We've got the rail to run against and we've got plenty of clear room to go. The horse in front has just shifted across her and I've had to switch. I think she's lost a bit of momentum, I've had to check, then obviously she has stayed on again. I feel that, if that hadn't happened, she probably would have won. I stopped for about three strides. There's no question we have had to stop. Four strides, easily, and then you have lost your momentum. She's made up a length and a half. With a clear run and, without losing her momentum, she would have won.\"\n\nDoyle added: \"There is no question, when I have let my filly go, she has looked for company and gone right-hand down until she has got to the rail. I felt at the time she has crossed onto the rail, Jim hasn't had to check and come out. So I don't feel that it has affected his momentum whatsoever. Jim has had to just ease off for a run but he hasn't had to check, halt and then come out for a run. When I have actually passed him, I don't feel like I am an any way in his space. The way she kicked, I felt that she had kicked really clear and I still maintain that she has. I know Jim has said he has stopped riding - he's trying to come out and I think his filly wants to lie in on the rail. She's (Jabaara) kicked clear and I don't feel that I am ever in his space - he's just had to switch because he is finishing and he's had to come out for a run. I think my filly is the best filly because she has kicked clear, she has completely shut down from the minute she's hit the front - she has wandered right up against that rail and completely stopped. She did feel the second coming and found at the line.\"\n\nTrainer Varian said of Jabaara: \"I have only seen the race once and I don't want to comment on the interference or the stewards' decision - they have had the luxury of watching it many more times and from more angles than we have and they have come to that decision and we have to congratulate the winner. It's a shame. I think our filly was on top for most of the race, and maybe she just threw it away. I don't know what else to say - she ran well.\"\n\nTom Palin of Middleham Park Racing, co-owners of Ziggy's Dream, said: \"Sometimes if you are third at 6-4, you are a bit disappointed, but at 50-1 you are absolutely delighted. She has a couple of races abroad - one in Cologne and one at Naas. We will kick on.\"\n\nMick Appleby's Big Mojo (25-1) emulated star stable-mate Big Evs and landed a blistering victory in the Group Three Jaeger-Lecoultre Molecomb Stakes. In the same colours of owners RP Racing Ltd, the speedy Mohaater colt built on his debut second to Uncle Don on his debut at Beverley last month to land the five-furlong sprint in course record time on the good to firm going. Under Silvestre De Sousa, Big Mojo was sat just off the pace set by. But coming to the final furlong, he burst through and stayed on superbly to win three-quarters-of-a-length from the Archie Watson-trained 2-1 favourite Aesterius, under James Doyle. Mr Lightside (11-1) was ahead back in third and Celandine (11-2) was a further length-and-a-quarter further adrift in fourth.\n\nBig Evs went on to Grade One glory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint at Santa Anita, and was third in the King Charles III Stakes at Royal Ascot last month. He is a top-class sprinter and trainer Appleby believes Big Mojo could be just as good as his older stable-mate Big Evs, who goes for more Goodwood glory in the Group Two King George V Stakes on Friday.\n\nAppleby said: \"I do hold him in the same regard as Big Evs, but I couldn't split him and Mr Lightside. They're two very, very good two-year-olds. It's great for the owner to have another good horse and it's great for us, too. I did say he could be as good as Big Evs, he's a good horse, a very good horse. Him and Mr Lightside, I couldn't split them as I think they're both very good. I worked them together the other day and I couldn't pick between them. He's run a blinder as well. They're both very good two-year-olds. They wouldn't be far behind Big Evs either as two-year-olds. They could both go to America for the Breeders' Cup, but Big Mojo will go to the Gimcrack (at York) first. The owner wants his wife to do the speech as the winning owner at the Gimcrack dinner.

He went to Beverley first time out, he was a little bit green but he ran really well. He's made such an improvement, we were going to put him in the maiden but we said to Mick 'put him in the Molecomb, he's good enough'.\"\n\nAsked whether there would now be a temptation to cash in on Big Mojo, he insisted: \"We're in racing to win, we're not in it to sell horses on.

Group One Sussex Stakes (3.35pm) is a race that has gone to the favourite on six of the last 10 years, and four of those have been sent off odds-on.\n\nThat might well have been the case again this year had ante-post favourite Rosallion not been ruled out yesterday due to a respiratory infection and his absence looks to have left the door open for Henry Longfellow and NOTABLE SPEECH.\n\nIt was the Ballydoyle horse that chased Rosallion home in the St James's Palace at Royal Ascot but Notable Speech was sent off favourite that day and clearly didn't perform to the level he did when winning the 2000 Guineas.\n\nIt's worth forgiving that effort and on the back of it he offers better value than Henry Longfellow in the market.\n\nThe quick ground at Goodwood will also be more to his liking than his main market rival, who would probably prefer a bit more ease in the surface.\n\nFrench raider Facteur Cheval, who finished second to Paddington in last year's renewal, is the other runner of note.\n\nHe was a Group One winner of the Dubai Turf at Meydan in March, but that came over nine furlongs and his tactical speed is likely to be tested over this sharp mile, especially on quick ground.\n\nI think Notable Speech is the bet here at around 7/4, and if playing on the World Pool at tote.co.uk we are almost sure to beat SP, with the good chance of an overpay too.\n\nThe best betting race on today's card is the Molecomb Stakes (3:00pm), a five-furlong dash for two-year-olds.\n\nAMESTRIS looks a big price here for a filly that showed plenty of ability on her first two starts, winning impressively on the second of those at Lingfield before being pitched into the Queen Mary at the Royal Meeting.\n\nShe wasn't unfancied for that Group Two contest and never really had clear daylight to run into when finishing off well from the back of the field.\n\nConsidering she was only beaten six lengths at the line it was a fair effort and she would have finished closer if not getting caught on the heels of rivals.\n\nAt around 25/1 in places, Michael Bell's filly looks overpriced and I'll be siding with her in World Pool's Win and Place markets.\n\nAnother I'll be playing, again both Win and Place with World Pool, is Archie Watson's VINGEGAARD.\n\nThis son of Mehmas also emerged from Royal Ascot with credit after finishing fifth in the Windsor Castle.\n\nHe led inside the final furlong of that contest but faded up the stiff finish at the Berkshire venue.\n\nClearly blessed with plenty of pace, he again hit the front last time out in Newbury's Super Sprint only to go down by a neck at the line to a fast-finishing rival.\n\nThe speed he's shown previously should allow him to lead or race prominently here and make full use of a good stands rail draw in stall 16, while the downhill nature of the track will also mean he should have more chance of lasting home than at Ascot or Newbury.\n\nArchie Watson's other runner, AESTERIUS, is also drawn to attack from stall 10.\n\nHe looks perhaps the most likely winner, having showed a lightning turn of foot to land the Dragon Stakes at Sandown last time.\n\nHis price of around 5/2 is too short for me though, and instead I'll be bundling him up in a Quinella (pick the first two home) along with main selections Amestris and Vingegaard.\n\nAesterius, Vingegaard, Amestris (Quinella) 3.00pm Goodwood", "source":

But having attempted to make all, Aidan O'Brien's Ascot runner-up looked a sitting duck at the cutaway.\n\nWilliam Buick was sat with a double handful on Notable Speech and just like he had shown at Newmarket, the Dubawi colt quickened up in an instant and put the race to bed in a matter of strides.\n\nIn doing so the 3-1 chance emulated Frankel, who was the last Guineas winner to win the Sussex Stakes in the same season.\n\nThe William Haggas-trained Maljoom stayed on to finish second, a length and a half away, with last year's second Facteur Cheval close-up in third for Jerome Reynier.\n\nA delighted Buick said: \"He was just firing on all cylinders coming in here today. He was a brilliant Guineas winner with a very rare turn of foot, one you very rarely see, and we saw that again today.\n\n\"I'm delighted. Full credit to the team. They've done such a fantastic job to get him back after a disappointing run in the St James's Palace Stakes, where we knew it was too bad to be true.\n\n\"He's such a brilliant horse. He's a horse that really excites you and it's a real privilege to ride him.\"\n\nRaqiya (7-1) got the verdict over Jabaara in the stewards' room following a dramatic running of the Visit Qatar Oak Tree Stakes.\n\nBreege and Kathmandu had disputed the lead for the majority of the Group Three contest, with Roger Varian's favourite Jabaara racing wide.\n\nThe market leader showed a real turn of foot when asked by James Doyle, bursting to the front. But in doing so she did go to her right and towards the rail, meaning Jim Crowley had to check on the Owen Burrows-trained Raqiya.\n\nRaqiya finished strongly, but was a head down on Jabaara at the line. The stewards subsequently interviewed both riders and took the view that the result had been impacted.\n\nBurrows said: \"Roger is one of my best mates and it is never nice to win one like that.\n\n\"Jim felt if we had had a clear run, we would have won and watching it a few times on the big screen, we probably felt we would have been an unlucky loser. But that is the way it goes here sometimes.\n\n\"It was there for all to see. It would have been a bit gutting not to get it.\n\n\"The most positive thing, even if we didn't get it, is that we learned seven furlongs on fast ground is her bag. That was a big positive to take out of it.\"\n\nBig Mojo (25-1) showed a smart turn of pace to come out on top in the Jaeger-Lecoultre Molecomb Stakes.\n\nHis stablemate Mr Lightside carried the Group Three field through the early stages as they raced down the centre of the course, with Arran in isolation alongside the near-side rail.\n\nThe Mick Appleby-trained Big Mojo - representing last year's winning connections of Big Evs - raced in cover in midfield before being asked to challenge as they approached the final furlong.\n\nBig Mojo put on the jets to pull clear of Mr Lightside and win by three-quarters of a length in the hands of Silvestre de Sousa, with the fast-finishing favourite Aesterius getting up to claim second on the line by a head.\n\nAppleby said: \"I do hold him in the same regard as Big Evs, but I couldn't split him and Mr Lightside. They're two very, very good two-year-olds. It's great for the owner to have another good horse and it's great for us, too.\n\n\"I did say he could be as good as Big Evs, he's a good horse, a very good horse.\n\n\"Him and Mr Lightside, I couldn't split them as I think they're both very good. I worked them together the other day and I couldn't pick between them. He's run a blinder as well. They're both very good two-year-olds.\n\n\"They wouldn't be far behind Big Evs either as two-year-olds.

We had him checked out by the vets afterwards and nothing came to light.\n\n\"He looks fantastic at the moment and we couldn't be happier with his work. He has been showing us all the right signs and we're very much looking forward to it.\"\n\nHenry Longfellow arrives on the back of a career-best second in the St James's Palace, and trainer Aidan O'Brien feels he has taken a step forward since that effort.\n\nThree of Henry Longfellow's five starts have been in group 1s, and he finished almost six lengths in front of Notable Speech at Royal Ascot.\n\nRyan Moore's mount was a five-length winner of the National Stakes (G1) at the Curragh in his final start at 2. Although the Poule d'Essai des Poulains (G1) failed to pan out favorably (eighth of 13 as the 13-10 favorite) on his return in May, he was back to form when beaten just a neck last time.\n\nO'Brien said: \"His run in France was basically a non-event and he got nothing out of it, so we're treating this like his second run of the season.\n\n\"His first real race was in the St James's Palace and we thought he ran a lovely race there. We think he has come forward from that at home and he seems to be progressing nicely. Everyone is happy with him.\"\n\nLast year's second, Facteur Cheval , heads the older opposition and should not be overlooked.\n\nFacteur Cheval returned this year with a breakthrough group 1 success in the Dubai Turf (G1T) at Meydan on good ground in March.\n\nMaxime Guyon's mount was only sixth when the 7-2 second favorite for the Queen Anne (G1) at Royal Ascot on good to firm last month but it is a run his trainer, Jerome Reynier, is happy to put a line through.\n\nReynier said: \"Everything went wrong for him at Ascot -- the ground was too fast, but more importantly he was on the wrong side of the track and he lost a shoe. It was a run to forget as he has otherwise been very consistent, including when he ran really well in this race last year, and he's in good shape.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_haynes@bloodhorse.com", "name": "Jack Haynes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup_Challenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup Challenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James's_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St James's Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Appleby_(racehorse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Appleby (racehorse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup_Mile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup Mile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godolphin_(racing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godolphin (racing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmarket,_Suffolk", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newmarket, Suffolk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newmarket, Suffolk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James's_Palace_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St James's Palace Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aidan O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_(horse_racing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Going (horse racing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai Turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Guyon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxime Guyon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poule_d'Essai_des_Poulains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poule d'Essai des Poulains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meydan_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meydan Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_O'Brien_National_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vincent O'Brien National Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curragh_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curragh Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Moore_(jockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Moore (jockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-images.bloodhorse.com/i/bloodhorse-images/2024/05/7046b3b1971e41e39ab9cf0929d1d5cb.jpg?preset=facebook", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776618", "eventUri": "eng-9776618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 236, "textEnd": 243}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-02", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 367}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 232035508, "title": "BREAKING: Tommy Hartigan is youngest candidate elected but is still not most famous family member!", "text": "TOMMY Hartigan has been elected a councillor in the Adare-Rathkeale at the tender age of 23 for Independent Ireland. However, the Pallaskenry man says he still isn\u2019t the most famous member of his family as his mum Hazel was in Operation Transformation. \u201cI'd say she's still the most famous member. She went national. I'm staying local for now. \"Without the family I wouldn't have been able to do this. They\u2019re very proud and I'm very proud of them too. They backed me to the very last and it paid off,\u201d said Cllr Hartigan, who added that he is feeling relieved and satisfied. \u201cIt was a hard road, it was a long road, but we got there in the end. I\u2019m delighted it's over and looking forward to getting working now.\u201d What made him throw in his cards with Richard O'Donoghue and Independent Ireland? \u201cI just felt that he was offering something that wasn't out there - a common sense approach. Common sense will solve a lot of problems and with the backing that was there of the Independents I felt it was the right move. \u201cI couldn't align with any particular party because I didn't believe in them as a party to join with. Richard offered me an alternative.\u201d Cllr Hartigan received a big vote of 1,217 number ones. \u201cIt was a serious vote. I had planned on staying away but when the first couple of boxes were open, the reports were starting to come in. I tried to ignore the messages and the phone calls but I still came up for curiosity. It got the better of me and the result was absolutely amazing for a first time candidate. \"I'm absolutely delighted with the result,\u201d said Cllr Hartigan.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_09/ilim_Tommy_Hartigan_elected_9-6-24-1717945402519.jpg--.jpg?1717945405403\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />TOMMY Hartigan has been elected a councillor in the Adare-Rathkeale at the tender age of 23 for Independent Ireland.

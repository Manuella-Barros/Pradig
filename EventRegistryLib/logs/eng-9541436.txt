These are on top of any refunds and other compensation affected passengers may have already received from Qantas.\n\nThe ACCC took Qantas to court in August 2023 over these flights:\n\nACCC Takes Qantas To Court For Selling Tickets To Flights That Had Already Been Cancelled\n\nACCC's Press Release:\n\nQantas (ASX: QAN) has admitted that it misled consumers by advertising tickets for tens of thousands of flights it had already decided to cancel, and by cancelling thousands more flights without promptly telling ticketholders of its decision, after court action by the ACCC.\n\nAs part of an agreement announced today, the ACCC and Qantas will ask the Federal Court to impose a penalty of $100 million on Qantas for breaching the Australian Consumer Law.\n\nQantas has also agreed in a court-enforceable undertaking to pay about $20 million to more than 86,000 customers who were sold tickets on flights that Qantas had already decided to cancel, or in some cases who were reaccommodated on these flights after their original flights were cancelled.\n\nQantas will pay $225 to domestic ticketholders and $450 to international ticketholders. These payments are on top of any remedies these consumers already received from Qantas, such as alternative flights or refunds.\n\n\"We are pleased to have secured these admissions by Qantas that it misled its customers, and its agreement that a very significant penalty is required as a result of this conduct. The size of this proposed penalty is an important milestone in enforcing the Australian Consumer Law,\" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\n\"Qantas' conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled.\"\n\n\"We expect that this penalty, if accepted by the Court, will send a strong deterrence message to other companies. Importantly, it demonstrates that we take action to ensure that companies operating in Australia communicate clearly, accurately and honestly with their customers at all times,\" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\n\"We note that Qantas has also agreed not to repeat this type of conduct in the future, and to make payments as soon as possible to the thousands of consumers who purchased tickets on flights that Qantas had already decided to cancel, or were re-accommodated onto these flights after their original flight was cancelled.\"\n\nThe ACCC launched Federal Court action against Qantas in August 2023 alleging that, between 21 May 2021 and 7 July 2022, Qantas advertised tickets for more than 8,000 cancelled flights. It was also alleged that, for more than 10,000 flights scheduled to depart in May to July 2022, Qantas did not promptly notify existing ticketholders that their flights had been cancelled.\n\nQantas has now admitted that its misconduct continued from 21 May 2021 until 26 August 2023, affecting tens of thousands of flights scheduled to depart between 1 May 2022 and 10 May 2024.\n\n\"We acknowledge Qantas' cooperation in ultimately deciding not to contest this case, admitting that the conduct occurred for a longer period, and seeking to resolve this early and for the benefit of consumers,\" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\nQantas has also undertaken to notify customers of cancelled flights as soon as practicable, and no more than 48 hours from deciding to cancel the flight. It has also undertaken to stop selling cancelled flights as soon as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours of its decision to cancel. The undertaking also applies to its low-cost subsidiary, Jetstar.\n\nQantas will also review its consumer compliance program and appoint independent auditors who will monitor Qantas' compliance with the undertaking and provide reports to the Qantas board and the ACCC.\n\nSummary of the agreement\n\nUnder the agreement with the ACCC, Qantas:\n\nThe Court will determine the penalty after a hearing on a date to be fixed.\n\nQantas has also agreed to pay a contribution towards the ACCC's costs.\n\nPayments to affected consumers\n\nQantas will facilitate payments to 86,597 consumers who, between 21 May 2021 and 26 August 2023, booked, or were re\u2011accommodated on, a domestic or international flight scheduled to depart between 1 May 2022 until 10 May 2024 after Qantas had already decided to cancel it.\n\nThe total value of the payment scheme is expected to be approximately $20 million.\n\nQantas will contact affected consumers to inform them about the payment scheme by 10 July 2024, and consumers should direct queries about the scheme to Qantas.\n\nConsumers will receive communications from Qantas and Deloitte Australia, which is administering the payments on behalf of Qantas, via email and text message, providing information on accessing a portal to facilitate the payment.\n\nConsumers should be aware of scammers pretending to make contact on behalf of Qantas or Deloitte. Consumers should only provide their personal information through the official claims portal, and not to anyone else.\n\nThe undertaking offered by Qantas, and accepted by the ACCC, is available online at Qantas Airways Ltd.\n\nBackground\n\nQantas is Australia's largest domestic airline operator. It is a publicly listed company which operates domestic and international passenger flights under its mainline brand, Qantas, and through its subsidiary Jetstar. It offers flights for sale through direct channels, such as its website and app, and indirect channels, such as travel agents and third-party online booking websites.\n\nThe ACCC commenced its court action against Qantas on 1 August 2023.\n\nThe Qantas Group has today announced an agreement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to resolve court proceedings in relation to flight cancellation processes.\n\nUnder the settlement agreed with the ACCC, Qantas will commence a projected $20 million remediation program for impacted passengers, with payments to customers ranging from $225 to $450, and subject to the approval of the Federal Court of Australia, will pay a $100 million civil penalty.\n\nThe ACCC and Qantas will shortly seek approval of the proposed penalty by the Federal Court. However, Qantas intends to commence the remediation program in advance of the Court approval process.\n\nQantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said: \"Today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier.\n\n\"When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry. The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.\n\n\"We have since updated our processes and are investing in new technology across the Qantas Group to ensure this doesn't happen again.\n\n\"We thank the ACCC for their cooperation in reaching this outcome, which means we can compensate affected customers much sooner than if the case had continued in the Federal Court. We are focused on making the remediation process as quick and seamless as possible for customers.\"\n\nThe ACCC's case related to flight cancellation practices following the restart of operations post-COVID, which has been extended through to the end of August 2023, when steps were taken to ensure that processing of cancellation decisions occurred promptly.\n\nThe ACCC is no longer proceeding with its claims against Qantas about wrongful acceptance of payment, including any allegation that Qantas received payment for a service it did not, and had no intention of, providing.\n\nAll affected customers were given the option of a refund or an alternate flight.\n\nCustomer remediation program\n\nMore than 86,000 customers who made a booking on a flight two or more days after the cancellation decision had been made will be compensated as part of this program. Those impacted customers will receive $225 for domestic/trans-Tasman flights and $450 for international flights. This is on top of any refund or alternative flight already offered to these customers.\n\nPayments will be available through a dedicated online portal facilitated by professional services firm, Deloitte, and will be independently audited. Qantas will be notifying impacted customers via email from next month\n\nwith details about how they can lodge a claim. Further information can be found at www.qantasremediation.deloitte.com.au\n\nOf customers affected, 94 per cent were flying on domestic or trans-Tasman routes, with the remainder flying on the international network. More than 80 per cent of passengers on domestic services were offered an alternative flight departing prior to or within three hours of the scheduled departure time. More than 60 per cent of passengers on international services were offered an alternative flight departing prior to or within 12 hours of the scheduled departure time.\n\nFinancial\n\nThe impact of the remediation program and penalty will be recognised as an expense in the Group's Statutory Income Statement for the year ended 30 June 2024. The expense will be recognised as an item outside of Underlying PBT.\n\nThe timing of the cash outflow in relation to the remediation program and penalty is expected to occur after 30 June 2024 and therefore will not materially impact Net Debt or Free Cash Flow for the FY24 financial year and will occur instead in the FY25 financial year.[1]\n\n[1] On the assumption that the remediation and penalty will be paid in FY25.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet's be frank. Qantas didn't only let passengers down or mislead them; this was outright fraud.\n\nQantas sold tickets to flights it had no intention of operating, only to collect cash from the unsuspecting public.\n\nThe airline also was very difficult to get refunds for other flights it canceled during the pandemic, and only issued IOUs first (airline credits).\n\nI like that the ACCC in Australia issues significant fines, unlike the DOT in the US, which may actually affect how these businesses operate.\n\nI am glad that passengers who were caught in this fraud will receive a cash payment of A$225 to A$450 from Qantas instead of vouchers or other forms of funny money.", "source": {"uri": "loyaltylobby.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LoyaltyLobby"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_ollila@loyaltylobby.com", "name": "John Ollila", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetstar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jetstar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Tasman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trans-Tasman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voucher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voucher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web portal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://loyaltylobby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Qantas-Alan-Joyce.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

However, Qantas intends to commence the remediation program in advance of the Court approval process,\" the statement said.\n\nThe chair of the ACCC, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said as part of the settlement Qantas had admitted that it misled consumers. \"Qantas's conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,\" Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\nShe said Qantas had also undertaken to \"not engage in this type of conduct in the future\".\n\nThe Qantas CEO, Vanessa Hudson, said \"today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier ... we have since updated our processes and are investing in new technology across the Qantas Group to ensure this doesn't happen again\".\n\nQantas will facilitate payments to 86,597 consumers who, between 21 May 2021 and 26 August 2023, booked or were re\u2011accommodated on a domestic or international flight scheduled to depart between 1 May 2022 until 10 May 2024 after Qantas had already decided to cancel it.\n\nOf customers affected, 94% were flying on domestic or trans-Tasman routes, with the remainder flying on the international network. The financial hit of the penalty and remediation program would be recognised as an expense in the group's statutory income statement for the current financial year.\n\nIn August, the ACCC lodged proceedings in the federal court alleging Qantas was continuing to advertise and sell tickets for more than 8,000 flights on its website for an average of two weeks, and in some cases up to 47 days, after cancelling the flights.\n\nThe ACCC closely monitored the airline's flight data between May and July 2022, finding the carrier cancelled about 15,000 out of 66,000 domestic and international services - almost one in four flights.\n\nThe watchdog also alleged that for more than 10,000 flights scheduled over the same period in 2022, \"Qantas did not notify existing ticketholders that their flights had been cancelled for an average of about 18 days, and in some cases for up to 48 days\".\n\nQantas, in its defence to the legal action, claimed it doesn't sell customers tickets to any particular flight, but rather a \"bundle of rights\" that includes alternative options in the event of cancellations, as it responded to allegations it sold tickets to thousands of already cancelled flights.\n\nThe airline also claimed that informing customers that it had already cancelled flights they were booked on would have created \"uncertainty and frustration\" and overwhelmed its phone lines, as the airline accused the competition watchdog of ignoring the realities of the aviation industry.\n\nPrior to the settlement, Cass-Gottlieb had said she wanted to see Qantas hit with penalties of at least $250m, twice the current record penalty.\n\nThe $120m financial hit comes amid a profitable period for Qantas. In February, Hudson handed down a $1.25bn half-year pre-tax profit in her first financial results leading the airline, and rewarded shareholders with a $400m buyback after a tumultuous period that unseated her predecessor. The profit result was tracking 13% down from the record $2.47bn full-year profit posted in 2022-23.\n\nSeparately, Qantas is still awaiting the outcome of federal court proceedings to determine how much compensation it must pay over the illegal outsourcing of 1,700 ground handlers early on in the pandemic, after losing repeated appeals to have the finding against it overturned. The union bringing the case has suggested compensation could exceed $100m.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elias_visontay@theguardian.com", "name": "Elias Visontay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Joyce_(executive)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Joyce (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Hudson_(executive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Hudson (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Tasman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans-Tasman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03503d67f241f01c814afeb945b58038580a787b/11_0_4510_2706/master/4510.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=f4f7e7d95b48ffc58d00c61b9f344a91", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

The airline was accused of selling tickets for flights that were already cancelled. The scandal also extended to the company inadequately informing customers about these cancellations, and providing flight credits with expiration dates for trips affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAllegations against Qantas included a delay in notifying ticket holders about cancellations, with an average notification period of 18 days for 10,000 flights. As a result, several consumers had to suffer through botched and inconvenient attempts at rescheduling, even resulting in financial loss for many.\n\nAs per the West Australian, the ACCC pursued Qantas through the federal court, alleging that the airline sold tickets for over 8,000 flights between May and June of 2022, despite these flights already being cancelled.\n\nAt the time of the investigation, the airline was already faced scrutiny on multiple fronts, including criticism for exorbitant ticket prices, accusations of below-par service quality, and the controversial dismissal of 1,700 ground staff amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen the accusations were first levelled, Qantas denied any wrongdoing\n\nDefending its decision to sell seats on cancelled flights, the airlines argued that instead of purchasing tickets for individual seats, customers acquire a \"bundle of rights\" and a commitment from the airline to \"do its best to get consumers where they want to be on time\". It may be noted that Qantas recorded an annual profit of $1.1 billion last year, marking a significant financial recovery following the turbulence in travel brought on by the pandemic.\n\nACCC investigation findings\n\nAt the end of the ACCC investigation, the airline acknowledged that it did indulge in such malpractices May 2021 and August 2023, a period that also coincided with the most severe stages of the pandemic. The ACCC described Qantas' conduct as \"egregious and unacceptable.\"\n\nAs part of a settlement agreement between Qantas and the ACCC, 86,000 impacted customers will receive $13 million in compensation. The aforementioned $66 million fine is subject to approval from the federal court.\n\nDuring a press conference, ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb stated that the commission opted to settle to sidestep \"legal semantics\" and emphasised the importance of prioritising customer reimbursement.\n\n\"In the interest of getting an early settlement and the additional payments and compensation to customers, we are no longer taking forward a requirement that they admit to a contravention of selling the service and receiving payment with no intention of providing the service,\" Ms Cass-Gottlieb said, adding \"It's very interesting what legal semantics might be saying, what we consider as very important is that Qantas is admitting that it misled customers by continuing to sell tickets on flights they had already decided to cancel.\"\n\nQantas' explanation and plans for future\n\nWhile Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson stated that the company did provide adequate support to customers, she added the airline intended to commence remediation efforts prior to court approval, The Chronicle quoted her as saying.\n\n\"Today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier. When flying resumed after the Covid shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry. We have since updated our processes and are investing in new technology across the Qantas Group to ensure this doesn't happen again. We are focused on making the remediation process as quick and seamless as possible for customers,\" Ms Hudson.\n\nShe added, \"The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.\"\n\nAbout the fine, ACC's Ms Cass-Gottlieb said: \"This $100m [Australian dollars] penalty, if accepted by the Federal Court, will send a strong message to Australian companies that they must comply with the Australian Consumer Law.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Cass-Gottlieb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gina Cass-Gottlieb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Consumer_Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Consumer Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/th20f8m_qantas_625x300_03_September_18.jpg?ver-20240430.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

They are accepting and admitting that they misled customers by selling tickets represented on the basis of the continuation of a flight at a particular time,\" ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\nQantas has also promised to stop selling cancelled flights within 24 hours of its decision to cancel, as well as to notify customers of cancelled flights no more than 48 hours from deciding to cancel the flight, in commitments that also apply to its budget carrier Jetstar.\n\nDoes this mean that travellers can now have more confidence in their booking? And will the warning that date and time of departure do not form part of a customer's contract with the airline now vanish from Qantas' booking websites?\n\nHudson, when pressed on this, could make no guarantees.\n\n\"Even on the ACCC's website, it notes that airlines cannot guarantee specific flight times on specific dates,\" she said.\n\nThe total amount of the settlement may have left some of Qantas' fiercest critics wondering if the airline got off lightly.\n\nRelated: Big business in Australia faces less competition than almost anywhere else - and likes it that way | John Quiggin\n\nInitially Cass-Gottlieb had been seeking $250m in penalties but on Monday said she was satisfied with the lesser penalty because it secured an early settlement, admissions of misconduct and the commitments to improve in the future.\n\nQantas' strong financial position of late - in February Hudson handed down a $1.25bn half-year pre-tax profit and rewarded shareholders with a $400m buyback, after a record $2.47bn full-year profit in 2022-23 - suggests the airline can absorb the $120m hit.\n\nIn cutting a deal with the ACCC - which has identified Qantas as the most complained about company for two years running - Hudson has saved the airline potentially hundreds of millions of dollars and spared it from a protracted legal dispute with negative coverage. (The cost of the alternative, Joyce-era approach will play out shortly when Qantas learns how much compensation - expected to exceed $100m - it must pay over the illegal outsourcing of 1,700 ground handlers that it fought tooth and nail to overturn.)\n\nDespite this, the settlement is a clear success for the ACCC.\n\nIts allegations set the public debate about Qantas' dominance into overdrive, triggered talk about increasing competition and consumer protections in aviation, with discussion of a mandatory cash compensation scheme for delays - something Qantas fiercely opposes - raised in Canberra ahead of the upcoming aviation white paper.\n\nTo this end, even if they're not one of the 86,597 customers set to receive payments from Qantas, the travelling Australian public are also set to reap the rewards of the ACCC's case.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Compensation for over 86,000 affected customers. CEO Vanessa Hudson aims to restore public confidence in Qantas, acknowledges past failures, and updates technology and processes. Settlement stems from ACCC's allegations of deceptive conduct by Qantas advertising flights it had already canceled. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nIn August last year, Australian flag carrier Qantas posted an underlying profit of AU$2.47 billion ($1.63b) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023, after losing around AU$7 billion ($4.62b) in the previous three years. Rather than basking in a warm afterglow, within weeks, long-serving CEO Alan Joyce was marched out the door, and Australia's competition regulator launched legal action accusing the airline of selling tickets for flights it already knew were canceled.\n\nQantas looks for redemption\n\nAfter months of discussions, the Qantas Group announced today that it had reached an agreement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to settle the legal proceedings related to this flight cancellation issue. Under the terms of the settlement, Qantas will make remediation payments totaling AU$20 million ($13.2m) to affected passengers and pay an AU$100 million ($66m) civil penalty, subject to the deal being approved by the Federal Court of Australia.\n\nPhoto: G Tipene | Shutterstock\n\nToday's statement contrasts sharply with Qantas's comments when it filed its defense in October. Then it admitted that mistakes were made but said that the ACCC's case ignores the realities of the aviation industry - airlines can't guarantee specific flight times. It added that all customers on canceled flights were offered an alternative flight or refund, and there was no 'fee for no service.'\n\nRelated Flight Review: Flying Both Inaugural Qantas Airbus A220 Services Today, the two Qantas Airbus A220s made their commercial debut, and it was a roaring success with the passengers, crew, and the airline.\n\nQantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said that today represents another important step forward as the airline works towards restoring public confidence in the national carrier, adding that Qantas recognizes it had fallen short of its own standards and let down customers.\n\n\"We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry. The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.\"\n\nOn the latter point, Qantas has updated its processes and is investing in new technology across the Group to ensure this issue is not repeated. Hudson thanked the ACCC for its cooperation, which she said enables the airline to compensate customers much sooner than if the case had dragged on through the court.\n\nRelated A Qantas Airbus A380 Is Making One Of The Longest Ever Flights Back To Australia After emerging from the desert in 2021 and undergoing heavy maintenance in Germany, Qantas A380 VH-OQK flew 10,000 miles nonstop on December 16.\n\nWe'd love to see you on Instagram - follow us here !\n\nA logical way out of court\n\nThe ACCC alleged Qantas had engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by advertising tickets for more than 8,000 flights that it had already canceled but not removed from sale. These serious charges carry maximum penalties for each breach of up to AU$10 million ($6.6m), three times the total benefits obtained or 10% of the corporation's turnover, whichever is greater. With that hanging over the airline's head, it is not difficult to see why a settlement was the logical way out of this mess.\n\nPhoto: Ryan Fletcher | Shutterstock\n\nUnder the settlement agreed with the ACCC, more than 86,000 customers who made a booking on a flight two or more days after the cancellation decision was made will be compensated. Those impacted customers will receive AU$225 ($149) for domestic/trans-Tasman flights and AU$450 ($297) for international flights, on top of any refund or alternative flight already offered to these customers.\n\nOf the customers affected, 94% were booked on domestic or trans-Tasman flights, and 80% of those on domestic flights were offered an alternative flight departing prior to or within three hours of the scheduled departure time. More than 60% of affected international customers were offered an alternative flight prior to or within 12 hours of the scheduled departure time.\n\nPhoto: Vincenzo Pace | Simple Flying\n\nQantas said compensation payments will be available through a dedicated online portal facilitated by Deloitte and will be independently audited. Next month, the airline will email impacted customers with details about how they can lodge a claim, and more information is available at www.qantasremediation.deloitte.com.au.\n\nThe ACCC is no longer proceeding with its claims that Qantas wrongfully accepted payment, including the allegation that the airline had received payment for a service it did not, and had no intention of, providing.\n\nWhat do you think of this outcome?

US$66m penalty in flight cancellation case", "body": "CANBERRA, May 6 -- Australian airline Qantas Airways said today it had agreed to pay a penalty of A$100 million (US$66 million) to settle a lawsuit that accused it of illegally selling thousands of tickets for flights that had already been cancelled.\n\nThe penalty is subject to the approval of the Federal Court of Australia, it said in a statement.\n\nAs part of the settlement with Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Qantas will start an additional A$20 million remediation programme for passengers affected by the cancellations, with each impacted customer receiving payments of between A$225 and A$450, the airline said.\n\n\"We are pleased to have secured these admissions by Qantas that it misled its customers, and its agreement that a very significant penalty is required as a result of this conduct,\" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement. \"The size of this proposed penalty is an important milestone in enforcing the Australian Consumer Law.\"\n\nQantas was sued last August by the ACCC, which had alleged that in some cases, the airline's flights were on sale for several weeks after cancellation.\n\n\"When flying resumed after the Covid shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards,' Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson said.\n\n\"We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry.\"\n\nHudson said the airline had upgraded processes and was investing in new technology to avoid a repeat of the situation.\n\nQantas said the financial impact of the remediation program and penalty would be included as an expense in the group's full-year results for the financial year ending June 30 as an item outside the airline's key profit measure, underlying profit before tax.\n\nThe actual cash outflow for the remediation and penalty is expected to occur in the following financial year, the airline added. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

tickets on already cancelled flights between May and July 2022.\n\nBut today Qantas came clean, admitting its misconduct actually continued until August 2023, when the ACCC first commenced its investigation.\n\nQantas has agreed to hand over $20 million in compensation to affected passengers.\n\nThe figure is set to be broken down to $225 for domestic ticket holders and $450 for international flights, on top of the refund travellers should already have received.\n\nREAD MORE: New Queensland policing powers pave the way for national knife crime overhaul\n\nThe national carrier

was occurring at a time when we were under significant pressure after the restart from Covid.\"\n\nThe phantom flight investigation is the latest scandal to test Qantas' consumer trust, which has

of Hudson following Alan Joyce's retirement as CEO, advertising expert Dee Madigan says Qantas' reboot needs a reboot.\n\n\"What Qantas should have done is draw a line under Alan Joyce, got rid of the court cases to show that they've learnt what they've done wrong,\" Madigan said.\n\n\"Instead they sort of just keep digging in [and] what it does is just make people feel worse about the

The airline also said it was scared that telling customers about mass flight cancellations would overwhelm its call centres.\n\nAs part of the settlement agreement, Qantas has now pledged $20 million as part of a remediation programme which will pay impacted customers between $225 to $450.\n\nIn addition, Qantas has agreed to pay a $100 million civil penalty - subject to the approval of the Federal Court of Australia.\n\nThe compensation package will apply to any customer who booked a ticket on a flight two or more days after the service had been earmarked for cancellation. Around 86,000 passengers receive compensation, with domestic and trans-Tasman flight passengers receiving $225 and international passengers receiving $450 in compensation.\n\nThe vast majority of affected passengers (around 94%) were booked on domestic and trans-Tasman flights. Qantas maintains, however, that 80% of domestic passengers were offered an alternative flight within 3 hours of the original departure time.\n\n\"Today represents another important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier,\" commented Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson on Monday.\n\nThe scandal propelled Hudson to the top spot after disgraced former chief executive Alan Joyce decided to step down with immediate effect rather than wait for a later retirement date.\n\n\"When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards,\" Hudson continued. \"We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry.\"\n\n\"The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.\"\n\nHudson says the airline has since updated its systems and processes to ensure a similar situation can't occur in the future.", "source": {"uri": "paddleyourownkanoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddle Your Own Kanoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mateusz_maszczynski@paddleyourownkanoo.com", "name": "Mateusz Maszczynski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Tasman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans-Tasman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Hudson_(executive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Hudson (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Joyce_(executive)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Joyce (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shutterstock_2336681675-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The possible harm to the airline's reputation and customer base was reflected in the sharp tumble of 1.2% in the share price of the airline on Wednesday, CNBC reported.\n\n\"At this stage, there is no indication of a cyber security incident,\" the airline said in a statement to ABC.net.au. \"We sincerely apologize to customers impacted by the issue with the Qantas app Wednesday morning, which has now been resolved.\"\n\n\"No further personal or financial information was shared and customers would not have been able to transfer or use the Qantas Points of other frequent flyers,\" they said.\n\nQantas flyer Josh Withers from Hobart experienced the app glitch firsthand. He opened the app and saw the data of another person instead of his own, including their name and boarding ticket. This occurrence, which revealed private passenger information and raised worries about traveler privacy, demonstrates the true significance of the issue, according to ABC.net.au.\n\nThe airline assured customers even though they could see other users' information, they couldn't abuse it. There were no reports of Qantas points being lost or mistaken boarding as a result of the problem. The airline advised customers to just log out and back into their accounts as a temporary workaround, per CNBC.\n\nThe incident comes after some Spanish airline Air Europa experienced compromised customers' credit card information die to an unprecedented data breach. They notify banks and those harmed, but it is unclear how many people were impacted and how much money was lost. Air Europa said there hasn't been any fraud yet, but they advise canceling cards. A consumer advocacy organization raises concerns about the delay, pointing to a larger problem and the possibility of past fraud.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shreyashi_chakraborty@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "Shreyashi Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hobart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hobart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Europa", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Europa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Login", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Login"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Customs", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Customs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1840811/qantas-begins-preparing-equipping-planes-return-international-flights-sydney.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

This decision comes in the wake of severe accusations against the airline for handling what has been dubbed the \"ghost flights\" scandal.\n\nImpact on Consumers\n\nAccording to Gulf News, the scandal involved Qantas marketing tens of thousands of flights without informing customers that these flights had been canceled. This practice led to significant inconvenience for travelers, many of whom had made extensive holiday, business, and personal travel plans.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has addressed these issues, highlighting the extent of the airline's misleading conduct. The ACCC's chairperson, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, described Qantas' actions as \"egregious and unacceptable.\"\n\nQantas' Response\n\nYahoo reported that in addition to the hefty fine, Qantas has committed to compensating the affected customers. It plans to distribute $13 million among 86,000 travelers for the inconvenience and disruption.\n\nVanessa Hudson, Qantas' chief executive, has publicly admitted the airline's shortcomings, stating that the company has fallen short of its standards and sincerely apologizes for disappointing its customers.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Qantas\n\nWith the $66 million fine pending court approval, Qantas, a century-old carrier often celebrated as the \"Spirit of Australia,\" faces the arduous task of mending its reputation.\n\nThis challenge comes amid a wider consumer backlash over increased ticket prices, allegations of substandard service, and controversial labor practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite defending its ticketing practices by suggesting that customers purchase a \"bundle of rights\" rather than seats on specific flights, Qantas now focuses on restoring trust and ensuring passenger satisfaction.\n\nLast year, Qantas reported an annual profit of $1.1 billion, showcasing a significant financial recovery post-pandemic. However, with the early retirement of its veteran chief executive Alan Joyce, following intense scrutiny, the airline remains under pressure to rebuild its image and prioritize consumer interests in the competitive aviation market.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Hudson_(executive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Hudson (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Joyce_(executive)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Joyce (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/05/owoaje4lmu_th_1024x0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The agreement, valued at A$120 million ($79 million), arises from allegations surrounding the sale of tickets for flights that had already been cancelled, colloquially termed as \"ghost flights.\" The move is seen as a concerted effort by Qantas to address a reputational crisis that has beset the airline in recent times.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, Qantas will allocate A$20 million to compensate over 86,000 affected customers who had booked tickets for these non-operational flights. Additionally, the airline will pay a hefty A$100 million fine, thus opting to resolve the lawsuit rather than engage in protracted legal proceedings.\n\nCEO Vanessa Hudson acknowledged the company's shortcomings, stating, \"We recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards.\" She underlined the expediency of the settlement in facilitating compensation for affected passengers.\n\nThe proposed settlement, subject to court approval, would bring closure to a contentious issue that has adversely impacted Qantas' brand perception, prompting the early departure of former CEO Alan Joyce. ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb underscored the significance of the imposed penalty as a deterrent to other companies.\n\nDespite the substantial payout, analysts view this development positively, with Qantas shares trading marginally higher. RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell sees the resolution as a step towards mitigating post-COVID challenges and improving the company's valuation.\n\nWhile this settlement addresses one legal battle, Qantas still faces uncertainties regarding the compensation for ground handling staff terminated in 2020, a matter pending court determination.\n\nThe dispute between Qantas and the ACCC stemmed from operational difficulties following the reopening of Australia's borders post-COVID restrictions. The airline contended that it encountered similar challenges as its counterparts globally, yet the ACCC asserted that Qantas' actions contravened consumer law, including the sale of tickets for cancelled flights.\n\nThe settlement includes a commitment from Qantas to refrain from repeating the contentious conduct, marking a pivotal agreement in the aviation sector.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Hudson_(executive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Hudson (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Joyce_(executive)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Joyce (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_ground_handling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft ground handling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/Screenshot2024-02-12at4.40.56PM-170773631938316_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Qantas lied to customers about flights it would never operate, then lied about why it did it.\n\nToday's ACCC statement, released before the sharemarket opened, states:\n\nQantas has admitted that it misled consumers by advertising tickets for tens of thousands of flights it had already decided to cancel, and by cancelling thousands more flights without promptly telling ticketholders of its decision.\"\n\nNote the ACCC's use of \"misled\". The conduct was \"egregious and unacceptable\", according to the ACCC. \"Many consumers will have made holiday, business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled.\"\n\nThe airline will be forced to pay $20 million to customers in compensation and pay another $100 million in fines for its misconduct if the Federal Court agrees.\n\nThe conduct took place between May 2021 and August 2023, when the ACCC hit the airline with its charges of misleading consumers, and occurred on the watch of the now discredited and departed CEO Alan Joyce. On Joyce's watch, Qantas was found to have illegally sacked 1,700 workers, was fined $250,000 for standing down a health and safety representative who directed staff not to clean unsafe planes (and then lied about its actions), became Australia's most complained-about company and a by-word for appalling service amid mass cancellations and lost luggage, was accused of slot hoarding to block competitors, and tried to rip off customers with COVID-era flight credits by shutting down access to unused credits.\n\nIncredibly, despite being forced to admit to misleading and deceptive conduct to the ACCC, Qantas today refused to admit it misled customers, and is still trying to blame the pandemic. \"When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards,\" CEO Vanessa Hudson (and former chief financial officer when the misconduct occurred) said this morning. Nowhere does the statement mention that the company has admitted to misleading customers.\n\nThe airline's ridiculous \"FAQ\", launched when it tried to defend its conduct last year, asserted the ACCC didn't understand the airline industry and that Qantas couldn't tell customers it cancelled their flights because \"if we had sent texts to thousands of customers a week saying their flight had been cancelled and we would get back to them on their alternative flight options, we would have created a lot of needless uncertainty for those customers and even longer call centre wait times.\"\n\nNow it admits \"we know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry.\"\n\nThere was no word in the Qantas statement about the fate of an extra $2.2 million bonus for Joyce, withheld last year \"until there was more information about the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's claim against the company,\" according to reports in September.\n\nThe airline's refusal to admit that it misled customers -- the words \"misled\" and \"misconduct\" are used over and over in today's ACCC statement -- shows that the spirit of Joyce lives on in the so-called new era. Qantas lied, lied about its lies, and is continuing by omission to pretend it was all about the pandemic and its overloaded systems.\n\nThe lying never stops at the flying kangaroo.\n\nAre you buying Qantas' excuses?

After the ACCC filed its lawsuit last August, Hudson's longserving predecessor, Alan Joyce, brought forward his retirement.\n\n\"This penalty ... will send a strong deterrence message to other companies,\" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\nThe payout, however, would pale against the A$1.47 billion net profit that analysts on average forecast Qantas to report in the year to end-June, according to LSEG data. People who bought tickets on non-existent domestic flights would get A$225 and people with international fares would get A$450, on top of a refund, the airline and regulator said.\n\nQantas shares were flat in late trading, against a 0.6% gain in the broader Australian market.\n\n\"We see today's outcome as incremental positive, removing another post-COVID brand and valuation overhang from the stock,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell said in a client note.\n\nQantas is still waiting to learn how much it must pay nearly 1,700 ground handling staff it sacked in 2020 after a court found the job cuts were illegal since they were intended to stop industrial action.\n\nThe ACCC lawsuit centred on the months after Australia's border reopened in 2022 following two years of COVID restrictions, and airline cancellations and lost luggage complaints spiked globally amid staffing shortages.\n\nQantas had argued that it faced similar challenges to airlines around the world, but the ACCC said its actions broke consumer law. It had said the airline sometimes sold tickets to flights weeks after they were cancelled.\n\nThe ACCC's Cass-Gottlieb noted that the settlement included a promise from Qantas not to repeat the conduct.\n\n($1 = 1.5124 Australian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye in Sydney and Poonam Behura in Bengaluru; Editing by Jamie Freed)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Cass-Gottlieb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gina Cass-Gottlieb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Joyce_(executive)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Joyce (executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_ground_handling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft ground handling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b84198b/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fd5%2F1ae547b47c8975a84d9651160885d6%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK4409Z%3A12024-05-05T221901Z_1_LYNXMPEK4409Z_RTROPTP_3_QANTAS-CYBER.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

It has agreed reached a settlement to pay a hefty penalty of $66 million on Monday, following the contentious scandal, where the airlines was accused of selling seats continuously on flights long after they had been canceled. According to reports, the settlement also includes an additional $13 million set aside for providing as compensation to the 86,000 costumers who had been affected by the cancellations and subsequent rescheduling of the flights.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) revealed that Qantas had reportedly admitted to have deceived its customers. The commission stated that the airlines \"admitted that it misled consumers\" by advertising seats on tens of thousands of flights, despite the fact that these flights had been canceled long ago. ACCC chairperson Gina Cass-Gottlieb condemned Qantas' actions as \"egregious and unacceptable,\" highlighting the grave impact that the deception had on consumers who had made their travel plans based on bookings for flights that no longer existed.\n\nQantas CEO Vanessa Hudson expressed regret over the airline's shortcomings, acknowledging that the company had failed to meet its own standards and had disappointed its customers. Hudson, while addressing the company's failure, pressed that many customers of the airlines had been gravely affected by the lack of timely notification about the cancellation of their flights.

The airline faced criticism over steep ticket prices, allegations of subpar service quality, and the dismissal of 1,700 ground staff during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile Qantas had previously defended its practice of selling seats on canceled flights, arguing that customers purchase a \"bundle of rights\" rather than specific seats, the settlement underscores the importance of transparent and ethical business practices in the airline industry.\n\nDespite the turbulence caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Qantas managed to post a substantial annual profit of $1.1 billion last year, signaling a remarkable financial recovery.

The fine is the biggest ever for an Australian airline and among the largest globally in the sector, although some Australian banks and casino operators have faced higher penalties for breaches of the law.\n\nAustralia's Qantas Airways agreed to pay A$120 million ($79 million) to settle a regulator lawsuit over the sale of thousands of tickets on already cancelled flights, in an attempt to end a reputational crisis that has engulfed the airline.

The ACCC lawsuit centred on the months after Australia's border reopened in 2022 following two years of COVID restrictions, and airline cancellations and lost luggage complaints spiked globally amid staffing shortages.\n\nQantas had argued that it faced similar challenges to airlines around the world, but the ACCC said its actions broke consumer law. It had said the airline sometimes sold tickets to flights weeks after they were cancelled.

The consumer watchdog accused the airline of selling thousands of tickets for domestic and international flights that had already been cancelled.\n\nToday, both parties reached a settlement, avoiding a drawn out battle in court. The airline will pay A$20 million in compensation to 86,000 passengers who bought tickets on 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled. It will also pay a $100 million civil penalty.\n\nIt's important to note this settlement is not yet finalised - it must first be approved by the Federal Court of Australia. The court will look at whether this amount is an appropriate penalty for the airline, and whether the compensation set to be paid is fair and reasonable.\n\nIn most cases, the court is willing to accept a settlement between a powerful regulator like the ACCC and a cooperating corporation. However, these final penalties are not guaranteed. In 2018, a $36 million settlement between Westpac and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) was thrown out because the court felt it was too low.\n\nQantas has historically been one of Australia's most trusted brands. But in recent years, it has lost 7% of its brand value and fallen in global brand rankings. The decision to agree to this settlement goes to the heart of rebuilding trust and protecting consumers from further misleading conduct.\n\nRead more: Even if Qantas is fined hundreds of millions it is likely to continue to take us for granted\n\nThe airline admits to a lesser charge\n\nThe ACCC has a range of tools for tackling corporate misconduct. The ACCC Act - which underpins the regulator's powers - aims to provide meaningful national consumer protection laws and coordinate the watchdog's enforcement actions.\n\nSome parts of this act cover what are known as civil breaches. These allow the regulator to impose major financial penalties, but not imprisonment. Other parts cover criminal breaches, and contain provisions to impose up to two-years imprisonment and fines of up to $50 million.\n\nSelling tickets for flights that have already been cancelled is in clear breach of Section 18 of Australian Consumer Law for misleading and deceptive conduct. In 2019, this same section of the act was used to issue Volkswagen with a $125 million fine for misleading consumers on its vehicles' emissions.\n\nBut this section is purely civil, which means a corporation or individual in question can only be forced to pay damages or compensation. The amount of compensation that can be ordered by the regulator is unlimited in dollar value, but restricted by the costs or damage incurred by the consumer.\n\nThis costs and damages approach is how Qantas' $20 million compensation figure was calculated - $225 per ticket for domestic flights and $450 per international ticket. It's important to note this compensation has to be paid on top of any new tickets or other compensation Qantas may have already supplied to affected customers.\n\nBut when it first filed the lawsuit, the ACCC accused Qantas of taking payments for goods or services it did not intend to provide. This is a far more serious criminal allegation that falls under Section 36 of Australian Consumer Law. Criminal cases are tried before a jury and require proof beyond reasonable doubt. Charges are much harder to prove than those in a civil case or even a civil penalty case, which is heard by a single judge and proven on the balance of probability.\n\nThe regulator agreed to drop this much harsher line of attack on the airline in exchange for the settlement. Still, ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb didn't mince words when announcing the settlement, labelling Qantas' behaviour \"egregious and unacceptable\".\n\nIn a media release, Cass-Gottlieb put the wider Australian business community on notice, saying she hoped today's settlement would send:\n\nan important message to companies across the economy that breaches of the Australian Consumer Law are serious and will result in material fines.\n\nWhy settle now and what happens next?\n\nQantas and the ACCC both understand that if this matter had been dragged into court proceedings, ticket holders may not have been compensated for a number of years. It could have also risked further reputational damage for Qantas. By agreeing to settle for the lesser charge - misleading conduct - the affected customers will be paid sooner.\n\nThe proposed remediation scheme will be handled independently by professional services firm Deloitte. But the Federal Court is unlikely to formally agree to the settlement before 1 July. Conveniently for Qantas, this will enable the airline to record the settlement as an expense in the current financial year but make the actual payments in the next one.\n\nThis settlement - if accepted by the Court - could help to rebuild Qantas' reputation. But it will also serve as a powerful deterrent, signalling to the business community that misleading consumers will not be tolerated.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities and Investments Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_England_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of New England (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westpac", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westpac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Consumer_Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Consumer Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Cass-Gottlieb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gina Cass-Gottlieb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/592294/original/file-20240506-16-k0tp2p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C80%2C5595%2C2793&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 4711, "textEnd": 4717}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The airline will pay A$20 million in compensation to 86,000 passengers who bought tickets on 8,000 flights that had already been cancelled. It will also pay a $100 million civil penalty.\n\nIt's important to note this settlement is not yet finalised - it must first be approved by the Federal Court of Australia. The court will look at whether this amount is an appropriate penalty for the airline, and whether the compensation set to be paid is fair and reasonable.\n\nIn most cases, the court is willing to accept a settlement between a powerful regulator like the ACCC and a cooperating corporation. However, these final penalties are not guaranteed.

It's important to note this compensation has to be paid on top of any new tickets or other compensation Qantas may have already supplied to affected customers.\n\nBut when it first filed the lawsuit, the ACCC accused Qantas of taking payments for goods or services it did not intend to provide. This is a far more serious criminal allegation that falls under Section 36 of Australian Consumer Law. Criminal cases are tried before a jury and require proof beyond reasonable doubt. Charges are much harder to prove than those in a civil case or even a civil penalty case, which is heard by a single judge and proven on the balance of probability.\n\nThe regulator agreed to drop this much harsher line of attack on the airline in exchange for the settlement. Still, ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb didn't mince words when announcing the settlement, labelling Qantas' behaviour \"egregious and unacceptable\".\n\nIn a media release, Cass-Gottlieb put the wider Australian business community on notice, saying she hoped today's settlement would send:\n\nan important message to companies across the economy that breaches of the Australian Consumer Law are serious and will result in material fines.\n\nQantas and the ACCC both understand that if this matter had been dragged into court proceedings, ticket holders may not have been compensated for a number of years. It could have also risked further reputational damage for Qantas. By agreeing to settle for the lesser charge - misleading conduct - the affected customers will be paid sooner.\n\nThe proposed remediation scheme will be handled independently by professional services firm Deloitte. But the Federal Court is unlikely to formally agree to the settlement before 1 July. Conveniently for Qantas, this will enable the airline to record the settlement as an expense in the current financial year but make the actual payments in the next one.\n\nThis settlement - if accepted by the Court - could help to rebuild Qantas' reputation. But it will also serve as a powerful deterrent, signalling to the business community that misleading consumers will not be tolerated.", "source": {"uri": "canadianinquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philippine Canadian Inquirer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qantas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qantas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Securities and Investments Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Consumer_Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Consumer Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westpac", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westpac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Cass-Gottlieb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gina Cass-Gottlieb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://canadianinquirer.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/4352083900_c02d39b258_c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541436", "eventUri": "eng-9541436", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 4448, "textEnd": 4454}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Closing remarks are scheduled for 20 May.\n\nTWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said:\n\n\"This is good news for passengers misled by the appalling conduct of Qantas. Customers have suffered multiple times from being ripped off, dealing with flight cancellations, delays and lost baggage and even being blamed for airport chaos by Alan Joyce.\n\n\"Spare a thought for the 1700 Qantas families who weren't just misled, but were illegally sacked, and are still waiting for justice more than three years later. Qantas dragged them through costly, unsuccessful appeals taking every legal point in the book through an army of expensive silks. In December, Qantas walked away from mediation to reach a settlement for the unlawfully axed workers. It's another stark reminder of Joyce-led Qantas' disdain for its own workforce.\n\n\"Justice delayed is justice denied. Illegally sacked workers need closure and compensation for some of the hardest years of their lives. Family breakdowns, houses lost, mental and physical health suffering. Qantas has a lot to answer for, and it must pay.\n\n\"The last few years have shone a spotlight on the awful, immoral business model at Qantas and the dire consequences for passengers, workers and taxpayers from an absence of regulation.\n\n\"Qantas is being held to account through a high court ruling on 1700 illegal sackings, a criminal conviction for discrimination under the Work Health and Safety Act, and a $120 million settlement with the ACCC. But hardworking people should not have to wait for bad actors to be penalised to hope that things will change.

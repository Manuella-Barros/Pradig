County. Voters approved that tax in 2017, and it's not scheduled to expire until 2027.\n\nBut those who want to replace the quarter-cent sales tax with a permanent half-cent tax say the proposed new measure not only would expand programs that tackle root causes of homelessness but focus on keeping people from losing their homes in the first place - something they say wasn't part of past efforts to combat homelessness.\n\nLast month, a coalition of housing affordability and mental health experts, service providers and others submitted more than 410,000 signatures to the county registrar's office. To qualify for the Nov. 5 ballot, organizers needed to collect 238,922 valid signatures.\n\n\"It's inspiring to see hundreds of thousands of L.A. County residents stepping up and affirming that we need bolder action to make housing more affordable and increased accountability that is tied to clear results. I'm deeply thankful to the thousands of volunteers who helped power forward this qualification effort,\" Elise Buik, president and CEO of United Way of Greater L.A., said in a statement.\n\nThe proposed measure would focus on making housing more affordable and increasing mental health and substance abuse treatment. To promote accountability, service providers who receive funding would be required to meet performance goals, report how they spend their money and undergo annual audits.\n\nLast month, the head of the Los Angeles County Business Federation, commonly known as BizFed, raised concerns about the proposal, saying that while business leaders are committed to supporting efforts to combat homelessness, with three years left on the Measure H tax, this proposal is \"rushed\" and would result in a \"forever tax.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailybreeze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Breeze"}, "authors": [{"uri": "linh_tat@dailybreeze.com", "name": "Linh Tat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Way_Worldwide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Way Worldwide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.dailybreeze.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/LDN-L-BALLOT-INITIATIVE-0508-DC-3.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669469", "eventUri": "eng-9669469", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 216, "textEnd": 223}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1030, "textEnd": 1036}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

County registrar on Thursday confirmed that the measure qualified for the November ballot. The office reported that proponents submitted more than 410,000 signatures in May, but just 238,922 valid signatures were required to qualify.\n\nThe backstory: You might remember voters passed quarter cent tax in 2017 -- known as Measure H. That's due to end in 2027.\n\nHow much money are we talking about? Supporters of the half-cent sales tax say it would generate about $1.2 billion in funding each year. Now that it's qualified for the ballot, the fiscal impacts will be studied by the state legislative analyst office and that report will be available to voters.\n\nWhat's next: The campaign over this measure could be contentious. Opponents say the initial Measure H tax has failed to do what was promised -- with homelessness up nearly 40% in the county. Advocates of this new initiative, known as the \"Affordable Housing, Homelessness Solutions and Prevention Now,\" say there's a key difference with the new initiative: a focus on preventing people from ending up on the streets in the first place.\n\nKeep in mind: California law requires any tax measures that generate revenue to pass by at least a two-thirds vote.\n\nGo deeper: David Wagner, who covers housing for LAist, wrote more about this proposed measure when the signatures were presented to the L.A.

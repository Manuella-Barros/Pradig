He served as the revered, historically Black institution\u2019s commencement speaker the same year that it bestowed an honorary doctorate upon the three-time Grammy winner. Two years after that, in 2016, Combs revealed he had donated $1m to Howard so that the university could create a scholarship fund for undergraduate business students in need of financial aid, which included internships and mentoring opportunities for his business and entertainment conglomerate, as the local news station Fox 5 DC reported. But that same the year, the music producer and businessman manhandled and kicked Ventura \u2013 his girlfriend at the time \u2013 in view of surveillance cameras at a hotel in the Century City neighborhood of Los Angeles. Ventura sued Combs for damages in November, accusing him rape and severe physical abuse during the course of a relationship that started in 2007 \u2013 when she was 19 and he was 37 \u2013 and lasted on and off until 2018. Combs \u2013 whose other onstage monikers have included Puff Daddy and Love \u2013 paid undisclosed terms to settle Ventura\u2019s lawsuit one day after she filed it. But the unusually rapid settlement did not head off at least six more lawsuits which have been filed and accuse him of sexual assaults as well as other instances of physical violence. Meanwhile, in March, federal authorities raided Combs\u2019 properties in Los Angeles and Miami as part of a sex-trafficking investigation. Combs\u2019 legal peril then intensified as it perhaps never had before in mid-May when CNN obtained and released the video of him battering Ventura \u2013 footage that he had paid $50,000 to buy from the hotel and presumably suppress, according to her settled lawsuit. The video contradicted Combs\u2019 denials of the allegations from Ventura and his other accusers, and it undermined his pledge to \u201cfight for [his] name\u201d. Within two days, Combs released a video apology, declaring that he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d with himself and \u201ctruly sorry\u201d, and had no excuses beyond pointing out that those were his \u201cdarkest times\u201d. That chain of events prompted Howard\u2019s governing board to take steps disaffiliating the university from Combs when the panel\u2019s members gathered for a regularly scheduled meeting on Friday. In addition to rescinding his honorary degree, canceling the scholarship program named after him and giving back the donation that funded it, the university decided to end a separate 2023 pledge agreement with Combs under which no money had actually been received yet. The governing board\u2019s statement said it also \u201cdirected that his name be removed from all documents listing honorary degree recipients of Howard University\u201d. Howard\u2019s actions on Friday came a little more than two weeks after Ventura issued her only statement on the video showing Combs abusing her. \u201cMy only ask is that everyone open your heart to believing victims the first time,\u201d the singer\u2019s statement said.", "summary": "<p>Move comes after video released showing hip-hop mogul attacking singer Cassie Ventura in 2016</p><p>Howard University on Friday announced that it has revoked the honorary degree it gave to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/diddy\">Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs</a> in 2014, discontinued a scholarship program named after the rap mogul and returned a $1m donation from him, citing the video which showed him violently attacking singer Cassie Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel.</p><p>\u201cMr Combs\u2019 behavior \u2026 is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard University\u2019s core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institution\u2019s highest honor,\u201d the Washington DC school said in <a href=\"https://thedig.howard.edu/all-stories/howard-university-board-trustees-votes-accept-return-honorary-degree-issued-sean-combs-end?utm_source=thedig&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=boardtrustees\">a statement</a>. \u201cThe university is unwavering in its opposition to all acts of interpersonal violence.\u201d</p", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jun/08/howard-university-revokes-sean-combs-honorary-degree-scholarship", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ddf4e7b3940d414cb46c7034d000bfd32ade78a/0_22_4905_2943/master/4905.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:30:20", "author": "Ramon Antonio Vargas", "authors": ["Ramon Antonio Vargas"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.017}

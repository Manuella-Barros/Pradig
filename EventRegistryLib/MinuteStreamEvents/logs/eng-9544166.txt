The reliever runway reopened around 12:10 p.m., allowing flights to land or take off until the main runway reopened just after 3 p.m., she said.\n\nTwo planes heading to the airport at the time of the pause were diverted to Charleston but had since touched down in Savannah, Lynah said. No other flights were affected.\n\nThe public affairs office at the Air National Guard 16th Airlift Wing, which operates out of the Savannah airport, said an F-22 Raptor fighter jet \"was involved in an aircraft mishap\" on the main runway. Personnel were investigating the incident as of Monday afternoon.\n\nThe 43,000-pound stealth fighter was taking to the skies for Sentry Savannah 2024, a yearly training event for National Guard Bureau warfighters across the southeast.

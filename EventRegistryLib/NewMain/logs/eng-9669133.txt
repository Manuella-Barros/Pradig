Enjoy delicious food and beverage options onboard, with wide, reclining seats, ample legroom, and electrical outlets for convenience. Prepare ahead by arriving at Penn Station early, ensuring you have your physical boarding pass, and enjoying the beautiful route through upstate New York.\n\nBefore air travel and taxis, trains were the world's mode of transportation, and for good reason! Not only are trains an efficient and affordable means of transport to get from one coast to the other, but it's the ideal way to see the most while also indulging in a unique experience (which often also includes dinner and a cocktail!), and avoiding traffic and airport hassle. It's a win-win!\n\nWith nearly 21,000 route miles in 46 states and three Canadian provinces, Amtrak is a popular rail service that allows adventurers to travel and explore in a new and exciting way, especially to corners of the U.S. like the eternally beautiful and ravishing region of the Northeast. From coastal views to mountain vistas, traveling by Amtrak not only delivers one-of-a-kind scenic journeys that are perfect for summer adventures but also offers travelers the opportunity to see the world through a different lens.\n\nOne particularly special Amtrak route is NYC to Montreal, which is taken by the Adirondack train. The route begins in bustling New York City and takes you all the way to the wondrous city of Montreal, which is in the province of Quebec, Canada. Amtrak is also a fantastic way to enjoy the winter, and you can create the ultimate magical winter experience on Amtrak, too.\n\nAlthough you can choose to fly from NYC to Montreal, many avid travelers purposely choose to travel by Amtrak because, when traveling by train, the experience of the adventure and all the wonderful things that come with it is more about the journey, rather than just the destination.\n\nRelated Amtrak's Newest Train Brings With It A High-Speed Upgrade One part of the USA faced limitations in rail service, but this new Amtrak train and route is working to solve those issues.\n\nThis Is Why Travelers Are Obsessed With Taking The Amtrak From NYC To Montreal\n\nOf all the ways to travel, taking a train is the new way to adventure, and worth every penny\n\nClose\n\nFirst off, to kick off the fun, travelers begin their Amtrak Adirondack journey at Penn Station before the 12-hour journey to Montreal Central Station (which in itself is an adventure!). Penn Station in itself is a wonder, with it being part of New York culture since it first opened in 1910. Once you've found your way through Penn Station and made it onto your train, you're ready for an epic trip.\n\nEvery passenger that is Canada-bound needs to have a physical boarding pass, not just an e-ticket, in addition to their passport.\n\nFirst things first, once you've found your seat, it's best to prepare for the long and scenic train ride by getting cozy, getting familiar with where the bathrooms are located, and how to order off the menu (yep, there's a food and beverage menu!).\n\nRelated 7 Amtrak Routes That Go From Cities To Mountains Embark on a scenic Amtrak train ride from a bustling city to stunning mountain landscapes. Enjoy a mountain getaway on a popular Amtrak route!\n\nOf course, you can bring your own prepped snacks and drinks to your liking, but it doesn't hurt to enjoy a bowl of White Cheddar Mac and Cheese with a Blueberry Muffin and S. Pellegrino Sparkling Water, especially with their well-priced menu compared to airline food and beverage offerings.\n\nSounds quite heavenly while taking in the majestic beauty of upstate New York through the Hudson Valley, where you'll pass by many beautiful towns on New York's Hudson River, like Yonkers, Poughkeepsie, and Rhinecliff.\n\nPlan ahead and make sure to arrive at Penn Station ahead of time, at least 30 minutes before your train is scheduled to depart, especially if you need help with luggage, bikes, tickets, etc.\n\nAmtrak also offers non-alcoholic beverages in addition to spirits and cocktails, beer and hard seltzer, and wine on its breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\n12-Hour Train Ride - One Way\n\nFood and Beverage Menu Available\n\nPhysical Boarding Pass Is Needed To Ride\n\nPlan Arrival At Penn Station Ahead of Time In Case of Additional Needs For Luggage, Tickets, etc.\n\nThe Magical Route You'll Experience Through New York On Your Way To Canada\n\nYou know what to expect, now let's dive into what you'll experience on this epic adventure\n\nSilver Lake and the Adirondack Mountains from the overlook at the Silver Lake Bog Preserve, Upstate New York\n\nLet's jump back to all the beauty you'll be immersed in when you start your journey on the Amtrak Adirondock train from Penn Station and travel through upstate New York. When traveling in coach, you're looking at an average price of $72 per ticket to ride the train to Montreal, which gets you wide, reclining seats with ample legroom, reading lights, and electric outlets for your convenience. Plus, there are no middle seats, so you won't have to worry about a cramped seating arrangement.\n\nAmtrak is offering modified Adirondack service from May 20 to September 9, 2024. The ticket rates indicated are for dates after that period.\n\nIf you've never considered taking the train, specifically the Amtrak, on an adventure, then why not try something completely new and take

(WALA) - Once a vocal opponent of allowing Amtrak trains to share the railroad with freight trains, the Alabama Port Authority on Tuesday agreed to help pay for passenger rail.\n\nThe port's board voted unanimously to put up $1 million over three years. That's roughly a third of Alabama's share of subsidizing a proposed Amtrak route between Mobile and New Orleans. It's a remarkable turnaround for an agency that previously joined CSX and Norfolk Southern in fighting Amtrak.\n\nIt's also welcome news to Mobile City Councilman William Carroll, who had balked at Mobile picking up the entire tab.\n\n\"That means a lot to me, you know, as a member of the City Council, you know, and hoping to find some kind of way to defray that cost,\" he told FOX10 News.\n\nThere is no timetable on when the City Council might take up the Amtrak subsidy or a still-to-be-finalized ground lease for the train stop next to the Arthur Outlaw Mobile Convention Center. Carroll said he does not know if the plan has the five votes it needs to pass the council but added, \"As far as I'm concerned, I think we're moving in the right direction in order to have passenger rail.\"\n\nUnder the proposal, Amtrak would run two trains a day from Mobile to New Orleans, with stops in Pascagoula, Biloxi, Gulfport and Bay St. Louis in Mississippi. Two trains each day would run in the opposite direction.\n\nAmtrak would operate the trains on behalf of the Southern Rail Commission, a partnership of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. But unlike in the other two states, Alabama has not provided funds, which means the entire state share was going to fall on Mobile taxpayers.\n\nNotwithstanding Tuesday's commitment from the port, at least two council members remain to using city funds.\n\n\"I can't understand or get beyond the fact that the city of Mobile would be on the hook to subsidize this operation when it doesn't exist across the country that I'm aware of where another city is the signer or the one obligated to pay the money,\" Councilman Ben Reynolds said.\n\nAccording to Amtrak, a similar arrangement allowed for train service in Indiana, with local governments paying the cost. But that service no longer operates.\n\nReynolds and Councilman Joel Daves have been strong opponents, particularly since the city's costs likely would rise after federal subsidies go away.\n\nThe Port Authority once was in that camp, as well, for different reasons. It joined CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway in opposing Amtrak service along the Gulf Coast. But they negotiated a settlement before the Surface Transportation Board in 2022.\n\nIf the Amtrak deal goes through, the port stands to benefit from more than $70 million in federal funds for improvements to the rail lines.\n\nThe Port Authority resolution that passed Tuesday references those funds. Amtrak supporters have dangled that investment as reason, alone, to support the Amtrak plan. Reynolds agreed it is a benefit - up to a point.\n\n\"Certainly, it sweetens the pot, especially for the port and the state of Alabama,\" he said. \"And there's no doubt that the city could potentially realize some benefit from that. But to suggest that the city of Mobile is the beneficiary of it, and we should be on the hook in order to get it - locally, our municipality - is, frankly, absurd to me.\"\n\nThere also is the possibility of state funding. The budget for the fiscal year that starts in October already is set, but a spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey reiterated to FOX10 News on Tuesday that the governor continues to \"explore potential options\" for future funding.\n\nDavid Clark, president & CEO of Visit Mobile - and a member of the Southern Rail Commission - welcomed the port's commitment.\n\n\"That's good news,\" he told FOX10 News \"I'm glad the port board did that. ... I can speak from a tourism standpoint, which I think the $3 million from a tourism and infrastructure standpoint is a really good deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox10tv.com", "dataType": "news",

To make matters worse, Amtrak is supposed to raise it's fares at the beginning of July.\n\nThe delays come less than two days after a different transit mess due to overhead Amtrak wire issues.\n\nCommuters have had to deal with delays of up to an hour and a half on Tuesday night, as well as the complete suspension of some lines on Tuesday and Wednesday. These disruptions come ahead of a fare hike set to take effect on July 1.", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amtrak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Station_(New_York_City)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania Station (New York City)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_12_Networks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News 12 Networks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Resumes_and_Portfolios", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Resumes and Portfolios", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/The_Philadelphia_Experiment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/The Philadelphia Experiment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Special Needs", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/f0960fc6a1559a262c539fe130a073aa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669133", "eventUri": "eng-9669133", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1267, "textEnd": 1273}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

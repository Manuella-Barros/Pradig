He was 52.\n\n\"The Dallas Cowboys are very saddened to share that Cowboys legend, Super Bowl Champion, Cowboys Ring of Honor member and Pro Football Hall of Famer Larry Allen passed away suddenly while on vacation in Mexico with his family on Sunday,\" the team said in a press release.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL. His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle - whom he referred to as his heart and soul - his daughters Jayla and Lariana and son, Larry III.\n\n\"The Jones family and the Cowboys extend their deepest condolences, thoughts and prayers to the Allen family and grieve along with the many other friends and Cowboys teammates that also loved Larry.\"\n\nAllen played 14 years in the NFL, 12 with Dallas and his final two for the San Francisco 49ers. A second-round pick out of Sonoma State in 1994, he became a fixture at guard and was a starter for the Super Bowl 30 champs during the 1995 season, the Cowboys' most recent championship.\n\nAllen was an 11-time Pro Bowler and six-time first-team All-Pro who was named to the NFL's All-Decade teams in both the 1990s and 2000s. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013, his first year of eligibility. Allen was also named to the league's all-century team as part of the NFL's celebration of its 100th season in 2019.\n\nKnown for his legendary strength, Allen could bench press 700 pounds - which understandably made him one of the most intimidating players to ever grace the gridiron. Yet the 6-3, 335-pounder was also light on his feet, making him a devastating blocker on sweeps and pulls - and also a guy who might even run down a defender after an interception.\n\nThough he spent the bulk of his career at guard, Allen was also versatile enough to man the left tackle position at an elite level if asked. On a team best known for stars like quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, wide receiver Michael Irvin and cornerback Deion Sanders, Allen had a legitimate case as the Cowboys' best player during his prime.\n\nDetails of Allen's memorial service will be revealed at a future time.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmitt_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmitt Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Aikman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Aikman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Irvin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Irvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/03/USAT/73958133007-usatsi-7364598.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5183,2916,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

that Cowboys legend, Super Bowl Champion, Cowboys Ring of Honor member, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Larry Allen passed away suddenly while on vacation in Mexico with his family on Sunday,\" the

when you look at Allen's resum\u00e9, it's easy to see why he was a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\n(Allen, who also briefly played for the San Francisco 49ers, was enshrined in 2013.)\n\nHe won a ring in Super Bowl XXX as part of the dominant mid-1990s Cowboys teams that were spearheaded by Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin.\n\nAnd while that triumvirate gets the lion's share of the credit for those teams, it can't go understated how critical Allen was in just his sophomore season to that team.\n\nBeyond that championship, he earned All-Pro honors for seven straight seasons between 1995 and 2001.\n\nAllen also had seven Pro Bowl berths in that same period before notching another quartet of Pro Bowl berths between 2003 and 2006.\n\nDue in no small part to those accolades and dominance, the legendary lineman also earned a place on the NFL's 1990s All-Decade Team and the 2000s All-Decade Team.\n\nAllen also was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, solidifying his spot as one of the greatest to ever play the position.\n\n\"His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career,\" the Cowboys said. \"Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul, his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III.\n\n\"The Jones family and the Cowboys extend their deepest condolences, thoughts and prayers to the Allen family and grieve along with the many other friends and Cowboys teammates that also loved Larry.\"", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The team made the announcement on X, giving more details about this legendary player's tragic passing.\n\nRead more: Former Dallas Cowboys All-Pro Running Back Returns to Team\n\nNo additional information about his death was given beyond the post by the Cowboys on X, though the post does state that he died suddenly while on vacation with his family in Mexico on Sunday.\n\n\"The Dallas Cowboys are very saddened to share that Cowboys legend, Super Bowl champion, Cowboys Ring of Honor member, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Larry Allen passed away suddenly while on vacation in Mexico with his family on Sunday,\" the Cowboys write. \"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen in the NFL.\"\n\n\"His versatility and dependability were also signature of his career,\" Dallas notes. \"Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\"\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle - whom he referred to as his as his heart and soul, his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III,\" Dallas writes.\n\n\"The Jones family and the Cowboys extend their deepest condolences, thoughts and prayers to the Allen family and grieve along with many other friends and Cowboys teammates that also loved Larry,\" the missive concludes.\n\nAllen began his career in football playing in high school, though he moved around a lot, attending four different schools in each of his four years of high school. Allen was not academically eligible to play Division I football, so he attended Butte College, where he became a J.C. All-American by his sophomore season.\n\nAllen would take a year off and return to college to play football at Sonoma State University, a Division II program. In his two years playing for the Cossacks, he gave up only one sack, becoming a two-time All-American.\n\nAllen would enter the draft in 1994. His stock fell due to his small stature and a rotator cuff injury. The Cowboys took a chance on him, drafting him in the second round at pick No. 46 overall.\n\nAfter bouncing between guard and tackle in his rookie season, Allen would ultimately start at guard, securing his first of seven Pro Bowl appearances. Allen was instrumental in helping the rushing attack for the Cowboys, aiding Emmitt Smith to secure 1,773 rushing yards and 25 rushing touchdowns.\n\nAllen started in his first Super Bowl in 1996, securing his only ring when the Cowboys took down the Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.\n\nThrough his 14 seasons in the NFL, Allen secured 11 Pro Bowl nods, was a seven-time First Team All-Pro, Super Bowl Champion, NFL 1990s All-Decade Team, NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team, Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor recipient, and Hall of Fame inductee in 2013.\n\nAllen leaves behind an unmatched legacy as an offensive lineman. We offer our condolences to the Allen family and all his friends and colleagues who are mourning his passing.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys_Ring_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmitt_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmitt Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XXX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotator cuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butte College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2403073/cowboys-guard-larry-allen.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=c92d5ef951adcb38c0c4e28c0cffc3c0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

He was 52.\n\n\"The Jones family and the Cowboys extend their deepest condolences, thoughts and prayers to the Allen family and grieve along with the many other friends and Cowboys teammates that also loved Larry,\" the team said.\n\nIn a statement released Monday morning, the Cowboys said Allen was \"known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL.\"\n\nAllen, who played in the NFL for 12 seasons, mostly with the Cowboys, was a member of both the team's Ring of Honor and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\"His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career,\" the Cowboys said. \"Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner,\" the team said in a statement Monday. \"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle - whom he referred to as his heart and soul - his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III.\"\n\nThroughout his legendary NFL career, Allen was an 11-time Pro Bowler and six-time first-team All-Pro. He played in Dallas for 12 years, winning a Super Bowl with the team in 1996, before a brief two-year stay with the San Francisco 49ers in 2006-2007. Allen was signed to a one-day contract before the 2008 season so that he could retire as a member of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nAllen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013. Of his induction, team owner Jerry Jones said he was a fierce player and one of the very best to ever step on the field.\n\n\"Larry is one of the greatest players in Cowboys history, and arguably the very best guard to ever play the game,\" Jones said in a statement in 2013. \"He was obviously a special talent, but the fierceness and tenacity that he brought to the field separated him from the rest of the pack. I have never been more proud of anyone who has reached the Pro Football Hall Fame. Larry Allen represents the best of the very best.\"\n\nAllen was a first-ballot Hall of Famer and a member of both the 1990s and 2000s All-Decade teams.\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\" Pro Football Hall of Fame president Jim Porter said in a statement. \"What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension. In a six-season span, he was named All-Pro every year, and one of those seasons came when the Cowboys needed him to step in at tackle. He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field. Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Janelle; daughters, Jayla and Loriana; and son, Larry III.\"\n\nMemorial service arrangements and details will be announced in the near future.\n\nBy Schuyler Dixon | The Associated Press\n\nThe former Sonoma State lineman was drafted in the second round by the Cowboys in 1994 -- the year before the last of the franchise's five Super Bowl titles -- Allen once bench-pressed 700 pounds while dumbfounded teammates watched, then mobbed him.\n\nAllen was feared enough among his peers that notorious trash-talker John Randle of the Minnesota Vikings decided to keep to himself when he faced the Cowboys, so as to avoid making Allen mad.\n\n\"He never said nothin',\" Nate Newton, one of Allen's mentors on Dallas' offensive line, told The Associated Press for its Hall of Fame story on Allen 11 years ago. \"Every now and then you'd hear him utter a cuss word or hear him laugh that old funny laugh he had.\"\n\nAllen entered the Hall of Fame about a year after his mother died, knowing her presence would have helped him get through a speech after a career spent trying to avoid the spotlight.\n\n\"I miss her,\" Allen said before going into the hall. \"Whenever I'd get nervous or had a big game and got nervous, I'd give her a call, and she'd start making me laugh.\"\n\nThe Cowboys were coming off consecutive Super Bowl wins when they drafted Allen. He was surrounded by Pro Bowl offensive linemen but didn't take long to get noticed, eventually making 11 Pro Bowls himself.\n\nLate in his rookie season, Allen saved a touchdown by running down Darion Conner when it looked like the New Orleans linebacker only had Troy Aikman to beat down the sideline. Most of the rest of his career was defined by power -- first as a tackle, where the Cowboys figured he would be a mainstay, and ultimately as a guard.\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\" the Hall of Fame said in a statement. \"What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension.\"\n\nAllen spent his final two seasons closer to home with the San Francisco 49ers. Then, true to his personality as a player, Allen retired to a quiet life in Northern California with his wife and three kids.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul -- his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III,\" the Cowboys said.\n\nAllen was playing at Butte College when his coach at Sonoma State, Frank Scalercio, discovered him at the junior college where the lineman landed after attending four high schools in the Los Angeles area in part because his mom moved him around to keep him away from gangs.\n\nThen an assistant for Sonoma, Scalercio was recruiting another player when he saw Allen throw an opponent to the ground for the first time.\n\n\"I kinda forgot about the guy I was actually recruiting,\" Scalercio said.\n\nAllen ended up at tiny Sonoma, a Division II school, because his academic progress wasn't fast enough to get him to Division I, where he probably belonged.\n\n\"He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field,\" the Hall of Fame said. \"Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant.\"\n\nIn retirement, Allen showed up at Sonoma basketball games -- the football program was dropped a couple of years after Allen left -- and happily signed autographs and posed for pictures.\n\n\"He's even bigger now than he ever was on campus,\" Tim Burrell, a friend of Allen's, said in 2013. \"Everybody loves him.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news",

He was 52.\n\nAllen died suddenly on Sunday while on vacation with his family in Mexico, the Cowboys said.\n\nA six-time All-Pro who was inducted into the Pro Football of Hall of Fame in 2013, Allen said few words but let his blocking do the talking.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,\" the Cowboys said Monday. \"His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\"\n\nThe former Sonoma State lineman drafted in the second round by the Cowboys in 1994 - the year before the last of the franchise's five Super Bowl titles - Allen once bench-pressed 700 pounds while dumbfounded teammates watched, then mobbed him.\n\nAllen was feared enough among his peers that notorious trash-talker John Randle of the Minnesota Vikings decided to keep to himself when he faced the Cowboys, so as to avoid making Allen mad.\n\nFILE - Dallas Cowboys' Larry Allen takes a knee during NFL training camp, Aug. 1, 2005, in Oxnard, Calif. Allen, one of the most dominant offensive linemen in the NFL during a 12-year career spent mostly with the Dallas Cowboys, died suddenly on Sunday, June 2, 2024, while on vacation with his family in Mexico, the Cowboys said. He was 52. (Irwin Thompson/The Dallas Morning News via AP, File)\n\n\"He never said nothin\u00b4,\" Nate Newton, one of Allen\u00b4s mentors on Dallas\u00b4 offensive line, told The Associated Press for its Hall of Fame story on Allen 11 years ago. \"Every now and then you\u00b4d hear him utter a cuss word or hear him laugh that old funny laugh he had.\"\n\nAllen entered the Hall of Fame about a year after his mother died, knowing her presence would have helped him get through a speech after a career spent trying to avoid the spotlight.\n\n\"I miss her,\" Allen said before going into the hall. \"Whenever I\u00b4d get nervous or had a big game and got nervous, I\u00b4d give her a call, and she\u00b4d start making me laugh.\"\n\nThe Cowboys were coming off consecutive Super Bowl wins when they drafted Allen. He was surrounded by Pro Bowl offensive linemen but didn\u00b4t take long to get noticed, eventually making 11 Pro Bowls himself.\n\nLate in his rookie season, Allen saved a touchdown by running down Darion Conner when it looked like the New Orleans linebacker only had Troy Aikman to beat down the sideline. Most of the rest of his career was defined by power - first as a tackle, where the Cowboys figured he would be a mainstay, and ultimately as a guard.\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\" the Hall of Fame said in a statement. \"What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension.\"\n\nAllen spent his final two seasons closer to home with the San Francisco 49ers. Then, true to his personality as a player, Allen retired to a quiet life in Northern California with his wife and three kids.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle - whom he referred to as his heart and soul - his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III,\" the Cowboys said.\n\nAllen was playing at Butte College when his coach at Sonoma State, Frank Scalercio, discovered him at the junior college where the lineman landed after attending four high schools in the Los Angeles area in part because his mom moved him around to keep him away from gangs.\n\nThen an assistant for Sonoma, Scalercio was recruiting another player when he saw Allen throw an opponent to the ground for the first time.\n\n\"I kinda forgot about the guy I was actually recruiting,\" Scalercio said.\n\nAllen ended up at tiny Sonoma, a Division II school, because his academic progress wasn\u00b4t fast enough to get him to Division I, where he probably belonged.\n\n\"He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field,\" the Hall of Fame said. \"Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant.\"\n\nIn retirement, Allen showed up at Sonoma basketball games - the football program was dropped a couple of years after Allen left - and happily signed autographs and posed for pictures.\n\n\"He\u00b4s even bigger now than he ever was on campus,\" Tim Burrell, a friend of Allen\u00b4s, said in 2013. \"Everybody loves him.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nFILE - Former NFL football player Larry Allen, left, and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones unveil the bust of Allen during the induction ceremony at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Aug. 3, 2013, in Canton, Ohio.

Archer has covered the NFL since 1997 and Dallas since 2003. He joined ESPN in 2010.

His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner,\" the team said in a statement.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul -- his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III. The Jones family and the Cowboys extend their deepest condolences, thoughts and prayers to the Allen family and grieve along with the many other friends and Cowboys teammates that also loved Larry.\"\n\nThe Cowboys said memorial service arrangements will be announced in the near future.\n\nAllen was a second-round pick out of Sonoma State in 1994 and quickly became one of the most dominant offensive linemen in the NFL.\n\nHe was named to the Pro Bowl 11 times and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013. He played for the Cowboys from 1994-2005, winning a Super Bowl in 1995. He spent his final two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nAllen overcame a challenging upbringing in Compton, California. He was once stabbed 12 times while protecting one of his brothers. He attended four different high schools before attending Butte College. He later starred at Sonoma State where the Cowboys found the raw but talented Allen and took him with the 46th pick.\n\nHe protected Cowboys quarterbacks from Troy Aikman to Tony Romo and once shifted from guard to tackle in games. He played right tackle, right guard and left tackle but mostly starred at left guard and was a first-team All-Pro six times.\n\n\"Just received the heartbreaking news of the passing of our beloved teammate Larry Allen. He was a HOF offensive lineman that dominated opponents regardless of the position played. Off the field, he was a gentle giant that loved his family. Rest in Peace LA,\" Aikman posted to X on Monday.\n\nAllen was named to the NFL's top-100 list in 2019, which ranked the top 100 players in league history. He also was named to the All-Decade teams for both the 1990s and 2000s and is just one of three players to be named to both teams, joining Willie Roaf and Warren Sapp, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.\n\nHis feats of strength in the Cowboys' weight room were legendary, once bench-pressing 700 pounds. His speed for his frame astounded many, including chasing down New Orleans Saints linebacker Darion Conner on an interception return in 1994.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darion_Conner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darion Conner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Roaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willie Roaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Aikman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Aikman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butte College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sapp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Sapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Romo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2022%2F0728%2Fr1041568_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

He was 52.\n\nAllen was on vacation with his family in Mexico, the Dallas Cowboys announced in a statement. His cause of death was not revealed.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,\" the Cowboys said.\n\nAllen won Super Bowl XXX with the Cowboys and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013. He was a six-time All-Pro selection and 11-time Pro Bowler in his 14-year career with the Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers.\n\nBut the accolades hardly captured the physical dominance Allen displayed throughout his career on the offensive line, where he was capable of playing any of the four guard and tackle positions.\n\n\"I thought, or least I tried, to get people scared of me,\" said fellow Hall of Fame offensive lineman Jonathan Ogden, who also was elected alongside Allen in 2013. \"This guy scared people all the time. I saw a lot of [defensive linemen] all of a sudden get cramps when they faced Larry.\"\n\nBorn Nov. 27, 1971, in Los Angeles, Allen's path to NFL dominance was far from smooth. Growing up in Compton, Allen was in grade school when he was once stabbed several times trying to protect his older brother. He attended four different high schools and failed to graduate from Butte College.\n\nBut in 1991, an assistant coach at Division II Sonoma State heard about Allen and recruited him to come play football in Northern California. Allen dominated the level for two years, and the Cowboys selected him in the second round of the 1994 NFL Draft.\n\nAllen made a name for himself during his rookie year with his strength and speed.

Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\"\n\nThe former Sonoma State lineman drafted in the second round by the Cowboys in 1994 -- the year before the last of the franchise's five Super Bowl titles -- Allen once bench-pressed 700 pounds while dumbfounded teammates watched, then mobbed him.\n\nAllen was feared enough among his peers that notorious trash-talker John Randle of the Minnesota Vikings decided to keep to himself when he faced the Cowboys, so as to avoid making Allen mad.\n\n\"He never said nothin',\" Nate Newton, one of Allen's mentors on Dallas' offensive line, told The Associated Press for its Hall of Fame story on Allen 11 years ago. \"Every now and then you'd hear him utter a cuss word or hear him laugh that old funny laugh he had.\"\n\nAllen entered the Hall of Fame about a year after his mother died, knowing her presence would have helped him get through a speech after a career spent trying to avoid the spotlight.\n\n\"I miss her,\" Allen said before going into the hall. \"Whenever I'd get nervous or had a big game and got nervous, I'd give her a call, and she'd start making me laugh.\"\n\nThe Cowboys were coming off consecutive Super Bowl wins when they drafted Allen. He was surrounded by Pro Bowl offensive linemen but didn't take long to get noticed, eventually making 11 Pro Bowls himself.\n\nLate in his rookie season, Allen saved a touchdown by running down Darion Conner when it looked like the New Orleans linebacker only had Troy Aikman to beat down the sideline. Most of the rest of his career was defined by power -- first as a tackle, where the Cowboys figured he would be a mainstay, and ultimately as a guard.\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\" the Hall of Fame said in a statement. \"What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension.\"\n\nAllen spent his final two seasons closer to home with the San Francisco 49ers. Then, true to his personality as a player, Allen retired to a quiet life in Northern California with his wife and three kids.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul -- his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III,\" the Cowboys said.\n\nAllen was playing at Butte College when his coach at Sonoma State, Frank Scalercio, discovered him at the junior college where the lineman landed after attending four high schools in the Los Angeles area in part because his mom moved him around to keep him away from gangs.\n\nThen an assistant for Sonoma, Scalercio was recruiting another player when he saw Allen throw an opponent to the ground for the first time.\n\n\"I kinda forgot about the guy I was actually recruiting,\" Scalercio said.\n\nAllen ended up at tiny Sonoma, a Division II school, because his academic progress wasn't fast enough to get him to Division I, where he probably belonged.\n\n\"He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field,\" the Hall of Fame said. \"Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant.\"\n\nIn retirement, Allen showed up at Sonoma basketball games -- the football program was dropped a couple of years after Allen left -- and happily signed autographs and posed for pictures.\n\n\"He's even bigger now than he ever was on campus,\" Tim Burrell, a friend of Allen's, said in 2013. \"Everybody loves him.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri":

Notably, he played in 203 NFL games and was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton (2013).\n\n\"The Jones family and the Cowboys extend their deepest condolences, thoughts and prayers to the Allen family and grieve along with the many other friends and Cowboys teammates that also loved Larry.\"\n\nAllen is survived by his wife Janelle, his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III.", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_santomauro@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Brandon Santomauro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darion_Conner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darion Conner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/IMG_0410-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 1858, "textEnd": 1869}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

He was 52.\n\nAllen died suddenly on Sunday while on vacation with his family in Mexico, the Cowboys said.\n\nA six-time All-Pro who was inducted into the Pro Football of Hall of Fame in 2013, Allen said few words but let his blocking do the talking.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,\" the Cowboys said Monday. \"His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\"\n\nThe former Sonoma State lineman drafted in the second round by the Cowboys in 1994 -- the year before the last of the franchise's five Super Bowl titles -- Allen once bench-pressed 700 pounds while dumbfounded teammates watched, then mobbed him.\n\nAllen was feared enough among his peers that notorious trash-talker John Randle of the Minnesota Vikings decided to keep to himself when he faced the Cowboys, so as to avoid making Allen mad.\n\n\"He never said nothin',\" Nate Newton, one of Allen's mentors on Dallas' offensive line, told The Associated Press for its Hall of Fame story on Allen 11 years ago. \"Every now and then you'd hear him utter a cuss word or hear him laugh that old funny laugh he had.\"\n\nAllen entered the Hall of Fame about a year after his mother died, knowing her presence would have helped him get through a speech after a career spent trying to avoid the spotlight.\n\n\"I miss her,\" Allen said before going into the hall. \"Whenever I'd get nervous or had a big game and got nervous, I'd give her a call, and she'd start making me laugh.\"\n\nThe Cowboys were coming off consecutive Super Bowl wins when they drafted Allen. He was surrounded by Pro Bowl offensive linemen but didn't take long to get noticed, eventually making 11 Pro Bowls himself.\n\nLate in his rookie season, Allen saved a touchdown by running down Darion Conner when it looked like the New Orleans linebacker only had Troy Aikman to beat down the sideline. Most of the rest of his career was defined by power -- first as a tackle, where the Cowboys figured he would be a mainstay, and ultimately as a guard.\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\" the Hall of Fame said in a statement. \"What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension.\"\n\nAllen spent his final two seasons closer to home with the San Francisco 49ers. Then, true to his personality as a player, Allen retired to a quiet life in Northern California with his wife and three kids.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul -- his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III,\" the Cowboys said.\n\nAllen was playing at Butte College when his coach at Sonoma State, Frank Scalercio, discovered him at the junior college where the lineman landed after attending four high schools in the Los Angeles area in part because his mom moved him around to keep him away from gangs.\n\nThen an assistant for Sonoma, Scalercio was recruiting another player when he saw Allen throw an opponent to the ground for the first time.\n\n\"I kinda forgot about the guy I was actually recruiting,\" Scalercio said.\n\nAllen ended up at tiny Sonoma, a Division II school, because his academic progress wasn't fast enough to get him to Division I, where he probably belonged.\n\n\"He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field,\" the Hall of Fame said. \"Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant.\"\n\nIn retirement, Allen showed up at Sonoma basketball games -- the football program was dropped a couple of years after Allen left -- and happily signed autographs and posed for pictures.\n\n\"He's even bigger now than he ever was on campus,\" Tim Burrell, a friend of Allen's, said in 2013. \"Everybody loves him.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news",

He was 52.\n\nAllen died suddenly on Sunday while on vacation with his family in Mexico, the Cowboys said.\n\nA six-time All-Pro who was inducted into the Pro Football of Hall of Fame in 2013, Allen said few words but let his blocking do the talking.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,\" the Cowboys said Monday. \"His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\"\n\nThe former Sonoma State lineman drafted in the second round by the Cowboys in 1994 -- the year before the last of the franchise's five Super Bowl titles -- Allen once bench-pressed 700 pounds while dumbfounded teammates watched, then mobbed him.\n\nAllen was feared enough among his peers that notorious trash-talker John Randle of the Minnesota Vikings decided to keep to himself when he faced the Cowboys, so as to avoid making Allen mad.\n\n\"He never said nothin',\" Nate Newton, one of Allen's mentors on Dallas' offensive line, told The Associated Press for its Hall of Fame story on Allen 11 years ago. \"Every now and then you'd hear him utter a cuss word or hear him laugh that old funny laugh he had.\"\n\nSports\n\nKicker Brandon McManus released by Commanders amid sexual assault allegations Gage Jackson 10:59 AM, Jun 03, 2024\n\nAllen entered the Hall of Fame about a year after his mother died, knowing her presence would have helped him get through a speech after a career spent trying to avoid the spotlight.\n\n\"I miss her,\" Allen said before going into the hall. \"Whenever I'd get nervous or had a big game and got nervous, I'd give her a call, and she'd start making me laugh.\"\n\nThe Cowboys were coming off consecutive Super Bowl wins when they drafted Allen. He was surrounded by Pro Bowl offensive linemen but didn't take long to get noticed, eventually making 11 Pro Bowls himself.\n\nLate in his rookie season, Allen saved a touchdown by running down Darion Conner when it looked like the New Orleans linebacker only had Troy Aikman to beat down the sideline. Most of the rest of his career was defined by power -- first as a tackle, where the Cowboys figured he would be a mainstay, and ultimately as a guard.\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\" the Hall of Fame said in a statement. \"What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension.\"\n\nAllen spent his final two seasons closer to home with the San Francisco 49ers. Then, true to his personality as a player, Allen retired to a quiet life in Northern California with his wife and three kids.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul -- his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III,\" the Cowboys said.\n\nCompany News\n\nNFL launches program to increase partnerships with minority businesses Taylor O'Bier 1:35 PM, May 22, 2024\n\nAllen was playing at Butte College when his coach at Sonoma State, Frank Scalercio, discovered him at the junior college where the lineman landed after attending four high schools in the Los Angeles area in part because his mom moved him around to keep him away from gangs.\n\nThen an assistant for Sonoma, Scalercio was recruiting another player when he saw Allen throw an opponent to the ground for the first time.\n\n\"I kinda forgot about the guy I was actually recruiting,\" Scalercio said.\n\nAllen ended up at tiny Sonoma, a Division II school, because his academic progress wasn't fast enough to get him to Division I, where he probably belonged.\n\n\"He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field,\" the Hall of Fame said. \"Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant.\"\n\nIn retirement, Allen showed up at Sonoma basketball games -- the football program was dropped a couple of years after Allen left -- and happily signed autographs and posed for pictures.\n\n\"He's even bigger now than he ever was on campus,\" Tim Burrell, a friend of Allen's, said in 2013. \"Everybody loves him.\"", "source": {"uri": "newschannel5.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTVF"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was 52.\n\nAllen died suddenly on Sunday while on vacation with his family in Mexico, the Cowboys said.\n\nA six-time All-Pro who was inducted into the Pro Football of Hall of Fame in 2013, Allen said few words but let his blocking do the talking.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,\" the Cowboys said Monday. \"His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\"\n\nThe former Sonoma State lineman drafted in the second round by the Cowboys in 1994 -- the year before the last of the franchise's five Super Bowl titles -- Allen once bench-pressed 700 pounds while dumbfounded teammates watched, then mobbed him.\n\nAllen was feared enough among his peers that notorious trash-talker John Randle of the Minnesota Vikings decided to keep to himself when he faced the Cowboys, so as to avoid making Allen mad.\n\n\"He never said nothin',\" Nate Newton, one of Allen's mentors on Dallas' offensive line, told The Associated Press for its Hall of Fame story on Allen 11 years ago. \"Every now and then you'd hear him utter a cuss word or hear him laugh that old funny laugh he had.\"\n\nAllen entered the Hall of Fame about a year after his mother died, knowing her presence would have helped him get through a speech after a career spent trying to avoid the spotlight.\n\n\"I miss her,\" Allen said before going into the hall. \"Whenever I'd get nervous or had a big game and got nervous, I'd give her a call, and she'd start making me laugh.\"\n\nThe Cowboys were coming off consecutive Super Bowl wins when they drafted Allen. He was surrounded by Pro Bowl offensive linemen but didn't take long to get noticed, eventually making 11 Pro Bowls himself.\n\nLate in his rookie season, Allen saved a touchdown by running down Darion Conner when it looked like the New Orleans linebacker only had Troy Aikman to beat down the sideline. Most of the rest of his career was defined by power -- first as a tackle, where the Cowboys figured he would be a mainstay, and ultimately as a guard.\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\" the Hall of Fame said in a statement. \"What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension.\"\n\nAllen spent his final two seasons closer to home with the San Francisco 49ers. Then, true to his personality as a player, Allen retired to a quiet life in Northern California with his wife and three kids.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul -- his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III,\" the Cowboys said.\n\nAllen was playing at Butte College when his coach at Sonoma State, Frank Scalercio, discovered him at the junior college where the lineman landed after attending four high schools in the Los Angeles area in part because his mom moved him around to keep him away from gangs.\n\nThen an assistant for Sonoma, Scalercio was recruiting another player when he saw Allen throw an opponent to the ground for the first time.\n\n\"I kinda forgot about the guy I was actually recruiting,\" Scalercio said.\n\nAllen ended up at tiny Sonoma, a Division II school, because his academic progress wasn't fast enough to get him to Division I, where he probably belonged.\n\n\"He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field,\" the Hall of Fame said. \"Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant.\"\n\nIn retirement, Allen showed up at Sonoma basketball games -- the football program was dropped a couple of years after Allen left -- and happily signed autographs and posed for pictures.\n\n\"He's even bigger now than he ever was on campus,\" Tim Burrell, a friend of Allen's, said in 2013. \"Everybody loves him.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Allen and his wife, Janelle, had two daughters and a son together.\n\nAllen was a key member of the Cowboys' success during the mid'90s, helping them to a Super Bowl 30 championship in the 1995 season that cemented them as a dynasty. The 6-foot-3, 325-pound guard was a seven-time First-team All-Pro and an 11-time Pro Bowler in his Hall of Fame career.\n\nAllen was a second-round pick (46th overall) by the Cowboys in the 1994 NFL Draft. He played college football at Butte and Sonoma State before emerging as one of the greatest draft steals in the history of America's Team.\n\nAlso Read: REPORT: New Details Reveal The Dallas Cowboys' Latest Plans For QB Dak Prescott As Trade Rumors Continue To Swirl\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys icon was also named to the 1990s and 2000s All-Decade Teams, as well as the NFL's 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 2011, Allen was added to the team's Ring of Honor.\n\nAllen played for Dallas from 1994 to 2005 before spending his final two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with Larry Allen's family and friends, as well as the Cowboys organization, during this devastating time.\n\nLarry Allen Was Pivotal In Dallas Cowboys' Dynastic Run\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys had won back-to-back Super Bowls in 1992 and '93, with both victories coming against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nBut with the Green Bay Packers emerging as an NFC power, and with the San Francisco 49ers in the midst of their own dynastic run, the Cowboys needed a couple of pieces to win that third Super Bowl.\n\nLarry Allen proved to be the difference-maker in Dallas, adding that game-wrecking offensive lineman to block for Emmitt Smith while helping keep Troy Aikman upright. If not for Allen, the Cowboys might have never won a third Super Bowl in the '90s, nor remain a consistent playoff contender in the back half of the decade.\n\nAlso Read: NFL Fans Are Calling Out Cowboys QB Dak Prescott On Social Media Over His Boldfaced Lie", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte,_Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butte, Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butte, Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmitt_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmitt Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Aikman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Aikman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-882944106-1-1024x563-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Allen was 52 years old.\n\nThe Cowboys announced his passing in a Monday statement.\n\nIf you're newer to pro football, and you didn't see Larry Allen in his prime, you missed Mozart the way it should be played.\n\nFrom the Pro Football Half of Fame:\n\nAllen began his college football career at Butte Junior College in Oroville, Calif., before transferring to Sonoma State, a Division II school near San Francisco. He quickly developed a reputation as a dominant lineman, and his stock rose among NFL scouts. The Dallas Cowboys used their second-round pick, 46th overall, in 1994 on Allen. He proved his worth by providing versatility for the Cowboys. He played every position on the offensive line, except center, during his 12 seasons in Dallas before playing two final years with the San Francisco 49ers (2006-07).\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 325 pounds, Allen possessed great athleticism to complement his size and incredible strength. He started 10 games in his rookie season and split time between guard and tackle. In his second season, he was placed in the right guard spot and helped pave the way for Emmitt Smith, who set a Cowboys single-season record with 1,773 yards rushing as Dallas finished fifth in the NFL for total offense. Allen's contribution was recognized as he was named All-Pro and named to the Pro Bowl for the first of 11 times in his career.\n\nAllen continued to shift between guard and tackle and continued to earn All-Pro honors and Pro Bowl nods as a guard. He finished the 1997 campaign and played all of 1998 as the Cowboys' left tackle. His job of protecting Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman's blindside earned Allen All-Pro and Pro Bowl recognition in 1998.\n\nAllen is among the rare group of players who have been named to multiple NFL All-Decade Teams (1990s and 2000s). A veteran of 203 career games, he played in two NFC Championship Games and was the starting right guard in the Cowboys' 27-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.\n\nHe was named the NFL's Offensive Lineman of the Year by the NFL Alumni in 1997 and by the NFL Players Association as the NFC Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1996 and 1997.\n\nHe is a member of the NFL 100 All-Time Team as a guard and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2013.\n\nFrom Pro Football Hall of Fame President Jim Porter:\n\n\"The National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen. What he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension. In a six-season span, he was named All-Pro every year, and one of those seasons came when the Cowboys needed him to step in at tackle.\n\n\"He could literally beat the will out of his opponents, with many quitting midgame or not dressing at all rather than face him, but that was only on the field. Off it, he was a quiet, gentle giant.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Janelle; daughters, Jayla and Loriana; and son, Larry III.\"\n\nHow great was Larry Allen? He was nearly mythical, and as always, the tape tells the story -- and those defenders who had to deal with Allen on the field have filled in any blanks.", "source": {"uri":

He was 52.\n\nAllen died suddenly while on a family vacation in Mexico, as announced Monday by the Dallas Cowboys, for whom he excelled as a guard from 1994-2005.\n\nUpon graduating from Vintage High in Napa, Allen played Butte Junior College and Sonoma State before the Cowboys selected him in the second round of the 1994 draft. He made the Pro Bowl 11 times, was honored First-Team AP All-Pro six times, and he played out his NFL career with the 49ers from 2006-07.\n\n\"My goal was simple, to earn a seven-word letter called 'respect,' \" Allen said in his 2013 enshrinement speech at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. \"The respect of my teammates, opponents, and the NFL. Today, my mission is complete. I also played hard, whistle to whistle, to make my opponents submit. And today, I'm submitting to you. I just can't wait to see my buddies.\"\n\nHe was a long-time East Bay resident. He owned a home in the Blackhawk region of Danville with his wife, Janelle, as they raised their daughters Jayla and Lorianna and son, Larry III, the latter of whom played football at De La Salle High-Concord and Harvard.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL,\" the Cowboys said in a statement. \"His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner. He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle -- whom he referred to as his heart and soul -- his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III.\"\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Allen grew up in Compton and didn't start playing football until his junior year at Centennial High.\n\nAllen (6-foot-3, 325 pounds) became a near-perennial Pro Bowl pick by the third season of his NFL career, all the way through his first season with the Mike Nolan-coached 49ers.\n\n\"When he'd go in the game, he'd look to coach and say, 'Run (expletive) here,' \" running back Frank Gore said in 2013, ahead of Allen's Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremony. \"They'd call the play, and we'd be successful. I'm happy to say I played with him.\"\n\nGore ran for a career-high 1,695 yards in that 2006 season with Allen at left guard.\n\nLeft tackle Joe Staley joined the 49ers in 2007 and quickly got tips from Allen, which he recalled in 2013: \"It was my fifth day of training camp, and I had gotten beat about 10 times in a row on 1-on-1s. I was real passive and intimidated by everybody. After I get beat another time, (Allen) goes in his booming voice, 'Hey rook, (expletive) punch him.' So I did the next time, whoever it was, and it worked. (Allen) says, 'Was that so hard.' \"\n\nAllen was a member of both the 1990s and 2000s NFL All-Decade Teams. He was a 10-time Pro Bowler with the Cowboys (second-most selections in franchise history). The NFL Players Association selected him as its 1996 and '97 NFC Offensive Lineman of the Year, and he was the NFL's Offensive Lineman of the Year by the NFL Alumni in 1997.\n\nAllen played in 203 NFL games, as well as two NFC Championship Games with the Cowboys. He started at right guard in the Cowboys' last Super Bowl victory, their January 1996 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XXX. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones presented Allen in his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction.\n\nReflecting on his time at Sonoma State, Allen said in a 2013 interview: \"I loved it. It was a great environment for me to thrive, a great experience. It was one of the best group of guys I've played with.\" Allen was named Northern California Athletic Conference Player of the Year as a senior, but the Cowboys still razzed him upon joining the NFL.

Allen passed away unexpectedly on Sunday while in Mexico on vacation with his family and his loss has already greatly impacted those who loved him. The former second-rounder was just 52 years old.\n\nFormer quarterback Troy Aikman, whom Allen blocked for for most of his career, took to social media to share his reaction to the news.\n\n\"Just received the heartbreaking news of the passing of our beloved teammate Larry Allen,\" Aikman tweeted. \"He was a HOF offensive lineman that dominated opponents regardless of the position played. Off the field, he was a gentle giant that loved his family. Rest in Peace LA.\"\n\nFormer running back Emmitt Smith, another great beneficiary of Allen's hard work in Dallas, also posted on social media about the loss of his former teammate and friend. Smith's grief is clearly visible in the video he shared shortly after learning about the Hall-of-Famer's death.\n\n\"I'm reflecting on one of the best offensive linemen I ever played with,\" Smith said. \"I'm at a loss for words right now. Such a good dude, great player, super person... It just breaks my heart. I know life is very fragile and we're only here for a moment. We need to make the best out of every moment and not take people for granted.\"\n\n\"All I can say is, live life to the fullest that you can... The one thing about Larry Allen I know, he had a big heart and he lived life to the fullest. A man of very few words but on the football field, he was a beast... My thoughts and prayers go out to his family. My heart is just broken.\"\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys announced the passing of Super Bowl Champion and Ring of Honor member Larry Allen on Monday morning. Allen played twelve seasons with the Cowboys, earning 10 Pro Bowl selections and seven first-team All-Pro honors. His ten Pro Bowl selections are the most all-time for a Cowboys offensive player. He helped the team win Super Bowl XXX over the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1996.\n\nThough he was a Cowboys legend, he also played two seasons for the San Francisco 49ers. He earned another Pro Bowl selection while in San Francisco. He earned his Hall of Fame induction and entered Canton as part of the class of 2013.\n\nAllen, a Compton, California native, played his college football first for the Butte Roadrunners, then the Sonoma State Cossacks. Though he didn't play Division-I football, he gained the attention of scouts at the East-West Shrine Game and Senior Bowl. The Dallas Cowboys opted to take him with the 46th overall pick in the second round of the 1994 NFL Draft. He was the highest-selected offensive lineman the Cowboys had ever taken at the time, though they went on to draft several more in the first round after finding success.\n\nAllen earned All-Rookie honors in his first season after an injury knocked out one of Dallas's starting linemen. He made his first NFL start at right guard the next season. He later moved between guard and tackle and eventually became Troy Aikman's blindside protector at left tackle.\n\nKnown for his freakish strength, Allen set the Cowboys record in the bench press. He put up 700 pounds, a mark that no Dallas player has hit since. First-round draft pick Tyler Smith now wears Allen's No. 73 jersey.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chavanelle@on3.com", "name": "Nikki

He was 52.\n\n\"Larry, known for his great athleticism and incredible strength, was one of the most respected, accomplished offensive linemen to ever play in the NFL. His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner,\" the Cowboys said in a statement.\n\n\"He was deeply loved and cared for by his wife, Janelle - whom he referred to as his heart and soul - his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III.\"\n\nAllen grew up in Compton, California, where he almost died as a six-week-old after contracting meningitis. He escaped another brush with death at the age of nine when he protected his brother from a neighbour and was stabbed 12 times in the head and neck.\n\n\"We would hear the gunfire outside our house, we would automatically roll out of the bed, lay on the floor until the shooting stopped, then get back in bed and go to sleep,\" his mother, Vera, told the Los Angeles Times in 1994. \"After a while, we got pretty good at that.\"\n\nA pathway to the professional game looked unlikely after he failed to graduate high school but he made his way up through community college before starring for Sonoma State, and was a second-round pick for the Cowboys in the 1994 draft.\n\nAt 6ft 3in, Allen was not particularly tall for an offensive lineman but he weighed 325lbs, could dunk a basketball and was known for his strength - he could bench press 700lbs - and ferocity.\n\nAnother hall of famer, Michael Strahan, described the effect Allen had on opponents. \"Players will watch him on film during the week and then pull up with some mysterious injury or flu or something. We call that catching 'Allen-itis,'\" Strahan once observed.\n\nBut aside from his physical gifts, Allen was also a keen student of the game.\n\n\"I used to tell people that Larry was a quiet man until the ball was snapped, but honestly, Larry talked all the time. He was always asking questions, as much as any player I coached,\" former Cowboys offensive line coach Hudson Houck told the Dallas Cowboys Star Magazine. \"And we would talk about football for hours, after practice, watching film, he always wanted to know about technique and his favorite question was, 'Coach, what if this happens?' He wanted a plan for every possible situation ... Larry is one of the most intelligent players I coached in 40-plus years.\"\n\nAllen was named to the first of his 11 Pro Bowls in 1995 and won the NFL championship with Dallas the same season. He was also a six-time All-Pro and was chosen for the NFL All-Decade team for the 2000s. He joined the San Francisco 49ers in 2006 and played his final two seasons with the team before retiring in 2007. His son, Larry Jr, played football for Harvard and joined the Cowboys briefly as an undrafted free agent in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_lutz@theguardian.com", "name": "Tom Lutz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Strahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Strahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Houck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hudson Houck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bench press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e1848cbc8ea7219220c671805cc959db7af1a8a/0_190_5070_3041/master/5070.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=38df0d510d7df7a3fce44018fba5673f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Three months later my mother said, I'm not raising any punks, so she made me fight this guy. She said you will fight him until you win. First day I lost. Second day I lost.

I just knew I had to win every play, and that's the reason why I'm here today.\"\n\nHe also spoke about his dad:\n\nI'd also like to thank my father. On the other end, he taught me to never get mad, but to get even, to control my temper. I also used that in the game of football. I knew if I lost a play, I had 45 seconds to get even. I'd like to say thank you to my brother, Von, happy birthday, little brother.

His versatility and dependability were also signature parts of his career. Through that, he continued to serve as inspiration for many other players, defining what it meant to be a great teammate, competitor and winner.\"\n\nIt's obviously a tragic moment for his family and for the fans who loved Larry Allen, and while there will be no shortage of tributes and memories shared by those in the NFL community, I think we should all look back on and remember just how all-around impressive Larry Allen was.\n\nFor starters, he was one of the toughest humans to ever walk the earth. Allen did not have an easy childhood and the struggles started when he was just six weeks old. He contracted meningitis and nearly died but was somehow able to make a full recovery.\n\nHe was raised in the heart of Compton and frequently had to hide on the floor with his mother while gangs had shootouts in the streets outside. At the age of 9 he was stabbed 12 times in the head and shoulder while protecting his brother from an attack.\n\nWhile all of that could have easily washed him out and made him just another forgotten statistic, he had something that few others in the world possessed: athletic ability and strength that rivaled the greatest athletes of all-time.\n\nAt his first day at Sonoma State, he dunked a basketball, with two hands, while wearing flip flops, having just gotten out of a car after an 8 hour drive. In a game against UC Davis his showed his incredible power by knocking unconscious a defensive tackle, linebacker, and safety on the same play. (Read that last line again).\n\nIn the NFL, he ran down one of the fastest linebackers of all-time (Darion Conner who ran a 4.77 forty in college) to prevent a pick-six in his rookie season.\n\nHis on-field play will forever be remembered by NFL fans but his strength accomplishments off the field are just as equally impressive.\n\nDuring the Strongest Man Contest at the 2006 Pro Bowl, Larry Allen benched 225 for 43 (!) reps despite being in the league for 11 seasons at that point, beating the next highest total by 8 reps.\n\nThere's a story of him getting into a competition off camera with La'Roi Glover in 2002 who had previously won the Pro Bowl Bench contest with 33 reps. According to Dallas head coach Barry Switzer, after La'Roi chirped at him for a little while, Larry told the guys to put 315 on the bar and he benched it 44 times. Around the same time he was squatting 900 pounds.\n\nAnd of course, there's an iconic video of him benching 700 pounds in nothing but a t-shirt, and while you can argue that he may have gotten a little help from his teammates, the fact that he worked up to it by getting well over 600 pretty easily pretty much shows what he's capable of.\n\nRest in peace to the great Larry Allen, one of the best football players of all-time, and without a doubt one of the strongest, toughest SOBs to ever walk the face of the earth.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2000 United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meningitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darion_Conner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darion Conner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La'Roi_Glover", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La'Roi Glover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Switzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barry Switzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Larry-Allen.png?fit=1200%2C716&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Over the next decade, the remarkably athletic big man was one the centerpiece of an offensive line that paved the way for Emmitt Smith to become the NFL's all-time leading rusher.\n\nOne of Allen's most iconic plays occurred late in his rookie season on Monday Night Football, when he chased down New Orleans Saints linebacker Darion Conner to deny him a pick-6.\n\nThat's 6'3\" and 325 pounds motoring down the field to save a touchdown. New Orleans would only get a field goal out of the ensuing possession in an eight-point loss.\n\nAllen was an 11-time Pro Bowl player and a seven-time first-team All-Pro selection. He won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in 1995, and was named to the NFL's All-Decade team for the 1990s and 2000s. His offensive line teammates for the 2000s included Seattle Seahawks greats Steve Hutchinson and Walter Jones.\n\nWhile Allen's best years were at left guard, he also played right guard, right tackle, and left tackle. His final two seasons were with the San Francisco 49ers, before retiring in 2009. And you better believe there was no one stronger than Larry Allen.\n\nShortly after his retirement, Allen was inducted into the Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2011 during Dallas' 23-13 win over the Seattle Seahawks.

Allen earned a whopping 11 Pro Bowl nods and six first-team All-Pro selections, along with one Super Bowl.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2013 and is widely considered one of the very best and most respected offensive linemen in the history of the sport.\n\nAllen, who played mostly guard but also spent some time at tackle, had rare athleticism for a 6-foot-3, 335-pound frame. That was on full display during a game against the New Orleans Saints in which he chased down a linebacker following an interception to prevent a possible touchdown.\n\nAllen's strength was also ridiculous.

He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame class in 2013 on his second ballot.\n\nVikings WR Justin Jefferson resets WR market with massive contract Jauan Jennings deserves all of his flowers and probably more 49ers have plenty of cap space to work with after June 1", "source": {"uri": "ninerswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Niners Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_madson@ninerswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Kyle Madson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stockton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stockton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jauan_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jauan Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoma_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonoma State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butte College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/77/2020/06/usatsi_2506301.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1098, "textEnd": 1104}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

In fact, it was Allen's crushing block of Steelers All-Pro linebacker Greg Lloyd during the opening drive of Super Bowl XXX that sprung running back Emmitt Smith loose for a 23-yard gain. The long run helped set up the game's first score as the Cowboys ultimately became the first team to win three Super Bowls over a four-year span.\n\nAllen is an all-time great, and among the greatest players to ever play for the Cowboys. Here's a look at the company Allen keeps.\n\n*Seasons played in Dallas in parenthesis\n\nHonorable mention: Mel Renfro, CB (1964-77)\n\nThe Cowboys' first of many dominant defensive backs, Renfro's 52 career picks is still the most in franchise history. A 10-time Pro Bowler, Renfro won two Super Bowls as a member of the Cowboys' vaunted Doomsday defense during the 1970s.\n\n10. Jason Witten, TE (2003-17, 2019)\n\nA fan favorite during his years with the Cowboys, Witten -- an 11-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro -- is the franchise's career leader in receptions (1,215) and receiving yards (12,977). Witten, who will be eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame in 2026, owns the unofficial title as the greatest tight end in Cowboys history and one of the franchise's best players without a Super Bowl ring.\n\n9. Zack Martin, OG (2014-present)\n\nIf you said that Martin is the Cowboys' best player this century, it would be hard to dispute that. Martin's seven All-Pro nods is tied for the most in franchise history, while his nine Pro Bowl selections is tied for the second most in franchise annals. Martin's pass protection over the years has provided clear sight lines for both Tony Romo and Dak Prescott. He also played an integral role in Ezekiel Elliott leading the NFL in rushing in both 2014 and 2016.\n\n8. Tony Dorsett, RB (1977-87)\n\nDorsett was the missing piece to the Cowboys' championship puzzle. The speedy running back helped lead the Cowboys to victory in Super Bowl XII as a rookie while becoming the first player to win the Heisman Trophy, a national title and a Super Bowl. Dorsett retired as the Cowboys' all-time leading rusher and is still the owner of the longest play (a 99-yard touchdown run) in franchise history.\n\n7. Larry Allen, OL (1994-2005)\n\nAmong all the Cowboys' 1990s stars, Allen is the most decorated as far as Pro Bowls and All-Pros are concerned. His 10 total Pro Bowl nods is the third most of any player in franchise history and two more than his closest teammate. Allen's six All-Pro nods is the fourth-highest mark in team annals.\n\n6. Randy White, DT (1975-88)\n\nNicknamed \"The Manster,\" White wreaked havoc on opposing defenses during his 14-year career. His greatest moment took place in Super Bowl XII, when he shared game MVP honors with linebacker Harvey Martin. White's seven All-Pro nods is tied for the most in franchise history.\n\n5. Michal Irvin, WR (1988-99)\n\nRegarded as the heart and soul of the '90s Cowboys, Irvin was a physical, intimidating wideout who more than lived up to his \"Playmaker\" nickname. A 1990s All-Decade performer, Irvin made five straight Pro Bowls and was a key cog in each of Dallas' three Super Bowl wins over that span. His two touchdowns in Super Bowl XXVII contributed to the third-largest blowout win in Super Bowl history.\n\n4. Troy Aikman, QB (1989-2000)\n\nAikman's machine-like efficiency was a big reason why the 1990s Cowboys offense is in the conversation as arguably the greatest in pro football history. The first quarterback to win 90 games in a single decade, Aikman was a gaudy 11-4 in the postseason as the Cowboys' starting quarterback. He won Super Bowl XXVII MVP honors after riddling the Bills' defense to the tune of 273 yards and four touchdowns on 22 of 30 passing.\n\n3. Emmitt Smith, RB (1990-02)\n\nIf Irvin was the heart and soul, then Smith was the engine that drove the Cowboys' prolific offense. In 1992, Smith became the first rushing champion to also win the Super Bowl. A decade later, he rushed into the history books by becoming the NFL's all-time career rushing leader. Smith, who in 1993 was named both league and Super Bowl MVP, is also the Super Bowl's career rushing leader.\n\n2. Bob Lilly, DT (1961-74)\n\n\"Mr. Cowboy\" is also arguably the greatest defensive tackle in NFL history. In fact, Aaron Donald is the only defensive tackle ranked ahead of Lilly on ProFootballReference.com's Hall of Fame monitor.\n\nThe Cowboys' first great player, Lilly helped Dallas go from an obscure franchise to one of the NFL's best. An 11-time Pro Bowler and seven-time All-Pro, Lilly fittingly made history while helping the Cowboys win their first of five Super Bowls. In Super Bowl VI, his sack of Dolphins quarterback Bob Griese resulting in a 29-yard loss remains the largest loss of yardage for a single play in Super Bowl history.\n\n1. Roger Staubach, QB (1969-79)\n\nNo surprise here. Arguably the most famous Cowboy of them all, \"Captain America\" quarterbacked America's Team to four Super Bowls during the 1970s. The Cowboys won two of the games largely on the right arm of Staubach, who won MVP honors during Dallas' first Super Bowl win, a 24-3 win over a Dolphins team that would go on to win the next two Super Bowls.\n\nA member of the NFL's 100th Anniversary Team, Staubach's impact on the Cowboys was felt immediately upon being named the team's starter in 1971. The Cowboys did not lose a game that season after Tom Landry named Staubach the starter over veteran Craig Morton. Four years later, Staubach authored the first-ever \"Hail Mary\" pass that paved the way for the Cowboys' third-ever trip to the Super Bowl.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news",

To lose someone like Allen in this fashion -- in any capacity -- is absolutely heartbreaking. May the legendary offensive lineman rest in peace.\n\nIf there is one silver lining, though, it lets us fondly recount the massive imprint Allen left on the NFL.\n\nBeyond the concrete individual accolades -- six First-Team All-Pro selections, 11 Pro Bowls -- it was always abundantly clear Allen had broken the mold for your bog standard franchise offensive lineman. Short episodes of him demolishing the 2006 Pro Bowl Skills Competition were just the tip of the iceberg for this icon.\n\nHere are nine incredible stories about Allen's otherworldly athleticism and his sheer dominance from some of the people who knew him best during his career.\n\nJohn Madden's true appreciation\n\nThe late Madden never hid his affinity for players he genuinely appreciated as a broadcaster. Allen was one of them.\n\nMadden gushed about Allen's remarkable talent in 2011 after it was revealed he would join the Cowboys' Ring of Honor. More from ESPN:\n\n\"There are some times when you know that you are watching one of the best players ever [Allen],\" Madden said. \"When I watched a player it wasn't just the game we'd have, but also tape and film leading up to those games. At first you'd watch him and say, 'This guy's pretty good,' and then he'd keep going and going and he was so strong and had such good balance. Then you'd realize what it was you were seeing -- and that was one of the best of all time.\"\n\nMadden didn't stop there with Allen. He issued some of the highest possible praise.\n\n\"If somebody said to God, 'What should all the guards look like?'\" Madden said, \"Then he would send Larry Allen down.\"\n\nMarcus Spears knew beating Allen was an impossible task\n\nAllen had a knack for making professional football defenders feel like they were playing a different sport. His ex-Cowboys teammate, Marcus Spears, laid this fact out perfectly after having a spent in practices against him.\n\nVia ESPN:\n\n\"Felt like you were going against a brick wall,\" Spears said. \"He [Allen] was so good. He's the best offensive lineman to ever play, I think. I know that's saying a lot, but he went to the Pro Bowl at tackle and guard. Larry could do it all.\"\n\nMichael Irvin couldn't believe Allen's casual strength\n\nAnother of Allen's ex-Cowboys teammates, fellow Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, knew that the guard's strength wasn't something to be trifled with. The receiver recalled the time Allen humbled everyone with an astonishing bench press set during the 2006 Pro Bowl:\n\n\"That's good enough ... you can put the weights down and go get that check,\" Irvin told Allen after he bench-pressed 225 pounds for 43 reps with ease. \"He was so strong, I mean, god almighty.\"\n\nJohn Randle was humble enough to meet his match\n\nIn his heyday, few defensive linemen were as prolific as Minnesota Vikings icon John Randle. He would embarrass interior offensive linemen on a weekly basis during his own Hall of Fame career. Well, really, everyone except Allen.\n\nRandle detailed his experience while graciously presenting Allen as one of the greatest NFL players of all time to NFL Films:\n\nAllen let a young Justin Tuck know that he had no chance\n\nUsually, offensive linemen don't want to divulge the play call to the defense. For obvious reasons, it's better that the dynamic athletes on the other side of the ball are kept in the dark until the ball is actually snapped.\n\nAccording to two-time Super Bowl champion Justin Tuck, this never mattered to Allen. In fact, the stalwart guard would literally tell the opposition the ball was going through his hole by mimicking a truck sound because he knew they had no chance of beating him.\n\nHow terrifyingly awesome:\n\nWhen Allen left everyone speechless on a basketball court\n\nBack when Allen's legend was still burgeoning as a college amateur, some people wanted more proof in the pudding. To do so, Allen's coaches at Sonoma State put him through the paces... on the basketball court. They wanted to see if he could really dunk even despite his immense frame.\n\nThey were eventually left speechless.\n\nMore from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram:\n\n\"They tracked him [Allen] down on a basketball court, the same place Sonoma coach Tim Walsh took Allen when he showed up on campus. Walsh wanted to see the 6-foot-3 Allen lift his 320-pound frame for a dunk.\n\n\"You could have heard a pin drop when he slammed the ball,\" Sonoma head coach Tim Scalercio said. \"It was like in the movies where it just goes 'tick, tick, tick, tick' and stops.\"\n\nDan Dierdorf couldn't believe his eyes\n\nA Hall of Fame offensive lineman in his own right, it took a lot for Dierdorf to be impressed with someone's play in the trenches. As a rookie, Allen did it from the jump and from another position entirely. After watching Allen save a pick-six by running down a linebacker in 1994, Dierdorf glowed with praise.\n\nMore from The Athletic:\n\nAs a rookie, Allen had been forced to play tackle because Erik Williams had been injured. The Cowboys led 7-0 in the second quarter when a pass was deflected at the line of scrimmage. Darion Conner picks it off and runs it the other way. Allen runs him down the sideline and tackles him to save a pick-6 with Dan Dierdorf losing his mind at the marvel he just saw. \"This guy has a rocket booster strapped to his back. ... Look at this, folks -- 6-3, 325 pounds! I'm telling you, that is one of the most impressive athletic feats I have ever seen!\"", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Overcoming a challenging childhood and humble beginnings, he found solace and purpose on the gridiron.\n\nHis college career at Sonoma State University was a precursor to his NFL stardom, catching the attention of scouts with his sheer power and technique. In 1994, the Dallas Cowboys selected him in the second round of the NFL draft, a decision that would prove monumental for the franchise.\n\nThroughout his 12 seasons with the Cowboys, Allen's impact was profound. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing over 325 pounds, he was a physical marvel, known for bench pressing over 700 pounds and bulldozing defenders with ease.\n\nHis versatility allowed him to excel at both guard and tackle positions, earning him 11 Pro Bowl selections and 7 First-Team All-Pro honors. Allen's tenure with the Cowboys was highlighted by his role in securing Super Bowl XXX, where his protection of quarterback Troy Aikman and paving the way for running back Emmitt Smith were pivotal.\n\nOff the field, Allen was equally revered. Known for his quiet demeanor and fierce dedication, he mentored younger players and gave back to the community. His induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013 cemented his status as one of the greatest linemen ever to play the game.\n\nLarry Allen's death is a significant loss, not just for the Cowboys but for the entire sports world.

Here he is at the Pro Bowl, bench pressing 225 pounds 43 times while wearing a gold watch. That's one of the coldest things any NFL player has ever done.\n\nHe's also on video bench pressing 700 pounds. I'm now motivated to get up and go to the gym because of him.\n\nAllen was a physical specimen on the field, plowing defensive tackles like a combine harvester. John Deere needed to sponsor him immediately because what he did to folks on the field is outrageous.

A key ingredient to their success has been the presence of exceptional quarterbacks.\n\nSo, let's look at the top 10 quarterbacks in franchise history, who have each contributed significantly to America's Team's legacy.\n\nEddie Lebaron makes the list for being the first-ever starting quarterback in Cowboys' history. Lebaron went winless in his first season with the Cowboys but rebounded and made one Pro Bowl in his four-year stint with the Cowboys.\n\nQuincy Carter was taken in the second round of the 2001 draft by the Cowboys to be the successor to Troy Aikman.\n\nCarter was known for his poor decision-making, throwing more interceptions than touchdowns with the Cowboys. His last season with the Cowboys in 2003 was his best, with 17 passing touchdowns, 21 interceptions, and leading the Cowboys to the playoffs for the first time since 1999.\n\nWhile Bledsoe's tenure with the Cowboys was brief and mediocre, his time with the team is remembered for his pivotal role when the Cowboys transitioned from him to Tony Romo as the starting quarterback.\n\nBledsoe's experience and leadership were pivotal in Romo's early success, even if his on-field performance wasn't anything special.\n\nDrafted in the first round of the 1965 NFL Draft, Morton initially served as a backup to Don Meredith. He became the starting quarterback in 1969, leading the Cowboys to a 10-4 record and the playoffs. His most notable achievement came the following year when he took the Cowboys to the Super Bowl but lost to the Baltimore Colts.\n\nMorton served as a backup to Staubach in his only Super Bowl win.\n\nDanny White's only Super Bowl with the Cowboys came when he was a Punter; however, he also had tremendous success leading the charge on offense. White took over as the starting quarterback following Staubach's retirement, leading the Cowboys to five playoff appearances and three consecutive appearances in the NFC Championship game from 1980 to 1982.\n\nDon Meredith was one of the original members of the Cowboys and helped the team make a name for itself in the 1960s. Meredith was known for his strong arm, toughness, and leadership, leading the Cowboys to consecutive NFL Championship games in 1966 and 1967. You can always tell if someone is a real Cowboys fan if they have heard of Don Meredith.\n\nRomo was known for his impressive playmaking and ability to evade sacks. He holds several Cowboys franchise records, including most passing yards, passing touchdowns, and game-winning drives.\n\nDespite facing criticism for his playoff performance, winning only two playoff games, he earned four Pro Bowl selections and was highly regarded for his clutch moments in the regular season.\n\nIf Prescott's career ended today, he would be second in franchise passing yards, touchdowns, and game-winning drives and fourth in wins. Prescott stormed onto the scene in his rookie season, leading the Cowboys to a 13-3 record.\n\nThe Cowboys had found their new star quarterback. Unfortunately, his career has shaped like Romo's, with just two playoff wins thus far and five appearances.\n\nTroy Aikman was not known for putting up gaudy numbers. Instead, he was known for something much more important: winning.\n\nAikman always shined when the lights were brightest, elevating his game when the Cowboys won three Super Bowls in four years as he led the offense.\n\nNicknamed Roger the Dodger or Captain Comeback, Staubach was known for performing when it mattered most, orchestrating 13 fourth-quarter comebacks and 21 game-winning drives.\n\nStaubach is widely regarded as the best quarterback of his era. He threw for 22,700 yards and 153 touchdowns, with a passer rating of 83.4.\n\nThese quarterbacks have made the Cowboys into the most valuable franchise in sports.\n\nDespite their recent failure to win a Super Bowl, the Cowboys still have the third most Super Bowls, fourth most playoff wins, the most regular season wins, and the most Hall of Famers since they were founded in 1960.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Meredith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Don Meredith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quincy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "America's Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Aikman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy Aikman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Romo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danny White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3900,h_2193,x_0,y_381/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cowboys_country/01hz5hmbqgb1p9ba4gvg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621044", "eventUri": "eng-9621044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

and Pro Bowler lifted 700 lbs", "body": "NFL fans are mourning the loss of one of the league's most formidable players, Larry Allen, who passed away on Sunday at the age of 52 while vacationing in Mexico.\n\nAllen, widely regarded as one of the greatest offensive linemen in NFL history, left an indelible mark on the sport with his unparalleled strength and resilience.\n\nAllen's career was filled with numerous feats of strength, but none more iconic than his 700-pound bench press in 2001.\n\nWitnessed by his then-offensive line coach Hudson Houck, this monumental lift became a testament to Allen's extraordinary physical prowess.\n\nHouck described the moment with awe, likening it to a scene from a Popeye cartoon, where the barbell appeared to bend under the massive weight.\n\nAllen's journey to this legendary status was marked by consistent, rigorous training.\n\nDespite rarely lifting weights in high school, he displayed remarkable strength early on, benching 400 pounds with ease at Butte Junior College and manhandling 500 pounds by the time he left Sonoma State.\n\nDrafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 1994, professional weight training helped him surpass 600 pounds on the bench press and achieve an astounding squat of 900 pounds.\n\nAt the 2006 Pro Bowl, at 34 years old, Allen benched 225 pounds 43 times, securing the event's strongest man title and cementing his legacy as a powerhouse.\n\nBeyond the weight room, Allen's strength translated to the football field where he used his immense power to dominate opponents.\n\nHis game-day goal was to make opponents quit, often succeeding with a powerful 'punch' that left many dazed and even injured.\n\nLarry Allen's career was decorated with numerous accolades, including his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nA member of the All-Decade team for both the 1990s and 2000s, Allen's 14-season career saw him selected for 11 Pro Bowls and seven All-Pro teams, primarily with the Cowboys before finishing with the 49ers.\n\nAs the NFL community reflects on his legacy, Larry Allen will be remembered not only for his historic 700-pound bench press but also as a giant of the game who exemplified strength, dedication, and unmatched athleticism.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Allen", "type":

The police, who were reportedly searching for sponsors of the #EndBadGovernance protest, allegedly seized books and other items during the raid.\n\nThe NLC condemned the operation, calling it unacceptable and issued an ultimatum to the police to return the confiscated books.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Force Spokesperson Muyiwa Adejobi explained that the NLC was not the target of the operation.

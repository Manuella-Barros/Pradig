But he recorded a video saying the Heat would have beaten the Celtics if he had been healthy and would have taken down the Knicks had they matched up.\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious?'\" Riley said. \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston, if you're not on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut in your criticism of those teams.\"\n\nButler has two years left on his current contract, though he has a player option for roughly $52 mill for the 2025-26 season. The Heat can offer Butler, 34, a new contract this summer to keep him in Miami beyond that, but Riley told reporters in Miami that the front office has not discussed that prospect internally yet, nor that any decision has been made to this point.\n\nStill, Riley was adamant that Butler will not be dealt away.\n\n\"No,\" Riley said when asked directly about trading him.\n\nIn Butler's five seasons in Miami, the Heat have made two NBA Finals appearances while reaching the Eastern Conference finals a third time. Riley remains appreciative of his star.\n\nBut Butler has also had trouble staying healthy and engaged during the regular season. Butler has yet to play more than 64 games in a regular season during his five seasons with the Heat. He played in 60 this season. His \"Playoff Jimmy\" nickname has been a double-edged sword, indicating how seriously he takes the playoffs -- and not the regular season.\n\nButler's durability, Riley said, will weigh into the Heat's decision on an extension.\n\n\"Who moves the needle the most on our team is Jimmy,\" Riley said. \"Jimmy moves the needle the most. He's an incredible player. What I said at the beginning about change is he's got to give it some thought himself for this team to be what he wants it to be, and what I want it to be, and (owner) Micky (Arison) and everybody else. This five year window, we've been pretty successful. We haven't won the chip and I think that bothers everybody.\"\n\nPat Riley's comments about Jimmy Butler today provided a surprising amount of transparency on two fronts. First, the Heat have no desire to trade Butler, despite the possibility of a tricky contract negotiation in the near future.\n\nYet while Riley did express a commitment to keeping Butler around, he made it clear he wanted to see some changes from Butler on and off the court. In particular, Riley saying Butler should \"keep his mouth shut\" is the kind of public pushback Miami has rarely given to their star during his time in Miami. Butler is known for having a boisterous personality at times, and his past teams have largely accepted it when he has been a successful face of their franchise. But historically, as team success starts to wear off, so does teams' patience for some of Butler's idiosyncrasies.\n\nOne big issue is the amount of games Butler and his teammates have missed the past two seasons. It's a point Riley repeated on multiple occasions during his news conference on Monday.\n\n\"We got a really good group of guys, and our No. 1 issue is player availability and having your guys playing every night,\" he said.\n\nAt this point, Butler has one big decision ahead of him: How will he react if contract extension talks don't go the way he wants them to this summer? That may be the biggest domino that determines the Heat's direction these next few seasons. -- Will Guillory, Heat and Pelicans reporter.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vorkunov@theathletic.com", "name": "Mike Vorkunov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "william_guillory@theathletic.com", "name": "William Guillory", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/06140134/GettyImages-1748996478-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

(Butler injured his knee during a play-in tournament loss the Philadelphia 76ers.)

It was made after Riley was asked about Butler's comments over the weekend about the Boston Celtics being lucky he was sidelined with an MCL sprain for the first-round series in which the Heat lost in five games.\n\n\"If I was playing Boston would be at home, New York would be at home,\" Butler said an interview while attending an event in Miami over the weekend.\n\nWhen asked about those comments, Riley said he didn't know if Butler was trolling or if he was serious, but added, \"If you're not on the court playing against the Boston Celtics or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nMost of Riley's 40-minute press conference focused on the availability of the Heat's players this past season. The Heat had the fifth-most games missed to injury in the league and used 35 different starting lineups as they went 46-36 and slipped into the play-in tournament for the second straight year. The Heat were then eliminated by the Celtics in five games, losing four games by double-digits. Butler missed the Heat's final play-in game and the entirety of the first round with a sprained MCL.\n\nHowever, during Riley's press conference, he appeared to take issue with Butler's limited availability. Butler, 34, was limited to just 60 games all season with various ailments and has yet to play more than 64 games in a season since joining the Heat in 2019.\n\nThis was a topic of conversation between Riley, Butler and Butler's agent Bernie Lee last summer. For the Heat to reach their goals of winning a championship, Riley said, the team needed more from Butler in the regular season so that they could avoid the tough road that includes the play-in tournament.\n\n\"That was discussed prior to last year,\" Riley said. \"We had a discussion with his agent about that. That was discussed thoroughly.\"\n\nButler missed the third of ninth games of the regular season for \"rest\" and \"personal reasons\" and missed 11 games from December to January with a calf and foot injury. There were also games he missed late - against the 76ers with a foot injury and against the Warriors with a migrane - that could have helped the Heat avoid the play-in tournament.\n\n\"There was a grey area in the regular season,\" Riley said when discussing appropriate reasons for missing games.\n\nAll of this puts the Heat's relationship with Butler into question and further complicates upcoming negotiations over a potential contract extension. Butler is eligible this summer to sign a two-year, $113 million extension that would keep him under contract through his age-37 season. The Miami Herald reported last week that Butler is expected to ask for the full maximum extension.\n\nHowever, Butler will be 35 going into next season, is showing signs of aging, and the front office is less-than-thrilled about their star player's availability.\n\nWhen asked about extension talks with Butler, Riley said the Heat aren't in a rush to engage in those negotiations since Butler will be extension eligible between this summer and the summer of 2025.\n\n\"We dont have to do that for a year,\" Riley said. \"We have not discussed that internally right now but we have to look at making that kind of commitment.\n\n\"If he requests [an extension], we can either accept or say we're going to think about it,\" Riley continued. \"We have not made a decision on it. I think we make too much out of this. He still has two years left on it.\"\n\nWhile the Heat would prefer to wait until next season, Butler might not be as patient. Butler will turn 35 in September, coming off an MCL sprain, and might want to lock in his final big contract now before possibly showing more signs of decline next season.\n\nIf Riley's press conference made anything clear, it's that the organization wants more from Butler in the regular season in order to justify the commitment that comes with a maximum contract extension worth upwards of $58.6 million and would keep Butler in Miami through 2027.\n\n\"Who moves the needle the most on our team? It's Jimmy. He's an incredible player,\" Riley said. \"Until you change the way you go about doing the things that were necessary to win -- whatever they are -- those things you are doing to try to win if they aren't working, must change.\n\n\"He has to give it some thought for this to be what he wants it to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "allucanheat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "All U Can Heat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5124,h_2882,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/115/01hx7926qtdnzd1ddz3e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

However, the standout points of information from the legendary executive and former head coach were made about Heat star Jimmy Butler and his comments after they were eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nButler missed all of the first round playoff series against the Boston Celtics as he suffered an MCL sprain in the first play-in tournament game against the Philadelphia 76ers. However, he would be on camera saying that if he was playing, the Celtics and even the New York Knicks would be watching the playoffs from their homes.\n\nLet's just say that Riley wasn't a fan of Butler's comments, which is sure to bolster and fire up the rumors of a potential split between the two parties. While all that talk is pure speculation at this point, Riley was asked about the comments made by the Heat star and first asked if he was \"trolling\" or not and eventually said that he is of the firm belief that \"if you're not on the court playing\" then \"you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\n\"For him to say that, you know, I thought, is that Jimmy trolling? Or is that Jimmy serious?,\" Riley said. \"If you're not on the court, playing against Boston, or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut and the criticism of those teams.\"\n\nRiley talks the rivalry Heat have with the Celtics\n\nRiley knows the rivalry the Heat have with the Celtics as the two teams have met four times in the last five seasons in the playoffs, and even farther than that with the \"Big 3\" era. It even goes as far back as when the former coach had the role with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s where them and Celtics rivalry was at their peak as Riley talked about the history and even complimenting the current iteration.\n\n\"We've played, I've been involved in competition the playoffs against certain opponents during the day even since we've been here, I hate to use that word, but the competition gets so tough that you don't like one another,\" Riley said. \"And so we played Boston four times, I think in the playoffs since Jimmy has been here so you do develop some, some dislike for the other team. But they are this year, I think, the best team in the league, the best roster in the league, and made some great moves. Brad Stevens did a great job and getting Holiday and Porzingis, built their bench a little bit differently.\"\n\nRiley speaks on giving Butler a potential extension\n\nThe topic of Butler and Miami is at a weird point where some believe like The Athletic that his time could be coming up soon with the team and could request a trade. This speculation is just that at the moment with no true sense, but what is known is that the 34-year old star is expected to seek a two-year contract extension worth \"worth about $113 million\" according to Anthony Chiang of The Miami Herald as July 7 will be the first day he becomes eligible.\n\nHowever, Riley wasn't quick to say that they would be extending Butler, saying that \"we don't have to do that for a year.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, we don't have to do that for a year and so we have not discussed that internally right now but we have to look at that and then making that kind of commitment,\" Riley said. \"Okay. And when do we do it? We don't have to do it until 25 actually, but we'll see. We haven't made a decision on it. And we really haven't really in earnest. discussed it. So we'll see what happens.\"\n\nIf there was one point that was honed in throughout the close to 45 minutes Riley spoke to the media, it was the fact that player availability was a huge problem this season. He is 100 percent right as Miami ranked top five in the NBA in missed games from players and had a franchise record 37 different starting lineups.\n\nRiley said there's a lot of factors in terms of Butler extension\n\nFor Butler, he was part of that as he played in 60 games this season, four less than the year prior. Riley was straight up about the contract extension and Butler, saying that it will be a huge decision for the franchise to \"commit to those kinds of resources unless you're somebody who's really going to be there\" every game, ending with \"that's the truth.\"\n\n\"Well, I mean, if you request we can either accept or we can say we're going to think about it,\" Riley said. \"We've not made a decision on it and I think you can make too much out of this. You still got two years left on the contract. Theoretically he's got a player option. But that's something that we have to give some real thought to based on a lot of factors. I don't want to go through the litany of factors right now because they all go up into different hypotheticals, but yeah, that's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless your somebody who's really going to be there and available every single night, that's the truth.\"\n\nThere's no doubt that the Heat have a busy offseason ahead as besides bolstering their roster with another possible star, they have to somewhat keep the foundation with Butler. They are looking to improve after a second straight finish as the eighth seed and losing to Boston in the first round.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_weinberger@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Zachary Weinberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Stevens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Stevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pat-Riley-tells-Jimmy-Butler-to-shut-up-after-viral-Celtics-comments.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-07", "textStart": 3089, "textEnd": 3095}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

There was a question about Jimmy Butler in the Miami Heat president's annual postseason talk Monday -- another question about Jimmy Butler, that is.\n\nThis entire Heat offseason will be one question about Butler's future followed by one about his attitude followed by another of contract extension and yet another of his trade value. This question was about Butler's words.\n\nButler did an interview after the Heat were trounced without him in the series by Boston and said: \"If I was playing, Boston would be at home. New York for damn sure would be\" home. Riley was asked simply if the Heat would have won with Butler on the court.\n\nThat hypothetical wasn't the issue as the Riley saw it. Being a pro was the issue.\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy being serious?' \" Riley said. \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston, or playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nYes, shots were fired Monday by Riley in his annual, postseason State of the Heat talk. You bet they were. This is how you know there's leadership and standards inside a business. This is what separates the Heat from most sports organizations, too: Riley has the championship rings to back up his thoughts.\n\nHe was asked, for instance, about the pressure most teams feel in signing a player like Butler to a extension when he's eligible, as Butler is in July. The extension would turn the remaining two-year, 110-millionon Butler's deal into a three-year, $160 million contract.\n\n\"There's no pressure,'' Riley said. \"The last extension, we gave it to him.\"\n\nHe said that it's a \"big decision\" for any franchise, \"unless you have someone who is going to be there, available, every single night.\"\n\nDo you see the issue here? Heat Culture is about playing the regular season hard. Jimmy hasn't played more than 64 games in the regular season his five Heat years. He played 60 this past season. He needed a break three games into the season. He watched tennis for eight hours one day and called in sick the next.\n\nThe Heat's top core of Butler, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro played just 19 games together. The Heat finished eighth in the East -- four games behind the second-place Knicks. See why this matters? See why the play-in game and opening series against Boston was avoidable?\n\nThe central question: Will Butler change? It's not just that he's 35 next season. It's that from his view he's led the Heat to the NBA Finals twice and conference finals three times in his five years. All might look good to him.\n\nSo, the instant option is a trade, though Riley echoed coach Erik Spoelstra in saying that wasn't going to happen. Maybe it doesn't considering the investment a team would have to make in Butler as time starts to take a toll. Or maybe they're just saying what they have to say to not crush any trade value.\n\nButler, of course, isn't the only NBA player to say the regular season is meaningless. Shaquille O'Neal did so back when he played with the Heat.\n\nRiley, of course, famously challenged O'Neal to a fight at a practice. That's part of why the Heat likes to say, \"We're not for everyone.\" Riley also famously called out LeBron James in this same postseason after the 2014-15 season about how, \"this stuff is hard,\" and to \"stay if he has the guts.\"\n\nLeBron didn't like that. Jimmy won't like this. It's a clash of eras in some form, as Riley doesn't understand things like the 65-game rule the NBA passed as a minimum to make player eligible for postseason awards. That gives them an excuse not to play 17 games, he feels.\n\nRiley was asked if he'll talk to Butler about playing more games\n\n\"That was discussed prior to last year,'' he said. \"We had a discussion with his agent about that. That was discussed thoroughly.\"\n\nSomething didn't translate.\n\nThis will end where it has to with the Heat trying to trade Butler. Don't read that wrong. They aren't going to tank-for-tomorrow like the Dolphins did. They won't do like the Marlins and trade players at the start of a season to build their minor leagues.\n\n\"Our organization is not about rebuilding,'' Riley said. \"I'll never use that word. We retool as needed to try to make it better.\"\n\nThey'll retool this offseason. Riley told of meeting LeBron for his postseason interview after their first season together that ended with a loss in the Finals. LeBron, remember, collapsed in the final games against Dallas. There's no other way to put it.\n\nLeBron interrupted Riley's meeting with Chris Bosh that ran late. He and Riley stared at each other. Finally, Riley said, \"I have to go to work on the roster to make it deeper.\"\n\nHe needs to do that now. Spoelstra needs to make a bottom-third offense score more. But the main thing is Butler. Will he change? Can he play more? At 35, 36 and 37, will he still be a postseason force?\n\nOne thing for sure is Riley, as strong leaders do, gave him some thing to think about: Shut up and shape up.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_hyde@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Dave Hyde", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bosh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tfl-l-riley-presser-07-050624.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Player availability is a big priority", "body": "Miami Heat forward Jimmy Butler looks on from the bench during the first half of Game 3 of an NBA basketball first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics, Saturday, April 27, 2024, in Miami.\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- If Jimmy Butler wants to see more pay, Pat Riley will want to see more play.\n\nAnd in simple terms, that is the entry point to this offseason for the Miami Heat.\n\nButler is almost certainly going to ask the Heat for a two-year extension this summer -- it could guarantee him as much as $113 million for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons -- and Riley said Monday in his annual end-of-season remarks that he isn't sure what the team will do when that moment arrives.\n\n\"We have not discussed that internally right now,\" Riley said. \"We have to look at making that kind of commitment and when do we do it. We don't have to do it until 2025, actually. But we'll see. We haven't made a decision on it, and we haven't really in earnest discussed it.\"\n\nThere are a number of factors the Heat will consider -- Butler's playing time among them. He is, without question, an elite player whose time in Miami has been loaded with some signature performances, especially in the playoffs. But he turns 35 in September and has missed 100 regular season games in his five Miami seasons, sitting out for injuries, rest or other reasons nearly 26% of the time.\n\nHe suffered a knee injury during the play-in tournament this season and missed Miami's five-game Round 1 playoff loss to Boston.\n\n\"That's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who's going to be there and available every single night,\" Riley said. \"That's the truth.\"\n\nRiley spoke for about 40 minutes, much of his remarks surrounding Butler, and he lauded Miami's highest-paid player multiple times -- even saying he \"moves the needle the most\" and that he's \"an incredible player.\" The Heat have 268 total wins in Butler's five seasons, fifth-most in the NBA over that span, and have made two NBA Finals appearances.\n\nBut he also didn't shy away from doling out criticism. Butler, speaking this past weekend at a Formula 1 race in Miami Gardens, said \"if I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would ... be at home.\"\n\nRiley didn't seem to like that much. \"I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious?' If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut on the criticism of those teams,\" Riley said.\n\nThe player availability issue goes well beyond just Butler. Miami used a franchise-record 37 different starting lineups in 89 games this season, including the two play-in contests. It had 18 different players make at least one start, largely because the lineup of available players seemed to always be changing from one night to the next.\n\nTyler Herro missed 40 games in the regular season, while Butler missed 22. Injuries dogged Miami all year long and only two players -- rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. (75) and captain Bam Adebayo (71) -- made more than 70 appearances for the Heat in the regular season. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last week that the team will take \"a deep dive\" into the reasons why players miss so much time, and Riley echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"We've got a really good group of guys and the No. 1 issue is player availability and having your guys healthy to play every night,\" Riley said. \"And we have to wrap our arms around that notion.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old Riley just completed his 29th season with the Heat, all of that as president and some of it as coach before giving that position up twice -- once in 2003 to Stan Van Gundy before taking back over in 2005 when Van Gundy stepped down, then for good in 2008 when Spoelstra was promoted.\n\nIn those 29 Miami seasons, the Heat have the second-best regular season winning percentage in the NBA (.569) behind only San Antonio (.628). Only the Spurs (175) and the Los Angeles Lakers (165) have more playoff wins in that span that Miami does (161).\n\nThe Riley record is basically beyond compare. In his 42 seasons as a head coach and/or executive, his teams -- the Lakers, New York and Heat -- have combined for 2,372 wins, including postseason.

I think we make too much out of this. He still has two years left on it.\"\n\n- Of the topic, Riley said, \"We haven't made a decision on it, in earnest, discussed it.\"\n\n- There also was significant talk of players having missed such extensive time this season.\n\n- That again took the subject toward Butler.\n\n- Of possibly offering Butler an extension, \"We do not have to do that for a year. We have not discussed that.\"\n\n- He said the team does not have to do it until 2025.\n\n- \"He still has two years left on a contract,\" Riley said.\n\n- Butler is under contract for next season, with a player option for the following season.\n\n- On Butler's missed time this past season, Riley said, \"That was discussed prior to last year. We had a discussion with his agent about that. That was discussed thoroughly. There was a gray area in the regular season.\"\n\n- Of his five-year core (Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro), Riley alluded to a year six.\n\n- Qualifying that with, \"that doesn't mean that change is a sinister word here.\"\n\n- Of Butler, Riley added, \"Jimmy moves the needle the most. He's an incredible player.\"\n\n- Riley said no to the notion of his team rebuilding.\n\n- \"I don't use the word,\" he said.\n\n- Of potentially making a big move this offseason, he said, \"We're not going to avoid anything.\"\n\n- He added, \"We have to try to control those things we can control.\"\n\n- He qualified that with, \"It's not about getting another star. You get another star, your bench gets weaker.\"\n\n- With that, he again mentioned, \"player availability.\"\n\n- Of the next steps for Bam Adebayo, Riley said, \"He made the changes to become a greater shooter.\"\n\n- Riley added, \"So Bam has to look at his game and sit with Coach and how can he get better and expand his game.\"", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ira_winderman@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Ira Winderman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaseya_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaseya Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Riley.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-07", "textStart": 459, "textEnd": 465}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The Heat lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought, is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious,\" Riley said. \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nButler was injured in the first quarter of the Heat's loss to the Philadelphia 76ers last month in the Play-In Tournament. He struggled the remaining three quarters, leading the Heat to a loss.\n\nIf they won, the Heat would have played the Knicks in the first round. The Knicks are coached by Tom Thibodeau, who was Butler's coach when he was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 2011. Instead, the Heat played the top-seeded Boston Celtics in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nButler said he felt the Heat would have defeated the Knicks in the first round if it would have happened.\n\n\"New York damn sure would be at home,\" Butler said in a video posted on social media. \"I love Tibs but I don't want Tibs.

We have not discussed that internally right now, but we have to look at making that kind of commitment,\" Riley told reporters.\n\nDespite the hesitance to sign him long-term, Riley said Butler will not be traded.\n\nWhile Riley called Butler an \"incredible player,\" he said that it will \"take some \"changes\" for Butler to be the best player on a championship team, appearing to reference Butler's availability over the last handful of the seasons. A knee injury kept Butler out of the playoffs this season, and the six-time All-Star has missed over 100 regular season games over the last seven seasons dating back to his first season with the Timberwolves.\n\nMORE: Why Jimmy Butler left the 76ers for Heat in 2019\n\nButler has been a high-level player since he arrived in Miami, but Riley's press conference served as a reminder of who is in control of the franchise. The 79-year-old Riley ripped Butler for trolling the Celtics during the Heat's swift first-round loss, asserting, \"If you're not on the court playing, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nButler claimed the Heat would have won the series if he were healthy, and he trolled the Celtics on Instagram after Miami earned its only win of the series in Game 2.\n\nThe Heat have earned a reputation as one of the most well-oiled machines in the NBA, consistently developing quality players and playing competitive basketball even when there is a talent disadvantage, but Riley's comments are the first hint that not all might be well in Miami.\n\nButler is under contract through the 2024-25 season with a $52.4 million player option for 2025-26. He's set to make $48.8 million next season.\n\nButler wants his contract to be extended from a two-year, $101 million deal into a three-year, $161.7 million deal this offseason, the Miami Herald reported. Such an extension would guarantee his contract through 2027 when he will be 37.\n\nRiley made it clear Monday that availability is Miami's top concern as it relates to a long-term commitment, and that comes as little surprise. Butler has missed at least 18 regular season games in each of the last four seasons, and that trend typically doesn't improve when a player enters his mid-to-late 30s.\n\nStill, the Heat saw how competitive they were against the Eastern Conference's best without Butler and don't have a readymade star ready to ascend to that lead role. A lack of an extension \"could lead to a disgruntled Butler,\" the Miami Herald said.\n\nMORE: Top 3 potential trade destinations for Brandon Ingram\n\nHere's a look at Butler's stats in each of his five seasons with the Heat:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Ingram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Ingram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/nba-canada--58e8a115-3107-42d1-9dd2-6897f0bd6ee8.png?itok=AbRAnG5Y", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

But the last year is a $52 million player option for the 2025-26 season.\n\nAccording to Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald, Butler is expected to seek a new two-year extension worth $113 million.\n\nRiley repeatedly talked about players' availability during his 43-minute presser, including blasting the NBA's 65-game eligibility rule, which he believes sent the players and their agents a message that \"it's okay to miss 17 games\" in the regular season.\n\nButler is notorious for laying low during the regular season and then switched to \"Playoff Jimmy\" mode in the postseason. He has never played more than 64 games since he moved to Miami in 2019.\n\nWhile Riley said that topic has been discussed with Butler's agent last year, he wanted Butler to shape up.

Butler's highly successful stay on South Beach, of course, began when the Sixers prioritized retaining Ben Simmons and Tobias Harris over Butler and agreed to sign-and-trade him to Miami when the Heat had minimal salary cap space,\" Stein wrote on his May 5 Substack newsletter.\n\nRiley, however, shut down those rumors.\n\n\"No,\" Riley said when asked if the Heat at least be open to considering a trade for Butler. \"Not right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobias Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1177490492-e1715022571321.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 264, "textEnd": 269}, {"amb": false, "date": "-07-07", "textStart": 454, "textEnd": 460}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 3268, "textEnd": 3273}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Player...", "body": "MIAMI (AP) - If Jimmy Butler wants to see more pay, Pat Riley will want to see more play.\n\nAnd in simple terms, that is the entry point to this offseason for the Miami Heat.\n\nButler is almost certainly going to ask the Heat for a two-year extension this summer - it could guarantee him as much as $113 million for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons - and Riley said Monday in his annual end-of-season remarks that he isn't sure what the team will do when that moment arrives.\n\n\"We have not discussed that internally right now,\" Riley said. \"We have to look at making that kind of commitment and when do we do it. We don't have to do it until 2025, actually. But we'll see. We haven't made a decision on it, and we haven't really in earnest discussed it.\"\n\nThere are a number of factors the Heat will consider - Butler's playing time among them. He is, without question, an elite player whose time in Miami has been loaded with some signature performances, especially in the playoffs. But he turns 35 in September and has missed 100 regular season games in his five Miami seasons, sitting out for injuries, rest or other reasons nearly 26% of the time.\n\nHe suffered a knee injury during the play-in tournament this season and missed Miami's five-game Round 1 playoff loss to Boston.\n\nFILE - Miami Heat president Pat Riley gestures as he speaks during an end of season NBA basketball news conference in Miami, Tuesday, June 20, 2023. Riley laid out the plan for the team's offseason on Monday, May 6, 2024, after a disappointing first-round exit to Boston and an injury-plagued regular season. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File)\n\n\"That's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who's going to be there and available every single night,\" Riley said. \"That's the truth.\"\n\nRiley spoke for about 40 minutes, much of his remarks surrounding Butler, and he lauded Miami's highest-paid player multiple times - even saying he \"moves the needle the most\" and that he's \"an incredible player.\" The Heat have 268 total wins in Butler's five seasons, fifth-most in the NBA over that span, and have made two NBA Finals appearances.\n\nBut he also didn't shy away from doling out criticism. Butler, speaking this past weekend at a Formula 1 race in Miami Gardens, said \"if I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would ... be at home.\"\n\nRiley didn't seem to like that much. \"I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious?\u00b4 If you\u00b4re not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut on the criticism of those teams,\" Riley said.\n\nThe player availability issue goes well beyond just Butler. Miami used a franchise-record 37 different starting lineups in 89 games this season, including the two play-in contests. It had 18 different players make at least one start, largely because the lineup of available players seemed to always be changing from one night to the next.\n\nTyler Herro missed 40 games in the regular season, while Butler missed 22. Injuries dogged Miami all year long and only two players - rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. (75) and captain Bam Adebayo (71) - made more than 70 appearances for the Heat in the regular season. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last week that the team will take \"a deep dive\" into the reasons why players miss so much time, and Riley echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"We've got a really good group of guys and the No. 1 issue is player availability and having your guys healthy to play every night,\" Riley said. \"And we have to wrap our arms around that notion.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old Riley just completed his 29th season with the Heat, all of that as president and some of it as coach before giving that position up twice - once in 2003 to Stan Van Gundy before taking back over in 2005 when Van Gundy stepped down, then for good in 2008 when Spoelstra was promoted.\n\nIn those 29 Miami seasons, the Heat have the second-best regular season winning percentage in the NBA (.569) behind only San Antonio (.628). Only the Spurs (175) and the Los Angeles Lakers (165) have more playoff wins in that span that Miami does (161).\n\nThe Riley record is basically beyond compare. In his 42 seasons as a head coach and/or executive, his teams - the Lakers, New York and Heat - have combined for 2,372 wins, including postseason. No single NBA franchise has more wins in those 42 seasons than Riley has accumulated during his stints with those three clubs.\n\nHe'll tweak things. But he's not changing his ways.\n\n\"Until you change the way you go about doing the things that are necessary to win, whatever they are, those things you\u00b4re doing to try to win, if they aren't working, let\u00b4s change,\" Riley said. \"And so, that doesn\u00b4t mean that change is a sinister word here. ...

Player availability is a big priority", "body": "MIAMI (AP) -- If Jimmy Butler wants to see more pay, Pat Riley will want to see more play.\n\nAnd in simple terms, that is the entry point to this offseason for the Miami Heat.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nButler is almost certainly going to ask the Heat for a two-year extension this summer -- it could guarantee him as much as $113 million for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons -- and Riley said Monday in his annual end-of-season remarks that he isn't sure what the team will do when that moment arrives.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We have not discussed that internally right now,\" Riley said. \"We have to look at making that kind of commitment and when do we do it. We don't have to do it until 2025, actually. But we'll see. We haven't made a decision on it, and we haven't really in earnest discussed it.\"\n\nThere are a number of factors the Heat will consider -- Butler's playing time among them. He is, without question, an elite player whose time in Miami has been loaded with some signature performances, especially in the playoffs. But he turns 35 in September and has missed 100 regular season games in his five Miami seasons, sitting out for injuries, rest or other reasons nearly 26% of the time.\n\nHe suffered a knee injury during the play-in tournament this season and missed Miami's five-game Round 1 playoff loss to Boston.\n\n\"That's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who's going to be there and available every single night,\" Riley said. \"That's the truth.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRiley spoke for about 40 minutes, much of his remarks surrounding Butler, and he lauded Miami's highest-paid player multiple times -- even saying he \"moves the needle the most\" and that he's \"an incredible player.\" The Heat have 268 total wins in Butler's five seasons, fifth-most in the NBA over that span, and have made two NBA Finals appearances.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut he also didn't shy away from doling out criticism. Butler, speaking this past weekend at a Formula 1 race in Miami Gardens, said \"if I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would ... be at home.\"\n\nRiley didn't seem to like that much. \"I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious?' If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut on the criticism of those teams,\" Riley said.\n\nThe player availability issue goes well beyond just Butler. Miami used a franchise-record 37 different starting lineups in 89 games this season, including the two play-in contests. It had 18 different players make at least one start, largely because the lineup of available players seemed to always be changing from one night to the next.\n\nTyler Herro missed 40 games in the regular season, while Butler missed 22. Injuries dogged Miami all year long and only two players -- rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. (75) and captain Bam Adebayo (71) -- made more than 70 appearances for the Heat in the regular season. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last week that the team will take \"a deep dive\" into the reasons why players miss so much time, and Riley echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"We've got a really good group of guys and the No. 1 issue is player availability and having your guys healthy to play every night,\" Riley said. \"And we have to wrap our arms around that notion.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old Riley just completed his 29th season with the Heat, all of that as president and some of it as coach before giving that position up twice -- once in 2003 to Stan Van Gundy before taking back over in 2005 when Van Gundy stepped down, then for good in 2008 when Spoelstra was promoted.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn those 29 Miami seasons, the Heat have the second-best regular season winning percentage in the NBA (.569) behind only San Antonio (.628). Only the Spurs (175) and the Los Angeles Lakers (165) have more playoff wins in that span that Miami does (161).\n\nThe Riley record is basically beyond compare. In his 42 seasons as a head coach and/or executive, his teams -- the Lakers, New York and Heat -- have combined for 2,372 wins, including postseason.

Player availability is a big priority - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale", "body": "MIAMI (AP) -- If Jimmy Butler wants to see more pay, Pat Riley will want to see more play.\n\nAnd in simple terms, that is the entry point to this offseason for the Miami Heat.\n\nButler is almost certainly going to ask the Heat for a two-year extension this summer -- it could guarantee him as much as $113 million for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons -- and Riley said Monday in his annual end-of-season remarks that he isn't sure what the team will do when that moment arrives.\n\n\"We have not discussed that internally right now,\" Riley said. \"We have to look at making that kind of commitment and when do we do it. We don't have to do it until 2025, actually. But we'll see. We haven't made a decision on it, and we haven't really in earnest discussed it.\"\n\nThere are a number of factors the Heat will consider -- Butler's playing time among them. He is, without question, an elite player whose time in Miami has been loaded with some signature performances, especially in the playoffs. But he turns 35 in September and has missed 100 regular season games in his five Miami seasons, sitting out for injuries, rest or other reasons nearly 26% of the time.\n\nHe suffered a knee injury during the play-in tournament this season and missed Miami's five-game Round 1 playoff loss to Boston.\n\n\"That's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who's going to be there and available every single night,\" Riley said. \"That's the truth.\"\n\nRiley spoke for about 40 minutes, much of his remarks surrounding Butler, and he lauded Miami's highest-paid player multiple times -- even saying he \"moves the needle the most\" and that he's \"an incredible player.\" The Heat have 268 total wins in Butler's five seasons, fifth-most in the NBA over that span, and have made two NBA Finals appearances.\n\nBut he also didn't shy away from doling out criticism. Butler, speaking this past weekend at a Formula 1 race in Miami Gardens, said \"if I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would ... be at home.\"\n\nRiley didn't seem to like that much. \"I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious?' If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut on the criticism of those teams,\" Riley said.\n\nThe player availability issue goes well beyond just Butler. Miami used a franchise-record 37 different starting lineups in 89 games this season, including the two play-in contests. It had 18 different players make at least one start, largely because the lineup of available players seemed to always be changing from one night to the next.\n\nTyler Herro missed 40 games in the regular season, while Butler missed 22. Injuries dogged Miami all year long and only two players -- rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. (75) and captain Bam Adebayo (71) -- made more than 70 appearances for the Heat in the regular season. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last week that the team will take \"a deep dive\" into the reasons why players miss so much time, and Riley echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"We've got a really good group of guys and the No. 1 issue is player availability and having your guys healthy to play every night,\" Riley said. \"And we have to wrap our arms around that notion.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old Riley just completed his 29th season with the Heat, all of that as president and some of it as coach before giving that position up twice -- once in 2003 to Stan Van Gundy before taking back over in 2005 when Van Gundy stepped down, then for good in 2008 when Spoelstra was promoted.\n\nIn those 29 Miami seasons, the Heat have the second-best regular season winning percentage in the NBA (.569) behind only San Antonio (.628). Only the Spurs (175) and the Los Angeles Lakers (165) have more playoff wins in that span that Miami does (161).\n\nThe Riley record is basically beyond compare. In his 42 seasons as a head coach and/or executive, his teams -- the Lakers, New York and Heat -- have combined for 2,372 wins, including postseason. No single NBA franchise has more wins in those 42 seasons than Riley has accumulated during his stints with those three clubs.\n\nHe'll tweak things. But he's not changing his ways.\n\n\"Until you change the way you go about doing the things that are necessary to win, whatever they are, those things you're doing to try to win, if they aren't working, let's change,\" Riley said. \"And so, that doesn't mean that change is a sinister word here. ... We have to change some things, but we surely are not going to rip anything apart here.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

After making it all the way to the NBA Finals as a No. 8 seed last season, Miami got plastered by the Boston Celtics as the No. 8 seed this time around. The Heat only won one game in the series, and truly never had a chance with Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier both out with injuries.\n\nThe Heat have been a middling team in the Eastern Conference over the last five years, but somehow have two unlikely appearances in the NBA Finals to show for it. Lead executive Pat Riley isn't satisfied. Riley met the media for the Heat's end-of-season press conference on Monday, and took several shots at Butler after he failed to stay healthy and productive this season.\n\nButler was captured on social media saying the Heat would have beat the Celtics and Knicks in the 2024 NBA Playoffs if he was healthy. That comment didn't sit right with Riley when the Heat are the team that's currently at home. Riley said Butler should keep his \"mouth shut\" after being unable to play in the playoffs this year.\n\nButler appeared in 60 games for the Heat this season, which is actually the second-most he's played in a season since 2018-2019. At the same time, Butler just wasn't an impactful as he usually is. The star wing turns 35 years old before next season, and seemed to be saving his top level of play for the playoffs all year. That made sense in theory, at least until an MCL injury knocked him out of the playoffs before they began.\n\nThere have been vague Butler trade rumors floating around since Miami was eliminated. Butler is up for an extension this offseason, and the Heat might be hesitant to give it to him after his lack of durability recently. Riley essentially said as much on Monday:\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe said the Heat could be in for an 'explosive' offseason in a recent podcast, and mentioned a Butler trade as something that shouldn't be ruled out. Butler has $48.7 million guaranteed on his contract for next season, and then has a $52.4 million player option in 2025-26.\n\nRiley didn't dance around the fact that players needed to be on the court if they want to be part of the Heat's long-term vision.\n\nButler wasn't the only Miami player who got a message from Riley. He also called Tyler Herro \"fragile\" while praising his work ethic.\n\nThe Heat played with fire by being a barely above-average team in the Eastern Conference this season, and this time they got burned. Miami's run the 2023 NBA Finals was inspiring and captivating, but it always felt a little bit like a fluke. With several key rotations from that team now elsewhere -- Max Strus and Gabe Vincent, in particular -- the Heat weren't able to recapture the same magic in the playoffs this year.\n\nRiley sounds fed up. The 79-year-old wants another championship, and he wants it now. He knows it's only going to happen if his best players are on the court.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricky_o_donnell@sbnation.com", "name": "Ricky O'Donnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Vincent", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabe Vincent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Strus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Strus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0B67xUvNZ-Ded3norIpx6GVDfvw=/0x0:2354x1177/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25435846/Screen_Shot_2024_05_06_at_1.12.57_PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Media attention was on Butler despite not playing against the Celtics, which irked Pat Riley. Tyler Herro's reliability and performance came under scrutiny, questions surround his role moving forward.\n\nThe Miami Heat were expected to make a deep playoff run this season after upsetting their way to the NBA Finals last season. While the Denver Nuggets made light work of Miami, the Heat were praised as a team that can show up in the postseason and march through the toughest competition the Eastern Conference has to offer.\n\nThis season, the Boston Celtics got their revenge and sent the Heat packing in five games. Boston had been dominant all season, but heading into the first-round matchup, there were some concerns that the Heat could make some magic for the second season in a row as the eighth seed.\n\nAn injury to Jimmy Butler in the Play-In Tournament loss to the Philadelphia 76ers stifled any chances the Heat had concerning the possibility of upsetting the Celtics.\n\nButler Talked All Series Despite not playing a game against Boston, Butler was a media darling\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the NBA media was fawning over Butler all series. Despite not playing a minute against the Celtics, Butler's outgoing personality and ability to joke around has enamored him with reporters.\n\nButler and Herro's Health, 2023-24\n\nPlayer\n\nRegular Season Games Missed\n\nPlayoff Games Missed\n\nButler\n\n22\n\n5\n\nHerro\n\n40\n\n0\n\nButler is known as a playoff performer who saves his best efforts for the end of the season, but this year's injury prevented him from coming through with his usual heroics. Despite his being unable to impact winning on the court, he was still at the center of media narratives, even after the Heat got eliminated.\n\nDuring the series, he encouraged fans to not worry about Boston, which was easily the best team in the league. Miami ended up having to worry, as Boston finished up the gentlemen's sweep.\n\nAfter the Heat were eliminated, President of the Heat and NBA legend Pat Riley told Butler to simmer down and didn't mince words while he was doing it.\n\n\"For him to say that, is that Jimmy trolling? Or is that Jimmy serious? If you're not on the court playing against Boston or playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nAs the Heat and Butler head into an offseason with their futures in question, Riley's comments have been taken by many to mean that Butler is short-lived for South Beach.\n\nHerro Was Also Called Out By Riley Jimmy Butler was not the only one to face some criticism\n\nAs the Heat stare down an offseason full of questions about their future, reliability will be at the center of the front office's decisions. If a player is not reliable and able to win games when it matters, expect the Heat to explore other options.\n\nOne player who has carved out an excellent NBA career in Miami is Tyler Herro, but he only played in 42 games this season. Unlike Butler, he did play in all five playoff games but averaged a disappointing 16.8 points on 34.9 percent shooting from three.\n\nDuring his postseason media availability, Riley spoke about Herro's reliability.\n\n\"He's been fragile a little bit. Broke his hand last year in the playoffs, had some injuries earlier in his career...he might have to go to another level nutritionally. he's gotten stronger, but as the season progresses you know you lose some of that. You don't pound the iron like you do in the offseason. He's got to make some adjustments, definitely.\"\n\nHerro has yet to play in more than 70 games in his five-year NBA career but has only missed one postseason due to injury. As the Heat aim to build a team centered around postseason success, the concern surrounding Herro is less availability and more quality of his play.\n\nRelated 2024 NBA Playoffs: Best Performers of The East's First Round The Eastern Conference saw a number of superstars rise up during the first round of the NBA playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nba_heat-gm-on-players.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Like 2023 against Miami, New York has homecourt advantage over Indiana as the higher seed.\n\nIf the Heat had beaten the Sixers in the Play-In Tournament, Miami and New York would've faced off in the first round. The Heat secured the No. 8 seed, which set them up for a first-round clash with the top-ranked Celtics. Miami stole a game but lost the series, 4-1.\n\nJimmy Butler missed the postseason with an MCL injury. After the Heat were eliminated, Butler said that Boston would \"be at home\" if he played, as would New York. If Miami and New York had advanced to the ECF, there would've been a rematch.\n\nJosh Hart hilariously responded to Butler's random shot on Instagram.\n\nButler even mentioned his former head coach Tom Thibodeau. He said Thibs \"wants\" him but that he doesn't want Thibs. Butler said he loves Thibodeau but wants to \"beat him to a pulp.\" Thibs was asked about Butler's rant, to which he said:\n\nOn Monday, Pat Riley held his end-of-season press conference. Riley was asked about Butler's comments, and he said he wondered if the forward was trolling or if he was being serious. It doesn't matter to Riley because Butler has no room to talk because the Heat are no longer in the playoffs.\n\nIt's weird for Riley and Knicks fans to be on the same side again, but Butler brought them together. Miami's president is right. You didn't see Julius Randle sound off on the Sixers in the first round and say that Philadelphia would've been swept if he had played.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nJimmy Butler recently went viral for his comments about where the Miami Heat would be if he was able to play in the playoffs, but it appears his team president, Pat Riley, isn't too happy with his comments.\n\nButler was seen in a video that circulated on social media talking about how the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks would be \"at home\" if he were playing, implying that his presence on the court with the Heat would've resulted in them not losing in the first round. Butler sprained his MCL during the Play-In Tournament, which led to him missing the first round.\n\nRiley spoke to media on Monday, where he was asked his thoughts on Butler's comments.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought is that Jimmy trolling, or is that Jimmy serious?\" Riley said. \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston, if you're not on the court playing against the New York Knicks you should keep your mouth shut and your criticism of those teams.\"\n\nThe message from Riley is pretty clear here, as the Heat are not, in fact, playing anymore in the playoffs as the Celtics and Knicks both moved on to the second round.\n\nTOM THIBODEAU HAS HILARIOUS RESPONSE TO JIMMY BUTLER'S SLIGHT TOWARD KNICKS: 'I'LL BEAT HIM TO A PULP'\n\nIn the video, Butler can be heard saying, \"If I was playing, Boston would at home, New York damn sure would be at home. Josh Hart? C'mon man.\"\n\nHe also jokingly said that he wanted to beat Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau to a pulp on the court, to which the veteran coach responded by saying the exact same thing to reporters ahead of the Knicks' first round matchup with the Indiana Pacers on Monday.\n\n\"Who?\" Thibodeau said on Sunday. \"I don't know him. But I'll beat him to a pulp.\"\n\nRiley also has a strong connection to the Knicks, having been their head coach from 1991-95 before he joined the Heat. Riley led the Knicks to the NBA Finals during the 1993-94 campaign when the team went 57-25.\n\nRiley's Heat made a Finals run last season, shocking everyone as they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and continued to wipe the Eastern Conference competition before losing to the Denver Nuggets in the final series of the season. Butler was a key piece in making that happen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Riley doesn't want to hear hypotheticals from Butler, whether he was \"trolling\" or not.

Jimmy Butler Could Get Very Messy This Summer", "body": "The Miami Heat were not able to duplicate last year's incredible run from the 8-seed to the NBA Finals, as this year they got taken out in five games by the top-seeded Boston Celtics in the first round. While they did shoot their way to a Game 2 win, the rest of the series showed the gulf between the two teams, which was widened considerably by the absence of Jimmy Butler (and Terry Rozier).\n\nThe way the season ended only complicated Miami's summer plans, as they now have to figure out what the best course of action is for both the short- and long-term. That includes whether to offer Jimmy Butler an extension, as he's eligible for a 2-year, $113 million extension offer this summer. On Monday, Pat Riley met with the assembled media and made it pretty clear that was not under serious consideration, and made some eyebrow raising comments regarding his star forward.\n\nThe first indication the Heat weren't ready to commit to Butler long-term came in this quote about having success in their recent \"5-year window,\" but never winning a title.\n\nFrom there, he was asked specifically about Butler's extension and said that hadn't been discussed internally, but that it was not something Miami felt they needed to to this summer.\n\nI highly doubt Butler would agree, and as Riley continued to talk, he made it clear that Butler's lack of availability night-to-night -- he's never played more than 64 games in a season with the Heat -- was a factor in what they'd be willing to commit to him.\n\nFrom there, he addressed Butler's comments the Heat would've beaten Boston and New York with him, and did not mince words about his star's bloviating.\n\nSo, does all of that mean Butler will be considered for a trade?\n\nAt least, not for now. Butler's response to all of this will be fascinating. He's long talked about loving the culture in Miami, but now that tough love(?) is being directed at him. He has never been shy about applying pressure to an organization to do what he wants, and if extension talks go nowhere, we'll have to see if he goes into his old playbook to try and force his way out. The difference this time is, he might be going up against the one front office chief more stubborn than he is, and a Riley vs. Butler battle has the potential to get very messy.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jimmy-butler.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

After the first-round series, he called out both Boston and the New York Knicks during an interview with Rock The Bells.\n\n\"If I was playing, Boston would be at home. New York damn sure would be (expletive) at home,\" he said.\n\nAsked about Butler's remarks on Monday, Riley made it clear he wasn't amused.\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling, or is that Jimmy serious?'\" Riley said during his end-of-season press conference. \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nButler's bold post-series comments may have been the straw that broke the camel's back. The six-time All-Star trash-talked the Celtics throughout the series despite not playing a single minute. He trolled Boston with a social media post after Miami's Game 2 win and guaranteed a victory during Game 3, which the C's won handily.\n\nIt's understandable that Butler is supremely confident in his ability to carry his team through the playoffs.

While he waited for his turn to get back on the court, the Heat guard kept the entertainment going for fans with his social media antics. Even when his team ended up losing to the Celtics in round one, that didn't stop him from talking trash about other teams. It seems like his fun time is over as Pat Riley recently issued a stern warning to his player.\n\nThe 34-year-old first trolled the Celtics when his team won their first game of the first-round series. He photoshopped his face on Jaylen Brown's body and referenced his quote, \"Don't let us get one\" from last year's postseason to mock the Celtics star.\n\nFor this, he went viral on the internet among fans who loved the witty side of him. But when the team got kicked out, Butler doubled down on the respect towards his competition, but it backfired and ticked people off.\n\nIn a clip uploaded by 'Ahn Fire Digital', Butler was heard saying, \"If I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would be at home. Josh Hart? C'mon man.\" The fans believed that this time he took it too far and ridiculed him for being immature.\n\nNow, even the Heat president has offered a blunt assessment of his behavior. Riley said,\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling, or is that Jimmy serious'... If you're not on the court playing, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nIt's not that taking digs isn't allowed in the NBA, but it is usually during a game. On top of it, the Heat was defeated by the same Celtics he's trying to belittle. Now if such a warning came from his camp, imagine the onslaught the opposition has to offer.\n\nButler was criticized for being immature by many, including the biggest name in his camp. Moreover, fans did not take it easy, and neither did the Knicks head coach. Tom Thibodeau was also asked about Butler's over-confidence.\n\nAccording to Stefan Bondy, he initially failed to recognize who Butler is, after that, Thibodeau said, \"I don't know him. But I'll beat him to a pulp\" with a smile on his face. This should be a lesson for him that when people put in the hard work every day, they don't expect to be belittled by someone who isn't even competing.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Thibodeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Thibodeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/5f4640f9-untitled-design-2024-05-07t011059.388.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Oregon did. We are left with a situation in which the Trojans don't seem to have enough high-level defensive linemen after a brutal 2023 season in which their defense didn't measure up. It's true that Lincoln Riley has dramatically upgraded the defensive coaching staff, but USC doesn't appear to have enough dudes to compete at the very highest levels of the Big Ten.\n\nRiley might have made appropriate staffing adjustments, but the residue of last year's failed 8-5 season likely contributed to Harmon choosing Oregon over USC. The Ducks are closer to a national title than the Trojans are. Harmon's decision can be seen as rational in that context.\n\nAll of this puts more heat on Riley. USC football analyst Josh Webb reminded everyone about Riley's pronounced limitations when writing this:\n\n\"If you were to take a look at total defense stats for the years Riley has been a head coach and average them out, you'd get a team that's consistently 81st in the nation in total defense. What about that screams elite? Then there's the fact that in the last two years, he's averaging 110th in the nation, so that aspect of the team is going in the wrong direction as well. All of this is without going into splits or different aspects like the run game, run game defense, sacks allowed, sacks gained, or anything of that nature. It gets worse.\n\n\"Is Lincoln Riley really that much better than any other Air Raid coach? Have we been caught up in the idea of Riley being successful those first couple of years (at Oklahoma) and then applied that to years in which his teams look outclassed and outcoached?

Butler, 34, appeared in 60 regular-season games, then missing one game in the play-in round and all five games of the Heat's 4-1 first-round playoff elimination at the hands of the Boston Celtics.\n\n\"Jimmy missed 22 games this past year, a mix of personal reasons and injury,\" Lee said. \"If there was a game that was on the schedule that Jimmy was healthy enough to participate in, he did that. He played in a number of back-to-backs and it was the utmost priority to him to do everything he can to be available.\n\n\"When you dive into even more, Jimmy played his highest minutes per game (34.0) since Minnesota (36.1 in 2018-19). He played over 2,000, the third year in a row that he's done that (actually 1,931 in 2021-22). He was third on the team in total minutes played (this past season).\n\n\"If you look at Jimmy's entire career, I'm not really sure where this narrative is coming from, in terms of constantly dissecting his availability. But if you look at his five years in Miami, the Miami Heat have participated in 61 playoff games, not including these past playoffs that he was injured for. Of those 61, Jimmy has only missed three because of injury. In every single playoff series since he's been in Miami, he's led the team in both minutes per game and total minutes.\n\n\"He's done that for five straight years. Last year, alone, in the run to the Finals, he played almost 900 minutes in the playoffs (874), essentially like half what he and the majority of players play 2,000 (in the regular season). He played half of that in the course of four series.\"\n\nLee stressed such wear should also be factored into the discussion of availability.\n\n\"He's worked extremely hard to both help the team build to having success over the course of a season, and then, most importantly for all of us, adding a high degree of success in the playoffs and making himself available as need be,\" Lee said.\n\n\"And when his number is called, more often than not, he's been able to answer the task. So I don't agree with that. It's something I would like to make sure there's a little bit more clarity on.\"\n\nLee also pointed out Butler was one of 12 players 33 or older to play at least 2,000 minutes.\n\nLee confirmed, as Riley said, that there was the conversation with the team prior to the season about availability.\n\n\"The thought that Jimmy is picking and choosing when to play isn't reality,\" Lee said. \"I enjoy watching him play as much, if not more, than anyone. So believe me, I want to see him play every night.\n\n\"But unfortunately he isn't a robot and injuries and circumstances happen. Prior to the year, we had a meeting to discuss the changing NBA rules and the need to reject load management, And we all understood the assignment. Jimmy's 22 games missed were all for valid issues and concerns.\"\n\nThrough it all, Lee said Butler remains committed to the Heat and South Florida.\n\n\"Once he got to this organization, he got to an organization that wholeheartedly has embraced him in every single way,\" Lee said. \"Look, they're both cut from the same cloth.\n\n\"There's going to be honest conversations that have to be had this summer about how to move forward, but those conversations aren't going to be driven by anything other than, 'How do we do this to move forward to take the next step, and win a championship?' \"\n\nAs for an extension window for Butler opening on July 7, Lee said, \"I have too much respect for both what Jimmy's accomplished in his career and what he's built to negotiate publicly. I have way too much respect for the franchise that currently employs him to be doing that. So we're going to go away, we're going to do our business, and that's whatever it's going to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ira_winderman@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Ira Winderman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaseya_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaseya Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of South Florida"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fl-sp-miami-heat-jimmy-butler1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-07", "textStart": 4411, "textEnd": 4417}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

There was a question about Jimmy Butler in the Miami Heat president's annual postseason talk Monday -- another question about Jimmy Butler, that is.\n\nThis entire Heat offseason will be one question about Butler's future followed by one about his attitude followed by another of contract extension and yet another of his trade value. This question was about Butler's words.\n\nButler did an interview after the Heat were trounced without him in the series by Boston and said: \"If I was playing, Boston would be at home. New York for damn sure would be\" home. Riley was asked simply if the Heat would have won with Butler on the court.\n\nThat hypothetical wasn't the issue as the Riley saw it. Being a pro was the issue.\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy being serious?' \" Riley said. \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston, or playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nYes, shots were fired Monday by Riley in his annual, postseason State of the Heat talk. You bet they were. This is how you know there's leadership and standards inside a business. This is what separates the Heat from most sports organizations, too: Riley has the championship rings to back up his thoughts.\n\nHe was asked, for instance, about the pressure most teams feel in signing a player like Butler to a extension when he's eligible, as Butler is in July. The extension would turn the remaining two-year, 110-millionon Butler's deal into a three-year, $160 million contract.\n\n\"There's no pressure,'' Riley said. \"The last extension, we gave it to him.\"\n\nHe said that it's a \"big decision\" for any franchise, \"unless you have someone who is going to be there, available, every single night.\"\n\nDo you see the issue here? Heat Culture is about playing the regular season hard. Jimmy hasn't played more than 64 games in the regular season his five Heat years. He played 60 this past season. He needed a break three games into the season. He watched tennis for eight hours one day and called in sick the next.\n\nThe Heat's top core of Butler, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro played just 19 games together. The Heat finished eighth in the East -- four games behind the second-place Knicks. See why this matters? See why the play-in game and opening series against Boston was avoidable?\n\nThe central question: Will Butler change? It's not just that he's 35 next season. It's that from his view he's led the Heat to the NBA Finals twice and conference finals three times in his five years. All might look good to him.\n\nSo, the instant option is a trade, though Riley echoed coach Erik Spoelstra in saying that wasn't going to happen. Maybe it doesn't considering the investment a team would have to make in Butler as time starts to take a toll. Or maybe they're just saying what they have to say to not crush any trade value.\n\nButler, of course, isn't the only NBA player to say the regular season is meaningless. Shaquille O'Neal did so back when he played with the Heat.\n\nRiley, of course, famously challenged O'Neal to a fight at a practice. That's part of why the Heat likes to say, \"We're not for everyone.\" Riley also famously called out LeBron James in this same postseason after the 2014-15 season about how, \"this stuff is hard,\" and to \"stay if he has the guts.\"\n\nLeBron didn't like that. Jimmy won't like this. It's a clash of eras in some form, as Riley doesn't understand things like the 65-game rule the NBA passed as a minimum to make player eligible for postseason awards. That gives them an excuse not to play 17 games, he feels.\n\nRiley was asked if he'll talk to Butler about playing more games\n\n\"That was discussed prior to last year,'' he said. \"We had a discussion with his agent about that. That was discussed thoroughly.\"\n\nSomething didn't translate.\n\nThis will end where it has to with the Heat trying to trade Butler. Don't read that wrong. They aren't going to tank-for-tomorrow like the Dolphins did. They won't do like the Marlins and trade players at the start of a season to build their minor leagues.\n\n\"Our organization is not about rebuilding,'' Riley said. \"I'll never use that word. We retool as needed to try to make it better.\"\n\nThey'll retool this offseason. Riley told of meeting LeBron for his postseason interview after their first season together that ended with a loss in the Finals. LeBron, remember, collapsed in the final games against Dallas. There's no other way to put it.\n\nLeBron interrupted Riley's meeting with Chris Bosh that ran late. He and Riley stared at each other.

There was a question about Jimmy Butler in the Miami Heat president's annual postseason talk Monday -- another question about Jimmy Butler, that is.\n\nThis entire Heat offseason will be one question about Butler's future followed by one about his attitude followed by another of contract extension and yet another of his trade value. This question was about Butler's words.\n\nButler did an interview after the Heat were trounced without him in the series by Boston and said: \"If I was playing, Boston would be at home. New York for damn sure would be\" home. Riley was asked simply if the Heat would have won with Butler on the court.\n\nThat hypothetical wasn't the issue as the Riley saw it. Being a pro was the issue.\n\n\"For him to say that, I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy being serious?' \" Riley said. \"If you're not on the court playing against Boston, or playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut.\"\n\nYes, shots were fired Monday by Riley in his annual, postseason State of the Heat talk. You bet they were. This is how you know there's leadership and standards inside a business. This is what separates the Heat from most sports organizations, too: Riley has the championship rings to back up his thoughts.\n\nHe was asked, for instance, about the pressure most teams feel in signing a player like Butler to a extension when he's eligible, as Butler is in July. The extension would turn the remaining two-year, 110-millionon Butler's deal into a three-year, $160 million contract.\n\n\"There's no pressure,'' Riley said. \"The last extension, we gave it to him.\"\n\nHe said that it's a \"big decision\" for any franchise, \"unless you have someone who is going to be there, available, every single night.\"\n\nDo you see the issue here? Heat Culture is about playing the regular season hard. Jimmy hasn't played more than 64 games in the regular season his five Heat years. He played 60 this past season. He needed a break three games into the season. He watched tennis for eight hours one day and called in sick the next.\n\nThe Heat's top core of Butler, Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro played just 19 games together. The Heat finished eighth in the East -- four games behind the second-place Knicks. See why this matters? See why the play-in game and opening series against Boston was avoidable?\n\nThe central question: Will Butler change? It's not just that he's 35 next season. It's that from his view he's led the Heat to the NBA Finals twice and conference finals three times in his five years. All might look good to him.\n\nSo, the instant option is a trade, though Riley echoed coach Erik Spoelstra in saying that wasn't going to happen. Maybe it doesn't considering the investment a team would have to make in Butler as time starts to take a toll. Or maybe they're just saying what they have to say to not crush any trade value.\n\nButler, of course, isn't the only NBA player to say the regular season is meaningless. Shaquille O'Neal did so back when he played with the Heat.\n\nRiley, of course, famously challenged O'Neal to a fight at a practice. That's part of why the Heat likes to say, \"We're not for everyone.\" Riley also famously called out LeBron James in this same postseason after the 2014-15 season about how, \"this stuff is hard,\" and to \"stay if he has the guts.\"\n\nLeBron didn't like that. Jimmy won't like this. It's a clash of eras in some form, as Riley doesn't understand things like the 65-game rule the NBA passed as a minimum to make player eligible for postseason awards. That gives them an excuse not to play 17 games, he feels.\n\nRiley was asked if he'll talk to Butler about playing more games\n\n\"That was discussed prior to last year,'' he said. \"We had a discussion with his agent about that. That was discussed thoroughly.\"\n\nSomething didn't translate.\n\nThis will end where it has to with the Heat trying to trade Butler. Don't read that wrong. They aren't going to tank-for-tomorrow like the Dolphins did. They won't do like the Marlins and trade players at the start of a season to build their minor leagues.\n\n\"Our organization is not about rebuilding,'' Riley said. \"I'll never use that word. We retool as needed to try to make it better.\"\n\nThey'll retool this offseason. Riley told of meeting LeBron for his postseason interview after their first season together that ended with a loss in the Finals. LeBron, remember, collapsed in the final games against Dallas. There's no other way to put it.\n\nLeBron interrupted Riley's meeting with Chris Bosh that ran late. He and Riley stared at each other. Finally, Riley said, \"I have to go to work on the roster to make it deeper.\"\n\nHe needs to do that now. Spoelstra needs to make a bottom-third offense score more. But the main thing is Butler. Will he change? Can he play more? At 35, 36 and 37, will he still be a postseason force?\n\nOne thing for sure is Riley, as strong leaders do, gave him some thing to think about: Shut up and shape up.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_hyde@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Dave Hyde", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bosh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tfl-l-riley-presser-07-050624.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 452724741, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 49, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 49}}}

They were like, 'no, not him.'

That's taking nothing away from what Tyler does as a basketball player. But for our chemistry, we are better when we got Duncan Robinson in the starting lineup, making plays, being that trigger for us and spraying and creating for other guys.\"\n\nRiley made clear he doesn't agree with Haslem's opinion on the matter.\n\n\"That's a narrative that's out there,\" Riley said. \"Everybody who has that narrative must know more than I know to say that about Tyler... Tyler is a starter. Is that going to be something you are going to ask a player one day, whether it's he or Terry Rozier one day.\n\n\"That's where a coach has a job to do, what he's paid for. Whatever is in the best interests of the team. We won't know until we have everybody available, how the whole thing works\" with Herro and Rozier.\n\nRiley said he told Haslem he \"he probably should have kept that [opinion] to himself. We have one voice and that voice is all of our voice. But one guy is going to distribute that information and that's Erik [Spoelstra]. If I'm talking to the media every week, there's going to be controversy. Spo and I argue a lot, but I don't want to put that in the media.\n\n\"What Udonis has to understand is he works for the Heat. I think he's really good on NBA TV or ESPN on the studio show, and he and Mike Miller are funny as hell on their podcast. Half the stories are ... embellished, especially about me.\"\n\nRiley offered some insight on the neck injury that sidelined Rozier the final nine games of the season, including the playoffs, without revealing the precise diagnosis.\n\n\"I see him with a neck brace on,\" said Riley, who met with Rozier last week. \"He said he feels good. He's doing everything he's [supposed to]. \"It's a process; it takes time.\n\n\"He gets hit and hits the floor hard. When you're dealing with a spine, you don't mess around. You're not going to mess around with it. He wanted to play desperately. He couldn't. It's going to heal. Doctors convinced us and him that in time this thing will heal and go away.\"\n\nAs a player, \"Terry was everything I expected,\" Riley said.\n\n\u25aa Riley said of Spoelstra's contract extension (reportedly for eight years and $120 million): \"He deserves it.... He could have been a free agent and gone anywhere. That leads to organizational stability with your players.\n\n\"Word gets around about these coaches. Players who come to him and his staff and develop. Other players see that. All of a sudden, they have career contracts and career opportunities.

But for our chemistry, we are better when we got Duncan Robinson in the starting lineup, making plays, being that trigger for us and spraying and creating for other guys.\"\n\nRiley made clear he doesn't agree with Haslem's opinion on the matter.\n\n\"That's a narrative that's out there,\" Riley said. \"Everybody who has that narrative must know more than I know to say that about Tyler... Tyler is a starter. Is that going to be something you are going to ask a player one day, whether it's he or Terry Rozier one day.\n\n\"That's where a coach has a job to do, what he's paid for. Whatever is in the best interests of the team. We won't know until we have everybody available, how the whole thing works\" with Herro and Rozier.\n\nRiley said he told Haslem he \"he probably should have kept that [opinion] to himself. We have one voice and that voice is all of our voice. But one guy is going to distribute that information and that's Erik [Spoelstra]. If I'm talking to the media every week, there's going to be controversy. Spo and I argue a lot, but I don't want to put that in the media.\n\n\"What Udonis has to understand is he works for the Heat. I think he's really good on NBA TV or ESPN on the studio show, and he and Mike Miller are funny as hell on their podcast. Half the stories are ... embellished, especially about me.\"\n\nRiley offered some insight on the neck injury that sidelined Rozier the final nine games of the season, including the playoffs, without revealing the precise diagnosis.\n\n\"I see him with a neck brace on,\" said Riley, who met with Rozier last week. \"He said he feels good. He's doing everything he's [supposed to]. \"It's a process; it takes time.\n\n\"He gets hit and hits the floor hard. When you're dealing with a spine, you don't mess around. You're not going to mess around with it. He wanted to play desperately. He couldn't. It's going to heal. Doctors convinced us and him that in time this thing will heal and go away.\"\n\nAs a player, \"Terry was everything I expected,\" Riley said.\n\n\u25aa Riley said of Spoelstra's contract extension (reportedly for eight years and $120 million): \"He deserves it.... He could have been a free agent and gone anywhere. That leads to organizational stability with your players.\n\n\"Word gets around about these coaches. Players who come to him and his staff and develop. Other players see that. All of a sudden, they have career contracts and career opportunities. It's a credit to him.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udonis_Haslem", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Udonis Haslem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Worthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sixth man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Robinson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Robinson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Miller_(basketball,_born_1980)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Miller (basketball, born 1980)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/miami_herald_mcclatchy_975/e6e4ccfe26fcedee5e74fa3dfcd84c59", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 452725027, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 51, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 51}}}

We don't have to do it until 2025, actually. But we'll see. We haven't made a decision on it, and we haven't really in earnest discussed it.\"\n\nThere are a number of factors the Heat will consider -- Butler's playing time among them. He is, without question, an elite player whose time in Miami has been loaded with some signature performances, especially in the playoffs. But he turns 35 in September and has missed 100 regular-season games in his five Miami seasons, sitting out for injuries, rest or other reasons nearly 26% of the time.\n\nHe suffered a knee injury during the play-in tournament this season and missed Miami's Round 1 playoff loss to Boston.\n\n\"That's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who's going to be there and available every single night,\" Riley said. \"That's the truth.\"\n\nRiley spoke for about 40 minutes, with many of his remarks surrounding Butler, and he lauded Miami's highest-paid player multiple times -- even saying he \"moves the needle the most\" and that he's \"an incredible player.\" The Heat have 268 total wins in Butler's five seasons, fifth-most in the NBA over that span, and have made two NBA Finals appearances.\n\nBut he also didn't shy away from doling out criticism. Butler, speaking this past weekend at a Formula 1 race in Miami Gardens, said \"if I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would ... be at home.\"\n\nRiley didn't seem to like that much. \"I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious?' If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut on the criticism of those teams,\" Riley said.\n\nThe player availability issue goes well beyond just Butler. Miami used a franchise-record 37 different starting lineups in 89 games this season, including the two play-in contests. It had 18 different players make at least one start, largely because the lineup of available players seemed to always be changing from one night to the next.\n\nTyler Herro missed 40 games in the regular season, while Butler missed 22. Injuries dogged Miami all season long and only two players -- rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. (75) and captain Bam Adebayo (71) -- made more than 70 appearances for the Heat in the regular season. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last week that the team will take \"a deep dive\" into the reasons why players miss so much time, and Riley echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"We've got a really good group of guys and the No. 1 issue is player availability and having your guys healthy to play every night,\" Riley said. \"And we have to wrap our arms around that notion.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old Riley just completed his 29th season with the Heat, all of that as president and some of it as coach before giving that position up twice -- once in 2003 to Stan Van Gundy before taking back over in 2005 when Van Gundy stepped down, then for good in 2008 when Spoelstra was promoted.\n\nIn those 29 Miami seasons, the Heat have the second-best regular-season winning percentage in the NBA (.569) behind only San Antonio (.628). Only the Spurs (175) and the Los Angeles Lakers (165) have more playoff wins in that span that Miami does (161).\n\nThe Riley record is basically beyond compare. In his 42 seasons as a head coach and/or executive, his teams -- the Lakers, New York and Heat -- have combined for 2,372 wins, including postseason. No single NBA franchise has more wins in those 42 seasons than Riley has accumulated during his stints with those three clubs.\n\nHe'll tweak things. But he's not changing his ways.\n\n\"Until you change the way you go about doing the things that are necessary to win, whatever they are, those things you're doing to try to win, if they aren't working, let's change,\" Riley said. \"And so, that doesn't mean that change is a sinister word here. ...

We don't have to do it until 2025, actually. But we'll see. We haven't made a decision on it, and we haven't really in earnest discussed it.\"\n\nThere are a number of factors the Heat will consider -- Butler's playing time among them. He is, without question, an elite player whose time in Miami has been loaded with some signature performances, especially in the playoffs. But he turns 35 in September and has missed 100 regular-season games in his five Miami seasons, sitting out for injuries, rest or other reasons nearly 26% of the time.\n\nHe suffered a knee injury during the play-in tournament this season and missed Miami's Round 1 playoff loss to Boston.\n\n\"That's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who's going to be there and available every single night,\" Riley said. \"That's the truth.\"\n\nRiley spoke for about 40 minutes, with many of his remarks surrounding Butler, and he lauded Miami's highest-paid player multiple times -- even saying he \"moves the needle the most\" and that he's \"an incredible player.\" The Heat have 268 total wins in Butler's five seasons, fifth-most in the NBA over that span, and have made two NBA Finals appearances.\n\nBut he also didn't shy away from doling out criticism. Butler, speaking this past weekend at a Formula 1 race in Miami Gardens, said \"if I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would ... be at home.\"\n\nRiley didn't seem to like that much. \"I thought, 'Is that Jimmy trolling or is that Jimmy serious?' If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut on the criticism of those teams,\" Riley said.\n\nThe player availability issue goes well beyond just Butler. Miami used a franchise-record 37 different starting lineups in 89 games this season, including the two play-in contests. It had 18 different players make at least one start, largely because the lineup of available players seemed to always be changing from one night to the next.\n\nTyler Herro missed 40 games in the regular season, while Butler missed 22. Injuries dogged Miami all season long and only two players -- rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. (75) and captain Bam Adebayo (71) -- made more than 70 appearances for the Heat in the regular season. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said last week that the team will take \"a deep dive\" into the reasons why players miss so much time, and Riley echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"We've got a really good group of guys and the No. 1 issue is player availability and having your guys healthy to play every night,\" Riley said. \"And we have to wrap our arms around that notion.\"\n\nThe 79-year-old Riley just completed his 29th season with the Heat, all of that as president and some of it as coach before giving that position up twice -- once in 2003 to Stan Van Gundy before taking back over in 2005 when Van Gundy stepped down, then for good in 2008 when Spoelstra was promoted.\n\nIn those 29 Miami seasons, the Heat have the second-best regular-season winning percentage in the NBA (.569) behind only San Antonio (.628). Only the Spurs (175) and the Los Angeles Lakers (165) have more playoff wins in that span that Miami does (161).\n\nThe Riley record is basically beyond compare. In his 42 seasons as a head coach and/or executive, his teams -- the Lakers, New York and Heat -- have combined for 2,372 wins, including postseason. No single NBA franchise has more wins in those 42 seasons than Riley has accumulated during his stints with those three clubs.\n\nHe'll tweak things. But he's not changing his ways.\n\n\"Until you change the way you go about doing the things that are necessary to win, whatever they are, those things you're doing to try to win, if they aren't working, let's change,\" Riley said. \"And so, that doesn't mean that change is a sinister word here. ...

This past weekend, at the F1 Grand Prix in Miami, Butler said on Instagram, \"If I was playing, Boston would be at home, New York damn sure would... be at home.\" Riley was not a fan.\n\n\"If you're not on the court playing against Boston or on the court playing against the New York Knicks, you should keep your mouth shut on the criticism of those teams,\" Riley said.\n\nThe Heat are expected to go big game hunting for another star this summer, but Butler could make things even hotter if he doesn't get the contract he wants.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Herro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Herro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Rozier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry Rozier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bam_Adebayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bam Adebayo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1801035/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F590%2F707%2Fnbc_bfa_jimmybutler_240506.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543636", "eventUri": "eng-9543636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 452726809, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 56, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 56}}}

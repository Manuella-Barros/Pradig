Yet, after Mackenzie saw how the peahen peacefully made her way to a corner table and perched on top of it next to a pint, she felt comfortable enough to approach the bird and name her Marjory. \u201cShe seemed pretty easy going,\u201d Mackenzie smile. \u201cShe just wanted to relax with a beer.\u201d Animal control said the peahen would move along soon if she wasn\u2019t fed. Although she wasn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t. Marjory stayed and impressed the staff and patrons for three days. \u201cShe brought a lot of joy,\u201d Mackenzie smiles. But rather than delivering the punchline to a joke, after popping up in social media posts all over the area, Marjory seems to be acting more like that wandering dog from the old TV show \u201cThe Littlest Hobo.\u201d The theme song includes the lyric, \u201cEvery stop I make, I make a new friend.\u201d Jessica Mollins and her family formed a feathered friendship after the peahen showed up at their house. \u201cMy neighbour message me, and she\u2019s like, \u2018You have a peacock in your front yard,\u2019\u201d Jessica recalls with a smile. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018What?!\u2019\u201d When Jessica opened the front door, Marjory was looking up at her, seemingly saying, \u201cWelcome to the neighbourhood.\u201d \u201cWe just moved here from Halifax,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cI just started talking to her.\u201d Perhaps it was Jessica\u2019s warm welcome that prompted the peahen to spend almost 20 days around the house, befriending a trio young deer, a pair of ducks, and one indifferent family dog. \u201cMy neighbour says she hasn\u2019t seen anything like this in the 12 years she\u2019s lived here,\u201d Jessica says. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018(The peahen) had a connection with you.\u2019\u201d Or maybe the peahen\u2019s on a mission \u2014 sensing how Jessica\u2019s boys were missing their old house, the bird was staying to inspire enough smiles to make this new house finally feel like home. \u201cIt was pretty cool,\u201d Jessica smiles. It\u2019s like the bird didn\u2019t bid adieu to the pub until Mackenzie\u2019s fear was transformed into favour. \u201cI felt like she was an old soul,\u201d Mackenzie says of the peahen, adding that she seemed like an elegant old patron of the pub who returned to appreciate a pint with her pals. \u201cShe\u2019s very majestic. She\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely left a little place in our hearts.\u201d The pub staff are even talking about making a peahen-inspired beer, with an image of Marjory on the label. And like \u201cThe Littlest Hobo\u201d theme song lyrics, maybe tomorrow she will want to settle down, but until tomorrow Marjory will just keep moving on.", "summary": "When Sarah Karagianis received multiple notifications from her staff about a situation at work, she feared the worst.", "url": "https://bc.ctvnews.ca/roaming-peahen-spends-3-days-in-b-c-pub-after-befriending-neighbourhood-family-1.6918821", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/7/peahen-1-6918834-1717808984047.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:58:33", "author": "Adam Sawatsky", "authors": ["Adam Sawatsky"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.046}

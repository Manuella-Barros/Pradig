Senior captain Kyle DiLiddo returns at tight end.\n\n\"Liam is an unbelievable athlete,'' said DiLiddo. \"I know that if I get open he's going to hit me, and I need to do my job and catch the ball.''\n\nSeniors Jared Frost (guard) and Brendan Gardner will anchor the East Bridgewater offensive line.\n\n\"Ben Ross got a lot of carries in the Super Bowl because of injuries,'' said Tarpey. \"Jared, who was one of our best linemen last year, and Brendan started for us last year and we will be looking at them to lead our offensive line play.''\n\nOn the defensive side, DiLiddo returns at defensive end and Donahue at linebacker.\n\n\"One thing we hang our hat on here at East Bridgewater is that we're going to play tough,'' said Tarpey. \"I don't know what the score is going to be, but I know when the game is over, people are going say those guys are tough. We're going to play tough on defense and run the ball right at you on offense.''\n\nEast Bridgewater will look to defend its South Shore League Sullivan Division title, but it won't be easy against Middleboro, Rockland and Norwell, a team that EB beat in last year's South Sectional final.\n\n\"We play in a South Shore League that is excellent in football,'' Tarpey said. \"We have high expectations, which is great. When I first started here, we were scratching and clawing just to win games and now we're looking to win the league title every year.\n\n\"Besides playing at Gillette that last two years and having that experience is incredible, this senior class has played more games than anyone else and that alone should help those guys forge their own identity and have them lead the way for us.''", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:53:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.9333333373069763, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375042", "time": "03:53:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375042", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209384", "label": {"eng": "East Bridgewater"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bridgewater,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Bridgewater"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 2}, {"id": "310219", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "333558", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Gillette Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillette_Stadium", "score": 3}, {"id": "611172", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Interscholastic_Athletic_Association", "score": 2}, {"id": "790364", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "East Bridgewater High School"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bridgewater_High_School", "score": 3}], "image": "http://www.enterprisenews.com/storyimage/WL/20170819/SPORTS/170817158/AR/0/AR-170817158.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:53:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "H.S.

Here we go again.''\n\nColombo and his staff welcomed almost 100 candidates to Marciano Stadium for practice, while starting the task of evaluating candidates to make some decisions.\n\n\"We can't coach that many,'' Colombo said of the large turnout. \"We'll have to decide and make decisions. With the new schedule that is in place, we have more time to watch and evaluate players before our first scrimmage next week (Aug. 26). We used to have just Thursday and Friday to get ready for our scrimmage with St. John's of Shrewsbury, but now we have Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to be ready to go after the conditioning.\n\n\"I like the rules for preseason practicing in place because in Massachusetts we start behind the rest of the country by a couple of weeks. It gives us time to evaluate and get into pads.\"\n\nIn East Bridgewater, coach Shawn Tarpey and his defending Division 3A Super Bowl champions kicked off their season under rules that the veteran coach likes.\n\n\"It's better for the kids,'' said Tarpey. \"Your summer gets cut short with the family from a personal standpoint, but it's a better transition for the kids and I feel much better as a coach getting them into full pads a little later. Having that scrimmage on that first Saturday is always a challenge to get them prepared and this gives us a little more time.''\n\nTarpey is hoping to use the two extra days he has with his team to teach and learn.\n\n\"We don't do a lot of hitting in the preseason, as that is something we have scaled back on years ago,'' Tarpey said. \"We found that the product is much better for our kids. High school football is so tough to try and get everything in that you want before that first game. This extra time we have allows more teaching time for us as a staff.\n\n\"It's great to be back on the field as a team. I'm so excited for our senior group as they have been waiting their whole life to play their last season for East Bridgewater and you have that feeling that you get on Christmas today being out here.''", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T23:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1250, "textStart": 1243, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.658823549747467, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375042", "time": "23:16:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375042", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "50988", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "209310", "label": {"eng": "Brockton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brockton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brockton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "209384", "label": {"eng": "East Bridgewater"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bridgewater,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Bridgewater"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "242094", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "308958", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Butterfly"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly", "score": 3}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 2}, {"id": "310219", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "score": 1}, {"id": "320752", "label": {"eng": "Shrewsbury"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrewsbury", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "327832", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "High school football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "score": 3}, {"id": "611172", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Interscholastic_Athletic_Association", "score": 5}], "image": "http://www.enterprisenews.com/storyimage/WL/20170818/SPORTS/170817237/AR/0/AR-170817237.jpg", "timeCrawl": "23:16:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "H.S.

His squad defeated St. Mary's of Lynn, 34-8, in the Division 3A state championship game at Gillette Stadium last fall.\n\nEven with a state championship under his belt, Tarpey is ready to move on to the start of another season.\n\n\"Whenever you finish on a winning note ... it just adds another level of excitement,\" Tarpey said. \"(I'm excited to see) what this 2017 squad will be able to do.\"\n\nThe title defense will be challenging. Reliable contributors Greg Plunkett, Mike and Nick Khoury and Pat Snow have graduated.\n\n\"It's going to be impossible to replace them,\" Tarpey said. \"Specifically, what last year taught me is how each team is going to gel. ... It leads into this year and what are we going to have.\"\n\nA few miles down the road, Abington head coach Jim Kelliher is preparing for his 44th season at the helm of the Green Wave.\n\n\"It is (exciting), whether it's myself as a football coach (or a player),\" Kelliher said. \"Football is always a little different because kids haven't been around compared to the winter season.\"\n\nKelliher said it's important to let the players get back into the swing of things and not go too hard too early.\n\n\"You have to take it easy, work yourself (to get) your body acclimated into the physical regimen.\n\n\"Certainly we've had changes at the MIAA level (in terms of preparing for the season), which is fine,\" Kelliher said. \"We work through those. The biggest thing is getting their body regulated to football.\"\n\nMeanwhile, 11-year assistant coach Nick Liquori has moved up to the head coaching job at Rockland.\n\n\"I'm thrilled with the opportunity. Learning the different facets of the game under Brian Kelliher and Ken Owen was beneficial,\" said Liquori, referring to the two head coaches for whom he worked as an assistant.\n\nLiquori is eager to get his program underway.\n\n\"Kids have worked hard this summer putting time in the weight room,\" Liquori said. \"It's good to get back in the grind.\"\n\nA hot-button football topic, particularly at the high school and youth levels, is how concussion risks affect the number of athletes participating.\n\n\"In recent years, our numbers are down\" - about seven or eight kids, Tarpey said. \"We still have freshman, J.V. (and varsity programs).\"\n\nKelliher and Liquori echoed Tarpey's assessment.\n\n\"I don't think we've had (much of a drop-off),\" Kelliher said. \"We have (around 40 kids) scheduled for practice at the varsity level.\n\n\"If it could stay like that I'd be happy. ... It's a pretty significant number for us.\"\n\nSaid Liquori: \"I haven't necessarily seen (the drop-off) in terms of concussions just yet.

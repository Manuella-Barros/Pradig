Because the Los Angeles Football Club midfielder watched from the sidelines for the past three months while recovering from a stress fracture in his lower back \u2013 an ailment he brought with him to L.A, that worsened after playing too many games without resting or listening to his body \u2013 one of South America\u2019s most sought-after prospects was forced to miss the competition. Had he been healthy, the 18-year-old Mart\u00ednez thinks that instead of seeing the 1-0 result on television like he did Wednesday, he would have been able to join his Venezuela teammates in their red wine jerseys as they try to win the competition for the first time. In the spring, when his back became so bothersome that he had to address it, the lingering injury only added to the mix of circumstances Mart\u00ednez had to sort through after choosing to leave his country, culture and family for the first time to become a professional soccer player in L.A. \u201cTruthfully it\u2019s been a challenge,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, who has contributed a goal and an assist for LAFC in a little more than 90 minutes of game action. While he was out, the talented youngster engaged with his teammates, showing his sense of humor and personality while honing his ability in the gym to set himself up to avoid these sorts of incidents going forward. For LAFC head coach Steve Cherundolo, Mart\u00ednez \u201cused the time well and we have also used the time well to integrate him into Los Angeles and LAFC without the complications of training and playing.\u201d In no hurry to push the native of El Tigre, Venezuela, Cherundolo suggested that \u201cit will be a while before we see the best David Mart\u00ednez.\u201d During his last appearance against Colorado on March 30, Mart\u00ednez flashed that tremendous ability by splitting defenders in the box and hitting a low curler with his left foot to score his first MLS goal. \u201cYou can tell already at his age he has something special,\u201d defender Ryan Hollingshead said. \u201cHe has something with vision, the way he sees the game, something about his understanding of football that\u2019s different.\u201d His goal briefly lifted LAFC into the lead heading into the last 15 minutes of the match outside Denver, but Mart\u00ednez picked up a silly second yellow card by kicking the ball away after a foul he committed. A short time later Colorado (9-7-4, 31 points) capitalized on the man-advantage to snatch a late victory. The Rapids have won three straight, outscoring opponents 9-1 ahead of the rematch with LAFC at BMO Stadium. Saturday night\u2019s match features a pair of teams in the top four in the Western Conference standings. While Mart\u00ednez sat, LAFC (11-4-4, 37 points) lost once in 15 games. The team currently hold a franchise record 10-match unbeaten streak. This sort of success didn\u2019t surprise the young Venezuelan \u2013 it\u2019s one of the main reasons he chose LAFC over other MLS and European offers when he signed a deal through 2027, with a team option for an additional year. For the first time since falling to the Rapids, Mart\u00ednez was among Cherundolo\u2019s available options last weekend. He didn\u2019t appear in LAFC\u2019s 6-2 romp over San Jose, but \u201cjust being back in the locker room made me happy to contribute my part.\u201d COLORADO RAPIDS AT LAFC When: Saturday, 7:30 p.m. Where: BMO Stadium TV/Radio: Apple TV+ \u2013 MLS Season Pass/710 AM, 980 AM", "summary": "The 18-year-old Venezuelan midfielder says watching from the sidelines for the past three months while recovering from a stress fracture in his lower back has been \u201ca challenge.\u201d", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/28/david-martinez-eager-to-contribute-for-lafc/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24036842197716.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:07:24", "author": "Josh Gross", "authors": ["Josh Gross"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.06}

(Photo by Alex Pantling/Getty Images) Getty Images Long before kick-off in the game commonly branded the most valuable in world soccer one fact was well-established. Whether it was Southampton or Leeds United that eventually triumphed in the Championship Play-Off Final, and it was Saints who did, at least two of the representatives from the division in next season\u2019s Premier Premier League would be returning after just a year\u2019s absence. Although warnings about the growing disparity between the top division and the competition below have been sounding for at least a quarter of a century it is only in the post-Covid era that the chasm between the two leagues has started to definitively impact competitiveness. This year the growing trend became overwhelmingly pronounced. The three relegated clubs from the Premier League, Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton Town, are the same trio promoted the year before. That only two of their replacements are sides demoted the previous time around is only due to the miracle of Ipswich Town under Kieran McKenna which prevented it being a clean sweep. If the current trend continues the enthralling jeopardy of the relegation battle which has made the Premier League such a compelling competition will become obsolete and the Championship, renowned for its unpredictability, rendered a dull formality.

It is making it almost impossible for a Plymouth Argyle or Bristol City to think that they could someday compete in the Premier League. That is unless something changes. Hopes had been high that a new independent soccer regulator promised by Britain\u2019s Conservative government might deliver. However, last week a UK General Election was called by Primer Minister Rishi Sunak. The news that Britain will head to the polls on July 4 means that the proposed Football Governance Bill, which will create the regulator for English soccer will not have time to become law. Both the incumbent Prime Minister and rival Labour Party leader Kier Starmer support for the legislation so there is hope given the heavy lobbying of the English Football Association-which represents the Championship and the two divisions below-the motion will eventually pass. \u201cIt is certainly not the end of the process, however \u2014 far from it,\u201d said Rick Parry, the disappointed EFL chief executive. \u201cThe EFL, and others who support the bill, will be actively pushing for it to be reintroduced in the first session of the new parliament given the level of cross-party support for its introduction.\u201d However, if Labour does beat the Conservatives in the vote there is a chance of even more substantive change. Its shadow minister for sport has called for the body to make changes to the parachute payments-issued to relegated sides to soften the blow of demotion but which have seriously distorted the league below-to be addressed. The shadow minister for sport has called for the new governing body power to tackle the issue. But I would argue that we shouldn\u2019t place too much hope in regulation offering the solution to this mess because it is precisely the poorly designed introduction of such rules that is fuelling the disparity. Financial Fair Play: A Necessary Evil Or The Death Of Ambition? WIGAN - UNITED KINGDOM - FEBRUARY 23: Paul Scharner of Wigan Athletic celebrates his opener during ...

(Photo Tom Dulat/Getty Images) Getty Images Regulation in English soccer, compared to other sports at least, remained virtually non-existent until the late-2000s. Up until then as long as you had access to the cash, and in many cases the method for doing so caused serious problems later, there was no limit on investment or checks on overspending. The lack of regulation enabled clubs like Wigan Athletic and Bournemouth to elevate themselves from the lower reaches of the game to the top flight and fuelled Premier League title-winning success at Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea. But it also led to the near extinction of famous old clubs like Leeds United and Coventry City who spent beyond their means disastrously. The problem of overspending hurt the lower divisions as the wealth of the Premier League continued to increase. Clubs in the Championship started gambling on promotion by spending money they often did not have. However, as is so often the case, efforts to introduce regulations around spending gained momentum when they were driven by the powerful clubs rather than those pushed to the brink of extinction. It has been the established elite of the game who\u2019ve established Financial Fair Play rules designed, in theory, to keep teams in the black, but have the considerable added consequence of punishing those who might have the ability to sustainably speculate to progress. The result of this is a game where there are fewer administrations, an undeniably positive development, but also one in which existing financial disparities are entrenched. Clubs like Sheffield Wednesday or Derby County will increasingly find it almost impossible to achieve a higher standing than a team like Bournemouth who were fortunate enough to be in the Premier League when the intense disparity calcified. Unless there are some major changes take place for the foreseeable future those famous old clubs will only be able to look upwards at the Cherries, despite consistently having three times as many people watch them each week. Why is it Nottingham Forest and Everton who\u2019ve been punished most severely for financial fair play breaches so far? Because those were clubs that dared look upwards and acquire talent in a bid to challenge those above them. It is for those reasons we shouldn\u2019t look to more rules to solve English soccer\u2019s deteriorating competitiveness. The overwhelming evidence is that whilst a lack of regulation might have fuelled the disparity within English soccer it is the introduction of rules around finances that have increased and entrenched the gap. It has created a scenario that neither reflects the world of well-organised competitive business nor the beautiful meritocracy of a healthy sport. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

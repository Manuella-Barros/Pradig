Mette Frederiksen's office said in a statement on Saturday the prime minister had been rushed to a hospital for a check-up soon after the attack. She is otherwise fine apart from whiplash but had been left \"shaken\" by the assault, her office added. Police said a 39-year-old has been arrested. Details of what happened remain unclear but local media reported a man walked towards Ms Frederiksen and pushed her hard while she was passing Kultorvet Square, one of Copenhagen's main squares. Two eyewitnesses, Anna Ravn and Marie Adrian, told the daily Danish newspaper BT they saw a man walking toward Ms Frederiksen and then \"pushing her hard on the shoulder so she was shoved aside\". They stressed that the leader did not fall down. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak joined other leaders in condemning the attack as he said on X on Saturday: \"Violence has no place in politics. \"Democracies must be free from intimidation and threats. Wishing Mette a swift recovery.\" Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said on X he was \"appalled\" by news of the assault, adding \"violence and intimidation of politicians must not be tolerated\". \"My thoughts are with Prime Minister Frederiksen during this time,\" he added in the post. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato Secretary-General, said he was shocked to hear of what happened to Ms Frederiksen, whom he called a friend. \"NATO allies stand together to protect our values, freedom, democracy and our rule of law,\" Mr Stoltenberg wrote on the social media platform on Saturday.

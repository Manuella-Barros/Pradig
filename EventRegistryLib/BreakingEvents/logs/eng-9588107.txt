Please read at your own discretion.\n\nA new accuser has filed a lawsuit against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs alleging the musician drugged and sexually assaulted her at his New York City recording studio in 2003.\n\nModel Crystal McKinney filed the lawsuit on Tuesday in New York City's federal court. She said she was 22 years old when she first met Combs, 12 years her senior, at a Men's Fashion Week event in Manhattan, People magazine reported.\n\nCombs, 54, has already been accused of a series of abuses from several different victims, with allegations including gang rape, sex trafficking and physical and sexual abuse.\n\nMcKinney's lawsuit is the seventh to name Combs in recent months.\n\nShe said she was introduced to Combs via a designer, who was not named in the lawsuit. At the Fashion Week event, the lawsuit says McKinney \"felt little control over the events as she was directed what to do and put on display, for the others in attendance.\"\n\nMcKinney said she sat across from Combs, who told her that she \"was going to make it big one day\" and that he had the industry connections to make it happen. She claimed Combs behaved in a \"sexually suggestive manner\" throughout the event. Combs and McKinney exchanged phone numbers.\n\nMcKinney alleged Combs invited her to his studio, where one of his associates gave her marijuana. McKinney said she later learned Combs had \"laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nAfter smoking the joint and drinking alcohol, both of which the lawsuit alleges Combs pressured her to do, McKinney said she became severely intoxicated.\n\nShe alleged Combs led her to a bathroom where he forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nAfter returning to the studio, McKinney said she lost consciousness and woke up in a taxi, where she realized she'd been assaulted.\n\nRepresentatives for Combs have not commented publicly on the new lawsuit filed by McKinney.\n\nIn March, Combs' Los Angeles home was raided by Homeland Security agents as part of a federal investigation for sex trafficking. He has not been formally charged with any crimes.\n\nLast week, disturbing video emerged of the hip-hop mogul violently attacking singer and ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016.\n\nIn November 2023, Ventura sued Combs for rape and sex trafficking allegedly spanning over a decade. Combs settled privately with Ventura, though his lawyers said the settlement was in no way an admission of guilt.\n\nAfter the hotel video was released, Combs made a public apology, saying in a video he was \"truly sorry,\" and his actions were \"inexcusable.\" He claimed to have since sought therapy and entered rehab.\n\nBefore the apology, Combs had denied all allegations of misconduct and illegal behaviour, and had vowed to clear his name.\n\nAs well as sexual assault and drugging, McKinney claimed Combs \"blackballed\" her modelling career. She said she \"blamed herself\" for the assault and attempted suicide in 2004.\n\nShe is seeking unspecified damages for pain and suffering, in addition to punitive damages. She has asked for a jury trial.\n\nThe lawsuit named Combs, as well as his companies Bad Boy Records and Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing and Universal Music Group.\n\nSeveral women and one man have already filed sexual assault and harassment lawsuits against Combs. Of the seven lawsuits against Combs, only Ventura's has been settled. One of the suits named Combs as a defendant but brought allegations of sexual assault against his son, Christian \"King\" Combs.\n\n--", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title":

This comes just days after Combs says he took \"full responsibility\" for beating ex-girlfriend Cassie after a video of that incident surfaced.\n\nThe new lawsuit - the sixth complaint of sexual assault filed against Combs in six months - alleges that McKinney, then 22, met Combs at a Men's Fashion Week event at a Manhattan restaurant.\n\n\"Once seated, Combs made a very public display of coming on to plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner,\" the filing states. \"Throughout their interactions, Combs was flirtatious, bordering on leering, as he leaned across the table towards her. Combs also plied plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\"\n\nLater that evening, Combs invited McKinney to his recording studio, where McKinney says she was given alcohol and marijuana that she now thinks was laced with a narcotic, according to the lawsuit. Combs led her to a bathroom where he began kissing her without her consent, McKinney alleges. He shoved her head down to his crotch and, after she refused, forced her to perform oral sex on him, the lawsuit claims.\n\nMcKinney says she passed out soon after and woke up in a cab and realized that she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nRepresentatives for Combs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this lawsuit.\n\nCombs, 54, has faced increasing legal troubles since ex-girlfriend Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit against him in November, alleging that Combs subjected her to years of abuse including beatings and rape. The lawsuit was swiftly settled - the next day - after Combs, through his attorney, said he \"vehemently denies\" the accusations.\n\nAfter Ventura's lawsuit, two more followed in the same month from women accusing Combs of rape.\n\nThen, in December, another woman alleged in a new lawsuit that in 2003 when she was 17, Combs and two other men raped her.\n\nAnd in February, a music producer sued Combs, alleging Combs had sexually assaulted him and forced him to have sex with prostitutes. Combs has denied all the claims against him.\n\nIn March, two of Combs' homes were raided in what officials have said is a sex-trafficking investigation.\n\nCombs was then named in a lawsuit that claimed that his son Christian \"King\" Combs had sexually assaulted a woman working on a yacht chartered by his father.\n\nCombs has come under intense scrutiny after a video aired on CNN showing Combs attacking Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016. The attack closely mirrors an assault that Ventura described in her lawsuit. On Sunday, Combs posted a video to Instagram, saying: \"My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\" He fails to mention Ventura by name.\n\nMcKinney says in her complaint that she was moved to step forward when she saw news coverage of the lawsuits from Ventura and the others. \"She knew she had a moral obligation to speak up,\" her filing states. \"Plaintiff seeks justice for herself and for any of the other Combs victims.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Allies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Allies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/515468f178f8f2ad669eb179e4decd12", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

McKinney said she was offered a joint, which she later came to believe had been laced with a \"narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nAfter she \"insisted that she had enough,\" she said, Combs pressured her to continue drinking and smoking and \"demanded\" she follow him to the bathroom.\n\nThere, the suit alleges, Combs \"forced himself\" on McKinney, kissing her without her consent and pushing her head down to his crotch. Despite her refusals, she said, he then forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nCombs then led McKinney back into the studio, where she passed out, according to the lawsuit. When she awoke, she was alone in a taxicab headed back to the home of an unnamed fashion designer who had introduced McKinney and Combs earlier that night. McKinney said that she realized she had been assaulted once she regained consciousness.\n\nMcKinney's attorneys were not immediately available to clarify whether her realization was in regard to the allegations of forced oral sex, or to some other event that occurred while she was unconscious.\n\nCombs faces multiple allegations of sexual assault dating back decades. He's also the subject of a federal inquiry into sex trafficking allegations. His representatives did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment.\n\nMcKinney's lawsuit comes days after surveillance video from 2016 showed Combs beating up his former girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, who filed a lawsuit against Combs in November that accused him of rape. That suit was quickly settled, but Combs has since denied the allegations.\n\nIn a video released Saturday, Combs apologized for the actions captured on camera.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Combs said in his Instagram apology. \"I was f -- up -- I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.\"\n\nAccording to McKinney's lawsuit, the former model felt a \"moral obligation\" to come forward with her account after Ventura and four others accused Combs of sexual misconduct.\n\nFollowing the alleged sexual assault, McKinney said, she was \"blackballed\" from the modeling industry, experienced anxiety and depression, and in 2004 attempted suicide.\n\n\"Combs' assault has altered the trajectory of [McKinney's] career,\" the suit states. \"To this day, [McKinney] faces bouts of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness and intimacy issues because of Combs' assault.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also names Combs' businesses, Bad Boy Records and Sean John Clothing, and music label Universal Music, as defendants, saying they had enabled Combs' alleged behavior.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is the sixth sexual assault complaint filed against Combs in six months.\n\nAccording to the complaint, \"Once seated, Combs made a very public display of coming on to plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner.\" \"Combs was flirty and almost leering during their conversations,\n\nLater that evening, Combs invited McKinney to his recording studio, where McKinney says she was given alcohol and marijuana that she now thinks was laced with a narcotic, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMcKinney says she passed out soon after and woke up in a cab and realized that she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nCombs, 54, has faced increasing legal troubles since ex-girlfriend Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit against him in November, alleging that Combs subjected her to years of abuse including beatings and rape.\n\nThe lawsuit was swiftly settled - the next day - after Combs, through his attorney, said he \"vehemently denies\" the accusations.\n\nThen, in December, another woman alleged in a new lawsuit that in 2003 when she was 17, Combs and two other men raped her.\n\nAnd in February, a music producer sued Combs, alleging Combs had sexually assaulted him and forced him to have sex with prostitutes. Combs has denied all the claims against him.\n\nIn March, two of Combs' homes were raided in what officials have said is a sex-trafficking investigation.\n\nThen, Combs was mentioned in a lawsuit alleging that his son Christian \"King\" Combs had molested a lady who worked on a boat that his father had chartered.\n\nAfter a video of Combs assaulting Ventura in a hotel corridor in 2016 appeared on CNN, Combs has been the subject of intense investigation. The assault and the one Ventura recounted in her claim are very similar. \"My behavior on that video is inexcusable,\" Combs wrote in a video that he uploaded to Instagram on Sunday. He doesn't specifically address Ventura.\n\nAccording to McKinney's complaint, she was inspired to come forward after seeing news reports about Ventura and the other lawsuits.

Nowadays, [McKinney] faces episodes of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness, and intimacy issues because of Combs' assault.\n\nThe lawsuit also names Combs' companies Bad Boy Records and Sean John Clothing, as well as music label Universal Music, as defendants, claiming they enabled Combs' alleged behavior.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoactive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychoactive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_John", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean John"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R&B", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary R&B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_image", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body image"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fed451/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2318x1217+0+89/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2F9e%2Fe6395311400d907a429772205bb7%2Fbet-awards-diddy-67268.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

During the dinner, McKinney alleges that Combs came onto her \"in a sexually suggestive manner\" and invited her to hang out at his recording studio.\n\nAfter arriving at the studio, where McKinney says several other men were present, she claims she was given alcohol and a marijuana joint that she later believed was laced \"with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" She alleges that Combs then led her to a bathroom, began kissing her without her consent, shoved her head into his crotch, and forced her to perform oral sex despite her protests.\n\nMcKinney, who was working as a professional model at the time, claims she later \"awakened in shock\" to find herself in a taxi heading back to the apartment of the designer who had invited her to the dinner. At this point, she \"realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\" the complaint states. Following the alleged assault, McKinney claims her \"modeling opportunities quickly began to dwindle and then evaporated entirely\" after Combs allegedly \"blackballed\" her in the industry. She states that she fell into \"a tailspin of anxiety and depression,\" attempted suicide in 2004, and later turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the trauma.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed under the NYC Gender Motivated Violence Act, which created a two-year lookback window beginning in March 2023 that allows survivors of gender-motivated violence to sue their abusers for incidents that occurred outside the statute of limitations.\n\nAlso named as defendants in the lawsuit are Combs' label Bad Boy Records, its parent company Universal Music Group, and Combs' clothing company Sean John Clothing. McKinney claims these entities \"enabled\" the alleged assault by \"actively maintaining and employing Combs in a position of power\" despite allegedly knowing that Combs posed a risk of sexual assault.\n\nMcKinney is seeking damages for mental and emotional injury, distress, pain and suffering, and injury to her reputation, as well as punitive damages and other relief.\n\nThis lawsuit marks the sixth sexual misconduct case filed against Combs in recent months. The series of lawsuits began with a November 2023 complaint filed by his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who alleged repeated abuse by Combs over more than a decade.\n\nAlthough Ventura's lawsuit was settled just one day later, a 2016 security video published by CNN on May 17 showed Combs physically assaulting Ventura in a hotel hallway. Though Combs denied all of Ventura's initial allegations, he issued an apology for his behavior in the video, calling it \"inexcusable.\" L.A. District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n later stated that Combs could not be prosecuted for the assault due to the statute of limitations.\n\nCombs has strongly denied all allegations of sexual assault. On December 6, he released a statement saying, \"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family, and for the truth.\"\n\nIn November, Combs stepped down as chairman of his digital media company Revolt before reportedly selling his stake in the company in March. Also in March, federal agents conducted raids of Combs' L.A. and Miami homes \"in connection\" with a federal sex trafficking investigation, according to CNN.", "source": {"uri": "balleralert.com",

her to the bathroom, where the sexual assault allegedly took place.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Combs then led her back to the studio and she lost consciousness, later awakening in a taxi and

McKinney said she was offered a joint, which she later came to believe had been laced with a \"narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nAfter she \"insisted that she had enough,\" she said, Combs pressured her to continue drinking and smoking and \"demanded\" she follow him to the bathroom.\n\nThere, the suit alleges, Combs \"forced himself\" on McKinney, kissing her without her consent and pushing her head down to his crotch. Despite her refusals, she said, he then forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nCombs then led McKinney back into the studio, where she passed out, according to the lawsuit. When she awoke, she was alone in a taxicab headed back to the home of an unnamed fashion designer who had introduced McKinney and Combs earlier that night. McKinney said that she realized she had been assaulted once she regained consciousness.\n\nMcKinney's attorneys were not immediately available to clarify whether her realization was in regard to the allegations of forced oral sex, or to some other event that occurred while she was unconscious.\n\nCombs faces multiple allegations of sexual assault dating back decades. He's also the subject of a federal inquiry into sex trafficking allegations. His representatives did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment.\n\nMcKinney's lawsuit comes days after surveillance video from 2016 showed Combs beating up his former girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, who filed a lawsuit against Combs in November that accused him of rape. That suit was quickly settled, but Combs has since denied the allegations.\n\nIn a video released Saturday, Combs apologized for the actions captured on camera.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Combs said in his Instagram apology. \"I was f -- up -- I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.\"\n\nAccording to McKinney's lawsuit, the former model felt a \"moral obligation\" to come forward with her account after Ventura and four others accused Combs of sexual misconduct.\n\nFollowing the alleged sexual assault, McKinney said, she was \"blackballed\" from the modeling industry, experienced anxiety and depression, and in 2004 attempted suicide.\n\n\"Combs' assault has altered the trajectory of [McKinney's] career,\" the suit states. \"To this day, [McKinney] faces bouts of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness and intimacy issues because of Combs' assault.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also names Combs' businesses, Bad Boy Records and Sean John Clothing, and music label Universal Music, as defendants, saying they had enabled Combs' alleged behavior.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Credits: Video - Newshub; Image - Getty Images\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs has been accused of sexual assault in a new lawsuit filed on Tuesday (local time) by Crystal McKinney, a former model and winner of MTV's 1998 Model Mission competition show.\n\nAccording to the complaint, filed in New York and obtained by CNN, McKinney claims that she was \"drugged and sexually assaulted\" in 2003 by Combs following a Men's Fashion Week event in New York City.\n\nMcKinney, who was 22 at the time, first met Combs at a dinner, where he came on to her \"in a sexually suggestive manner\" and told her to call him later, the complaint alleges. McKinney \"felt confused but hopeful that Combs would fulfill his promises to help her career,\" and Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, the complaint continues.\n\nAt the studio, Combs offered McKinney marijuana, which she claims was \"laced\" with \"a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" The complaint alleges Combs saw McKinney was \"very intoxicated\" and demanded her to follow him as he \"physically led\" her to the bathroom.\n\nIn the bathroom, Combs \"began kissing her without her consent\" and later \"forced her to perform oral sex on him,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAfter the assault, McKinney claims she felt \"more and more woozy and then lost consciousness,\" later waking up in a taxicab heading back to the apartment belonging to the designer she was working with at the time.\n\n\"As her consciousness returned, Plaintiff realised that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\" the complaint reads.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Combs and McKinney for comment, as well as representatives for Bad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing LLC, and Universal Music Group Inc., the entities of which were also named as defendants.\n\nMcKinney is suing the defendants for violation of the New York Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law.\n\nAccording to the New York City Council, the law gives \"survivors of gender-motivated acts of violence more time to pursue civil actions by extending the statute of limitations\" and also \"applies to such acts committed by parties who direct, enable, participate in, or conspire in a gender-motivated act of violence.\"\n\nMcKinney was crowned the winner of MTV's Model Mission in 1998 and was awarded a modeling contract with IMG. She became a familiar face on various MTV shows and modeled in a fashion campaign for designer Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nAs a result of the incident, McKinney became \"severely depressed,\" and \"experienced alcohol and drug addiction\" as she tried to cope, the complaint claimed. To this day, the complaint states, McKinney still experiences mental health struggles stemming from the alleged assault and has since ceased pursuing a career in modeling.\n\nShe is seeking an unspecified amount in punitive and compensatory damages.\n\nLatest suit in a series against Combs\n\nThis latest lawsuit comes days after CNN released exclusive surveillance footage that showed Combs physically attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016.\n\nThe attack was first referenced in a November 2023 lawsuit that Ventura brought against the rap mogul, whom she dated off and on from 2007 to 2018.\n\nIn her complaint that was settled a day after being filed, Ventura alleged Combs raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their relationship.\n\nFollowing the settlement, an attorney for Combs said the \"decision to settle a lawsuit... is in no way an admission of wrongdoing.\"\n\nCombs apologised on Sunday for his actions in the video.\n\nVentura's attorney Meredith Firetog criticised his response saying, \"When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.\"\n\nThis is the seventh lawsuit in which Combs has been named in recent months. Six of those lawsuits, including the one filed Tuesday, contain allegations of sexual assault. One of the six suits names Combs as a defendant but was was brought against Combs' son, Christian Combs. Only Ventura's has been settled.\n\nAuthorities searched Diddy's homes on March 25, 2024 as he is a target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in the civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches.\n\nCNN", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [],

The outlet obtained court documents filed by model Crystal McKinney, who claims that Combs drugged her and assaulted her at his studio in 2003. So far, Combs and his representatives have not commented publicly on this new lawsuit.\n\nMcKinney met Combs in 2003 when she was 20 years old, according to her lawsuit. She wrote that an unnamed fashion designer introduced her to Combs during an event for Men's Fashion Week in New York City. That designer \"began to direct [her] appearance, as he sought to ensure Combs found her attractive.\" McKinney already had a promising resume at that point, but claims that Combs flattered her by predicting that she \"was going to make it big one day.\" However, after his attack she said her career opportunities \"quickly began to dwindle then evaporated entirely.\"\n\nMcKinney said that Combs' flirtation boreded \"on leering\" during dinner, and that he seemed intent on keeping her wine glass full. Afterward, he invited her to his studio, and she went along with the understanding that they wouldn't be alone there. However, she claims that she found herself in the studio with Combs and several other men, all drinking and smoking cannabis. She said that she accepted a joint and \"later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nMcKinney said that she became very inebriated quickly, and once Combs noticed this, he led her insistently to the bathroom. There, she claims he \"forced himself [on her] and began kissing her without her consent.\" She claims that he then \"forced her to perform oral sex on him,\" and shortly after that she completely lost consciousness. She came to in a taxi headed back to the designer's apartment, and \"as her consciousness returned, [she] realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs.\"\n\nIn addition to the attack, McKinney claims that she was \"blackballed\" in the industry after that and believes Diddy was the culprit. In addition to her account of the incident, she claims that she saved the clothing she wore that night, unwashed and wrapped in plastic as possible evidence.\n\nThis is the sixth lawsuit for sexual assault filed against Combs since November. On top of that, Combs is the subject of a federal investigation of sex trafficking allegations, which prompted coordinated raids on two of his homes at the same time. Combs' lawyers denied any wrongdoing related to the federal case, while the lawsuits are being handled one by one.", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/11/16/f6a30d45-66b9-4a12-b246-b96adb20289e/diddy.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

But it sparked increased scrutiny of Combs, with several other lawsuits filed in the following months, as well as a federal sex trafficking investigation that led authorities to search Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nThe suit was filed Tuesday under a New York City law that allows accusers to file a civil suit for a limited period of time, even if the events allegedly occurred a long time ago.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/37/54/34/25085755/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

(Scripps News)\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs is being sued by a model who says the rapper drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2003.\n\nIn court documents obtained by Scripps News, Crystal McKinney alleges she sustained \"substantial and lifetime injuries\" as a result of the incident.\n\nMcKinney met Combs when she was 22 years old after being invited to attend a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in New York City in 2003.\n\nCombs had been representing his clothing brand Sean John.\n\nA fashion designer who invited her to the event, referred to only as \"the designer\" in the lawsuit, worked to ensure McKinney looked good for the occasion so that Combs would find her attractive, the lawsuit says. The designer told McKinney she would introduce her to him.\n\nAt the dinner event, Combs \"made a very public display of coming on to [McKinney] in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner,\" says the lawsuit.\n\nDocuments claim Combs continued complimenting the model's looks throughout the night. He told her he had power in the industry and could help advance her career.\n\nCombs gave his phone number to the model as a measure of good faith that he would keep his word, the lawsuit says. But the rapper continued to be flirtatious throughout the evening, at times \"bordering leering,\" according to the lawsuit. He also repeatedly kept filling her glass with wine.\n\nLater that evening, after the event, Combs insisted McKinney visit his studio. She said felt reassured she would be in the presence of others, rather than alone with him in a personal residence.\n\nCombs and several other men were gathered together when she arrived.\n\nAn associate of Combs asked her if she's ever smoked weed, and when she said yes, he replied, \"You've never had weed like this before.\"\n\nMcKinney \"later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nCombs pressured her to continue consuming alcohol and marijuana even when she said she had enough. McKinney \"felt as if she was floating,\" says the lawsuit.\n\nWhile she was very intoxicated, Combs made her go into a bathroom with him, documents say.\n\nIn the bathroom, \"Combs forced himself on [McKinney] and began kissing her without her consent. Combs then shoved her head down to his crotch before commanding her to 'suck it,'\" the lawsuit details. \"[McKinney] refused, but Combs pushed her head down onto his phallus and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\"\n\nCelebrity\n\nNYC mayor considers rescinding Diddy's key to the city after assault video Elina Tarkazikis 11:18 AM, May 20, 2024\n\nCombs brought McKinney back into the studio after, and while feeling physically ill, she lost consciousness, the lawsuit claims.

Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, according to the federal complaint filed in New York City.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that McKinney arrived to find Combs drinking and smoking joints with several other men. She smoked some marijuana, which she \"later came to understand\" was laced with a narcotic or intoxicating substance, the lawsuit says. She felt as though she was floating. Combs led her to the bathroom, where the sexual assault took place, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs led her back to the studio and she lost consciousness, the lawsuit says. She later awakened in a taxi and realized that she had been sexually assaulted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs' representatives did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as McKinney has done.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed days after CNN aired security video that shows Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Combs on Sunday released a video admitting he attacked Cassie in the hotel hallway, saying he was \"truly sorry\" and his actions were \"inexcusable.\"\n\nCombs is not in danger of being criminally prosecuted for the beating because of the statute of limitations.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Cassie in November alleging beatings and abuse was settled a day after it was filed. But it spurred intense scrutiny of Combs, with several more lawsuits filed in the following months, along with a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led authorities to raid Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nThe claim on Tuesday was filed under a New York City law that allows accusers to file civil litigation during a limited window even if the events allegedly happened long ago.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/wboc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/cc/7ccc9544-2f24-55c3-b4f0-c25dd397f33a/664d4ea92ce5d.image.jpg?crop=1766%2C927%2C0%2C123&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

According to the lawsuit, the male designer carefully crafted McKinney's look to please Combs and then ordered her to sit directly across from Combs at the table.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\n\"Once seated, Combs made a very public display of coming on to plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner,\" the filings states. \"Throughout their interactions, Combs was flirtatious, bordering on leering, as he leaned across the table towards her. Combs also plied Plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Combs invited McKinney back to his Manhattan recording studio, and she believed it was safe to join him there because it was a professional setting as opposed to a personal residence. She claims Combs passed her a joint that she believes was laced with a narcotic and then led her to a bathroom as she felt increasingly intoxicated, like \"she was floating.\"\n\n\"In the bathroom, Combs forced himself on plaintiff and began kissing her without her consent,\" the lawsuit claims. \"Combs, then, shoved her head down to his crotch before commanding her to 'suck it.' Plaintiff refused, but Combs pushed her head down onto his phallus and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\"\n\nIn the filing, McKinney says the assault made her \"physically sick\" and that she passed out a short time later. She woke up \"in shock to find herself in a taxicab heading back to the designer's apartment,\" the paperwork adds.\n\nReps for Combs did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment. The new lawsuit arrives after Combs' former partner Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura first sued him for sex trafficking and rape in November. Two more women, Liza Gardner and Joi Dickerson-Neal, sued Combs a week after Ventura's filing, alleging the music mogul raped them 1990 and 1991 respectively. A fourth woman sued Combs in early December, alleging he lured her to his studio when she was 17 years old and gang raped her with two other men. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones sued Combs in February with allegations Combs sexually harassed and assaulted him during his time working on Combs' latest album.\n\nCombs, 54, issued a blanket denial of the allegations from the four women, including Ventura, in December. He later dismissed Jones' complaint as a \"work of fiction.\"\n\nLast week, CNN obtained and aired a harrowing video showing Combs beating Ventura in the hallway of Los Angeles' InterContinental Hotel in 2016. In the surveillance video, Combs was seen yanking Ventura backwards to the floor, kicking her, stomping on her, and attempting to drag her back to a room.\n\nCombs responded to the video on Sunday, apologizing for the hotel incident in a video posted on his social media. \"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you gotta do that,\" Combs said in the apology video. \"I was fucked up, I mean I hit rock bottom, and I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, and I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. Had to go into therapy, go into rehab, had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry, but I'm committed to being a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nMcKinney's complaint names Combs, Bad Boy Records, Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing, and Universal Music as defendants and says her decades-old claim is viable under New York City's Gender Motivated Violence Act, which revives claims against any party who \"commits, directs, enables, participates in or conspires in the commission of a crime of violence motivated by gender.\"\n\nThe new lawsuit says sexual assault is an act of gender motivated violence, and that McKinney was \"humiliated and traumatized\" by the physical attack. She alleges she was \"blackballed\" in her industry and tipped into a \"tailspin of anxiety and depression.\"\n\nMcKinney says in her complaint that she was moved to step forward when she saw news coverage of the lawsuits from Ventura, Dickerson-Neal, and the others. \"She knew she had a moral obligation to speak up,\" her filing states. \"Plaintiff seeks justice for herself and for any of the other Combs victims.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score":

He said he sought therapy and entered rehab shortly afterward and was working to \"be a better man.\"\n\nHe has previously denied all allegations of abuse and wrongdoing and vowed to clear his name.\n\nMcKinney, who was a 22-year-old model at the time of the alleged assault, met Combs at a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in Manhattan, and Combs said she \"was going to make it big one day\" as a model and promised he'd help her career, she said in the suit.\n\nCombs invited her to his studio, where one of his associates offered her a joint of marijuana and said \"you've never had weed like this before,\" the lawsuit says.\n\n\"Plaintiff later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance,\" it alleges.\n\nCombs pressured McKinney to smoke more and drink alcohol, though she was severely intoxicated, the suit claims.\n\n\"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated, Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" the lawsuit says. Combs then forced her to perform a sex act, she alleges in the suit.\n\nAttorneys for McKinney declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nMcKinney said in her lawsuit that she was dazed after the alleged sexual assault in the bathroom and that she passed out in Combs' studio. She woke up in a taxi and realized she'd been sexually assaulted, she alleges in the suit, which also said she saved the clothes she was wearing that night in a plastic bag.\n\nMcKinney said in the lawsuit that after the alleged sexual assault, her modeling opportunities dried up and that she believes Combs \"blackballed\" her.\n\nMcKinney \"became severely depressed as she began to blame herself for the assault and for sabotaging her own career,\" the lawsuit says. She even feared retaliation from Combs, according to the suit.\n\nThe suit seeks unspecified damages for pain and suffering, as well as punitive damages.\n\nThe suit names Combs, as well as Bad Boy Records and Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing and Universal Music Group.\n\nUniversal Music Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is not related to NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.\n\nMcKinney's is the seventh lawsuit filed in recent months against Combs, known for his music career and for founding Bad Boy Records, as well as TV shows like \"Making the Band\" and movie appearances.\n\nEx-girlfriend Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura sued Combs in November, alleging rape and abuse during their relationship, including being punched, stomped and kicked. A settlement was reached the next day.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation said in March that federal officials had interviewed three women and a man in Manhattan in relation to allegations of sex trafficking, sexual assault and soliciting and distributing illegal narcotics and firearms.\n\nFederal agents searched Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami. Three sources familiar with the matter said firearms were found at his residences, but no additional details were provided.\n\nAaron Dyer, one of Combs' attorneys, said in a statement after the

According to the lawsuit, the male designer carefully crafted McKinney's look to please Combs and then ordered her to sit directly across from Combs at the table.\n\n\"Once seated, Combs made a very public display of coming on to plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner,\" the filings states. \"Throughout their interactions, Combs was flirtatious, bordering on leering, as he leaned across the table towards her. Combs also plied Plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Combs invited McKinney back to his Manhattan recording studio, and she believed it was safe to join him there because it was a professional setting as opposed to a personal residence. She claims Combs passed her a joint that she believes was laced with a narcotic and then led her to a bathroom as she felt increasingly intoxicated, like \"she was floating.\"\n\n\"In the bathroom, Combs forced himself on plaintiff and began kissing her without her consent,\" the lawsuit claims. \"Combs, then, shoved her head down to his crotch before commanding her to 'suck it.' Plaintiff refused, but Combs pushed her head down onto his phallus and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\"\n\nIn the filing, McKinney says the assault made her \"physically sick\" and that she passed out a short time later. She woke up \"in shock to find herself in a taxicab heading back to the designer's apartment,\" the paperwork adds.\n\nReps for Combs did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment. The new lawsuit arrives after Combs' former partner Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura first sued him for sex trafficking and rape in November. Two more women, Liza Gardner and Joi Dickerson-Neal, sued Combs a week after Ventura's filing, alleging the music mogul raped them 1990 and 1991 respectively. A fourth woman sued Combs in early December, alleging he lured her to his studio when she was 17 years old and gang raped her with two other men. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones sued Combs in February with allegations Combs sexually harassed and assaulted him during his time working on Combs' latest album.\n\nCombs, 54, issued a blanket denial of the allegations from the four women, including Ventura, in December. He later dismissed Jones' complaint as a \"work of fiction.\"\n\nLast week, CNN obtained and aired a harrowing video showing Combs beating Ventura in the hallway of Los Angeles' InterContinental Hotel in 2016. In the surveillance video, Combs was seen yanking Ventura backwards to the floor, kicking her, stomping on her, and attempting to drag her back to a room.\n\nCombs responded to the video on Sunday, apologizing for the hotel incident in a video posted on his social media. \"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you gotta do that,\" Combs said in the apology video. \"I was fucked up, I mean I hit rock bottom, and I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, and I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. Had to go into therapy, go into rehab, had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry, but I'm committed to being a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nancy_dillon@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nancy Dillon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "cheyenne_roundtree@rollingstone.com", "name": "Cheyenne Roundtree", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phallus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gang rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/diddy-another-accuser.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

As reportedly detailed in the complaint, the alleged sexual assault took place at Combs' New York recording studio when McKinney was 22 years old. Per Rolling Stone, this is the sixth sexual assault-related complaint filed against Combs in as many months.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, claims that McKinney met Combs through an unnamed fashion designer during Men's Fashion Week in New York over two decades ago. According to the Times' recounting of the complaint, Combs allegedly invited the 22-year-old to his studio, where McKinney says she was given alcohol and marijuana that she believes was laced with a narcotic. Later, McKinney claimed in the complaint that Combs took her to the bathroom, pushed her head near his crotch, and forced her to perform oral sex after she had refused. Per the lawsuit, only upon regaining consciousness hours later in a cab did McKinney remember the alleged sexual assault. The Cut has reached out to representatives for Combs and will update this post when we hear back.\n\nPer the Times, McKinney said she decided to file a lawsuit after learning of the handful of complaints that had already been filed against Combs, including by his former girlfriend Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura. Because the allegations are over 20 years old, they are technically outside the statute of limitations. However, the Times reports that the lawsuit has invoked New York City's Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Act, which temporarily allows survivors to file complaints after the statute of limitations has run out. The complaint comes less than a week after the release of a 2016 video that shows Combs assaulting Cassie, for which Combs has since apologized.

In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in New York, model Crystal McKinney claims Combs coerced and sexually assaulted her in 2003.\n\nMcKinney alleges in the suit that when she was 22, Combs invited her to a recording studio after a Men's Fashion Week event, where he then pressured her to take photos. drugs and alcohol and forced her to have oral sex. According to the suit, McKinney claims he was unknowingly given marijuana laced with \"a narcotic or other intoxicating substance\" and that in his disoriented state, Combs physically took the intoxicated McKinney into the room. bath and imposed himself on her. Afterwards, McKinney says she lost consciousness and woke up in a taxi. The suit alleges that Combs then used his influence to blackball McKinney from the industry.\n\nThis is the sixth civil lawsuit filed against Combs since last November, all accusing him of similar assault crimes. The lawsuit comes just days after surveillance footage was leaked showing Combs attacking his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a hotel hallway, consistent with a 2016 incident described in the filing that took place in the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. . McKinney says in his complaint that the documents filed by Ventura and others made him feel a \"moral obligation\" to come forward. Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment label, its parent company Universal Music Group and his Sean John clothing company are also named in the suit.\n\nIn March, teams of federal agents conducted coordinated raids on two homes associated with Combs. One of his lawyers called the action \"a premature rush to judgment against Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on baseless accusations made in civil suits.\" Following surveillance footage showing Combs assaulting Ventura, the record exec posted an apology video on his Instagram (May 19): \"My behavior in this video is inexcusable,\" he says to the camera. \"I take full responsibility for my actions in this video. ... I was disgusted at the time when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\n\nIn a statement released the same day, Ventura's lawyers rejected the apology. \"Combs' most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt,\" it read. \"When Cassie and several other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested his victims were looking for pay.

Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, according to the federal complaint filed in New York City.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that McKinney arrived to find Combs drinking and smoking joints with several other men. She smoked some marijuana, which she \"later came to understand\" was laced with a narcotic or intoxicating substance, the lawsuit says. She felt as though she was floating. Combs led her to the bathroom, where the sexual assault took place, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs led her back to the studio and she lost consciousness, the lawsuit says. She later awakened in a taxi and realized that she had been sexually assaulted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs' representatives did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as McKinney has done.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed days after CNN aired security video that shows Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Combs on Sunday released a video admitting he attacked Cassie in the hotel hallway, saying he was \"truly sorry\" and his actions were \"inexcusable.\"\n\nCombs is not in danger of being criminally prosecuted for the beating because of the statute of limitations.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Cassie in November alleging beatings and abuse was settled a day after it was filed. But it spurred intense scrutiny of Combs, with several more lawsuits filed in the following months, along with a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led authorities to raid Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nThe claim on Tuesday was filed under a New York City law that allows accusers to file civil litigation during a limited window even if the events allegedly happened long ago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

While attending the dinner, during which she alleges Combs approached her \"in a sexually suggestive manner,\" she says he asked her out to his recording studio.\n\nAfter arriving at the studio, where McKinney says several other men were present, she claims she was given alcohol and a marijuana joint that she said was laced \"with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" \". She says Combs then led her to the bathroom, where he began kissing her without her consent before pushing her head into his crotch and forcing her to have oral sex despite her protests.\n\nMcKinney, who was working as a professional model at the time, says she then \"woke up in shock\" to find herself in a taxi headed to the apartment of the designer who had invited her to dinner. At this point, she \"realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\" the complaint states. The lawsuit adds that following the alleged assault, McKinney's \"modeling opportunities quickly began to diminish and then evaporate completely\" after Combs allegedly \"blackballed\" her from the industry. After falling into \"a spiral of anxiety and depression,\" she says she attempted suicide in 2004 and later fell into drug and alcohol addiction to cope with the trauma of the alleged assault.\n\nThe new lawsuit was filed under New York's gender-motivated violence law, which created a two-year look-back period starting in March 2023 that allows survivors of gender-motivated violence to sue their attackers for alleged incidents that occurred outside the statute of limitations.\n\nAlso named as defendants in the lawsuit are Combs' record label, Bad Boy Records, its parent company Universal Music Group, and Combs' clothing company, Sean John Clothing, all of which McKinney says \"enabled\" the alleged assault by \"actively maintaining and employing Combs in a position of power\" despite the fact that they \"knew or should have known that Combs posed a risk of sexual assault.\"\n\nMcKinney seeks damages for mental and emotional harm, distress, pain and suffering, and reputational damage, as well as punitive damages, among other relief.\n\nRepresentatives for Combs, Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing and Universal Music Group did not immediately respond. Billboard\" requests for feedback.\n\nTuesday's complaint marks the sixth sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against Combs in recent months. The torrent of lawsuits was kicked off by a lawsuit filed in November 2023 by his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, which alleged repeated abuse by the mogul over the course of more than a decade.\n\nAlthough Ventura's lawsuit was settled a day later, a 2016 security video released by CNN on Friday (May 17) showed Combs physically assaulting Ventura in a hotel hallway. Although Combs denied all of Ventura's initial allegations, following the video's release, he issued an apology, calling his behavior in the clip \"inexcusable.\" Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon later released a statement saying Combs could not be prosecuted for the assault due to the statute of limitations.\n\nCombs has strongly denied all allegations of sexual assault made against him. On December 6, he released a statement that said: \"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the horrible things alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\n\nIn November, Combs resigned as president of his digital media company Revolt before selling his stake in the company in March. Also in March, federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami \"as part of a federal sex trafficking investigation, according to CNN.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType":

The window for filing lawsuits under that act expires in 2025.\n\nMcKinney is also suing Combs' record label, Bad Boy Entertainment, his label's distributor, Universal Music Group, and Combs' fashion brand, Sean John Clothing.\n\nAccording to the suit, then 22-year-old McKinney, who was a rising fashion model, was introduced to Combs by an unnamed fashion designer in 2003. The suit alleges the designer dressed and styled McKinney \"to ensure Combs found her attractive\" before taking her to meet Combs at Cipriani Downtown, a New York City restaurant.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Combs made a number of flirtatious and sexually suggestive remarks about McKinney's appearance in front of the other dinner guests, including the designer. Later that night, Combs allegedly invited McKinney to his recording studio, where he was drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana with several male companions, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe lawsuit says that Comb passed McKinney a joint, saying, \"You've never had weed like this before,\" which McKinney interpreted to mean the marijuana was laced with some other drug.\n\n\"Although plaintiff insisted that she had enough after that, Combs pressured her to imbibe more alcohol and marijuana by telling her that she was acting too uptight,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nAfter McKinney became \"very intoxicated,\" the lawsuit claims, Combs led her into the bathroom and forced her to perform oral sex on him. Afterward, she alleges she lost consciousness and woke up in a cab.\n\nCBS News has reached out to Combs' representatives for comment. Universal Music Group declined to comment \"pending lawyers' review of the lawsuit.\"\n\nMcKinney claims her modeling opportunities disappeared after the alleged incident because Combs had her \"'blackballed' in the industry and utilized his significant influence to impede [her] career growth.\" According to the suit, in the years following the alleged incident, McKinney became anxious, depressed and addicted to drugs and alcohol, and she attempted suicide around 2004.\n\nThe lawsuit comes on the heels of a security video aired by CNN on Friday that allegedly shows Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Combs on Sunday publicly apologized for the incident, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable,\" and that he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions.\n\nEarlier this month, Combs asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit alleging that he and two co-defendants raped a 17-year-old girl in a New York recording studio in 2003, saying it was a \"false and hideous claim\" that was filed too late under the law.\n\nIn March, Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami were raided by Homeland Security Investigations agents and other law enforcement officers due to a possible ongoing sex trafficking investigation, U.S. officials said at the time.\n\nOther accusations against the music mogul include those made by two women in November last year, one week after he settled a separate lawsuit with the singer Cassie that contained allegations of rape and physical abuse. The women's lawsuits were filed on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.\n\nIn February, a male music producer also filed a federal lawsuit against Combs accusing him of sexual misconduct.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news",

McKinney \"felt confused but hopeful that Combs would fulfill his promises to help her career,\" and Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, the complaint continues.\n\nAt the studio, Combs offered McKinney marijuana, which she claims was \"laced\" with \"a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" The complaint alleges Combs saw McKinney was \"very intoxicated\" and demanded her to follow him as he \"physically led\" her to the bathroom.\n\nIn the bathroom, Combs \"began kissing her without her consent\" and later \"forced her to perform oral sex on him,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAfter the assault, McKinney claims she felt \"more and more woozy and then lost consciousness,\" later waking up in a taxicab heading back to the apartment belonging to the designer she was working with at the time. \"As her consciousness returned, Plaintiff realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\" the complaint reads.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Combs and McKinney for comment, as well as representatives for Bad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing LLC, and Universal Music Group Inc., the entities of which were also named as defendants.\n\nMcKinney is suing the defendants for violation of the New York Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law.\n\nAccording to the New York City Council, the law gives \"survivors of gender-motivated acts of violence more time to pursue civil actions by extending the statute of limitations\" and also \"applies to such acts committed by parties who direct, enable, participate in, or conspire in a gender-motivated act of violence.\"\n\nMcKinney was crowned the winner of MTV's Model Mission in 1998 and was awarded a modeling contract with IMG. She became a familiar face on various MTV shows and modeled in a fashion campaign for designer Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nAs a result of the incident, McKinney became \"severely depressed,\" and \"experienced alcohol and drug addiction\" as she tried to cope, the complaint claimed. To this day, the complaint states, McKinney still experiences mental health struggles stemming from the alleged assault and has since ceased pursuing a career in modeling.\n\nShe is seeking an unspecified amount in punitive and compensatory damages.\n\nLatest suit in a series against Combs\n\nThis latest lawsuit comes days after CNN released exclusive surveillance footage that showed Combs physically attacking his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016.\n\nThe attack was first referenced in a November 2023 lawsuit that Ventura brought against the rap mogul, whom she dated off and on from 2007 to 2018.\n\nIn her complaint that was settled a day after being filed, Ventura alleged Combs raped her in 2018 and subjected her to years of repeated physical and other abuses over the course of their relationship.\n\nFollowing the settlement, an attorney for Combs said the \"decision to settle a lawsuit...is in no way an admission of wrongdoing.\"\n\nCombs apologized on Sunday for his actions in the video.\n\nVentura's attorney Meredith Firetog criticized his response saying, \"When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.\"\n\nThis is the seventh lawsuit in which Combs has been named in recent months. Six of those lawsuits, including the one filed Tuesday, contain allegations of sexual assault. One of the six suits names Combs as a defendant but was was brought against Combs' son, Christian Combs. Only Ventura's has been settled.\n\nAuthorities searched Diddy's homes on March 25, 2024, because he is a target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in the civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches.\n\nCNN's Sandra Gonzalez contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType":

According to the lawsuit, the male designer carefully designed McKinney's look to please Combs, then ordered him to sit directly across from Combs at the table.\n\n\"Once seated, Combs made a very public display of addressing plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner that continued throughout the dinner,\" the filing states. \"Throughout their interactions, Combs was flirtatious, bordering on leering, as he leaned toward her across the table. Combs also induced the plaintiff to drink alcohol throughout the dinner while he repeatedly refilled her wine glass.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Combs invited McKinney back to his Manhattan recording studio and that she thought it was safe for him to join her there because it was a professional setting and not a personal residence . She claims Combs passed her a joint that she said contained a narcotic, then led her to the bathroom as she felt increasingly drunk, as if \"she was floating.\"\n\n\"In the bathroom, Combs forced himself on plaintiff and began kissing her without her consent,\" the lawsuit claims. \"Combs then pushed her head down to his crotch before ordering her to \"suck it.\" The plaintiff refused, but Combs pushed her head against his phallus and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\n\nIn the filing, McKinney claims the assault made her \"physically ill\" and she passed out shortly afterward. She woke up \"to the shock of finding herself in a taxi heading to the designer's apartment,\" the documents add.\n\nRepresentatives for Combs did not immediately respond to rolling stonerequest for comment. The new lawsuit comes after Combs' former partner, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, sued him for sex trafficking and rape in November. Two other women, Liza Gardner and Joi Dickerson-Neal, sued Combs a week after Ventura's filing, alleging the music mogul raped them in 1990 and 1991, respectively. A fourth woman sued Combs in early December, alleging he lured her to his studio when she was 17 and gang-raped her with two other men. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones sued Combs in February, alleging that Combs sexually harassed and assaulted him while working on Combs' latest album.\n\nCombs, 54, broadly denied the allegations made by the four women, including Ventura, in December. He then dismissed Jones' complaint as a \"work of fiction.\"\n\nLast week, CNN obtained and released a harrowing video showing Combs beating Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016. In the surveillance video, Combs was seen pulling Ventura backwards to the ground, kicking her, stomping on her and trying to drag her back into a room.\n\nCombs responded to the video on Sunday, apologizing for the hotel incident in a video posted to his social media. \"It's so hard to reflect on the darkest moments of your life, but sometimes you have to do it,\" Combs said in the apology video. \"I was screwed, I mean, I hit rock bottom and I can't make any excuses. My behavior in this video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in this video. I am disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, and I am now. I went there and sought professional help. I had to go to therapy, rehab, I had to ask God for mercy and grace. I am truly sorry, but I am committed to becoming a better man every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I am really sorry.\"\n\nMcKinney's complaint names Combs, Bad Boy Records, Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing and Universal Music as defendants and asserts that his decades-old claim is viable under the city of Texas' gender-based violence law. New York, which revives complaints against any party who \"commits, directs, permits, participates in or conspires to commit a crime of gender-motivated violence.\"\n\nThe new lawsuit claims the sexual assault was an act of gender-motivated violence and that McKinney was \"humiliated and traumatized\" by the physical attack. She alleges she was \"sidelined\" in her industry and plunged into a \"spiral of anxiety and depression.\"\n\nMcKinney says in her complaint that she was moved to come forward when she saw media coverage of the lawsuits filed by Ventura, Dickerson-Neal and the others. \"She knew she had a moral obligation to speak out,\" her filing says. \"The plaintiff is seeking justice for herself and all of Combs' other victims.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type":

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nA former model accused Sean \"Diddy\" Combs of sexually assaulting her at his New York City recording studio in 2003 in a lawsuit filed Tuesday, the latest in a series of allegations against the embattled hip-hop mogul.\n\nCrystal McKinney said she was a successful 22-year-old model when she met Combs at a restaurant during Men's Fashion Week in Manhattan. Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, according to the federal complaint filed in New York City.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that McKinney arrived to find Combs drinking and smoking joints with several other men. She smoked some marijuana, which she \"later came to understand\" was laced with a narcotic or intoxicating substance, the lawsuit says. She felt as though she was floating. Combs led her to the bathroom, where the sexual assault took place, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs led her back to the studio and she lost consciousness, the lawsuit says. She later awakened in a taxi and realized that she had been sexually assaulted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs' representatives did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as McKinney has done.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed days after CNN aired security video that shows Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Combs on Sunday released a video admitting he attacked Cassie in the hotel hallway, saying he was \"truly sorry\" and his actions were \"inexcusable.\"\n\nCombs is not in danger of being criminally prosecuted for the beating because of the statute of limitations.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Cassie in November alleging beatings and abuse was settled a day after it was filed. But it spurred intense scrutiny of Combs, with several more lawsuits filed in the following months, along with a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led authorities to raid Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nThe claim on Tuesday was filed under a New York City law that allows accusers to file civil litigation during a limited window even if the events allegedly happened long ago.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person",

According to the lawsuit, McKinney was introduced to Combs by a fashion designer who thought Combs could \"advance her modeling.\" career.\"\n\nThe complaint, filed in the Southern District Court of New York, alleged that Combs \"addressed Plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner\" at the restaurant where they were dining.\n\n\"Combs also made Plaintiff drink alcohol throughout the dinner while he repeatedly refilled her wine glass,\" the suit states.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, McKinney was invited back to Combs' recording studio and given what she thought was marijuana. The suit alleged that Combs began kissing her non-consensually and pointed to his crotch, asking her to \"suck it.\" After she refused, Combs lowered her head to force her to perform oral sex on him, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, she lost consciousness and later woke up in a taxi.\n\nMcKinney is suing Combs under New York's Gender-Based Violence Protection Act, a city law that allows civil lawsuits to be filed within two years, and she is seeking a jury trial. She is seeking an unspecified amount of damages for \"mental and emotional harm, distress, pain and suffering and damage to her reputation\".\n\nRepresentatives for Combs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMcKinney's lawyers declined to comment.\n\nCombs faces lawsuits from four others: A former employee and three women have accused Combs of sexual assault, abuse, drugging and other acts of sexual misconduct. One woman said in her complaint filed in December that Combs \"sex trafficked and gang raped\" her when she was 17 in 2003.\n\nCombs denied the previous allegations on Instagram and said he would \"fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\"\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, I have sat in silence and watched as people attempted to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,\" he said. \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick paycheck.\"\n\nA sixth complaint, filed in November by Comb's ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, accused the mogul of rape and abuse after they were together for more than a decade. The two sides settled the lawsuit a day after it was filed, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Friday, CNN released surveillance footage from 2016 that appeared to show Combs attacking Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel. Combs later apologized, calling his actions \"inexcusable\", although he did not specify what actions he was apologizing for, nor did he mention Ventura by name.\n\nOn March 25, the Department of Homeland Security searched Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami. He has not been charged with any crime related to the raid.\n\nIn a previous statement to Business Insider, Aaron Dyer, an attorney for Combs, called the search a \"gross overuse of military force.\"\n\n\"None of these allegations has resulted in a finding of criminal or civil liability,\" Dyer said. \"Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every day to clear his name.\"",

The suit alleges that Combs subsequently used his influence to have McKinney blackballed in the industry.\n\nThis is the sixth civil lawsuit filed against Combs since last November, all of which accuse him of similar crimes of assault. This suit comes just days after video surveillance footage leaked of Combs attacking his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a hotel hallway, aligning with a 2016 incident depicted in the filing that took place at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City in Los Angeles. McKinney says in her complaint the filings by Ventura and others made her feel a \"moral obligation\" to come forward. Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment label, its parent company Universal Music Group and his Sean John clothing company are also named in the suit.\n\nIn March, teams of federal agents conducted coordinated raids at two homes associated with Combs. One of his attorneys called the action \"a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits.\" In the aftermath of the surveillance footage showing Combs assaulting Ventura, the record executive posted an apology video on his Instagram (May 19): \"My behavior on that video is inexcusable,\" he says to the camera. \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. ... I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\n\nIn a statement the same day, Ventura's attorneys rebuffed the apology. \"Combs' most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt,\" it read. \"When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday. That he was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\" The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office revealed in its own statement that no case related to the attack had been presented to law enforcement, and that if the attack in the video had occurred in 2016 as reported, charges could not be filed due to the statute of limitations.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sidney_madden@npr.org", "name": "Sidney Madden",

Per Rolling Stone, this latest allegation comes from former model Crystal McKinney, who claims Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2003. This is the sixth sexual allegation publicly made against Combs in six months.\n\nMcKinney says she met Combs in 2003 at a dinner at New York City's Cipriani Downtown restaurant during Men's Fashion Week. McKinney, who was 22 at the time, said that an unidentified fashion designer invited her and reportedly outfitted McKinnsey in a manner that would attract Combs, ordering her to sit across from Combs at dinner.\n\nDuring their dinner, the filing states Combs continuously made public displays of a \"sexually suggestive manner\" toward McKinney. Combs is described as \"flirtatious, bordering on leering,\" as he \"plied Plaintiff with alcohol.\" Later that night, the Plaintiff says she went to his Manhattan recording studio because she figured a professional setting would be safe. McKinney says Combs gave her a joint that she believes was laced with narcotics, claiming she felt like \"she was floating.\"\n\nAs the night continued, it began to sound like other allegations against Combs. The suit claims Combs \"forced himself on plaintiff and began kissing her without consent.\" He then \"shoved her head to his crotch before commanding her to 'suck it.'\" When she refused, he allegedly \"pushed her head down onto his phallus and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\" McKinney said the assault made her \"physically sick,\" and she passed out shortly after.\n\nThis latest filing was made possible because of New York City's Gender Motivated Violence Act, and the suit argues that sexual assault is a gender-motivated crime. The Gender Motivated Violence Act opened a two-year lookback window on old cases -- hence making the 20-year-old incident viable for a suit. The window closes on February 28, 2025.\n\nIn the past six months, Combs has been sued six times for rape. The first and most publicized suit came from Combs' former partner and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, who sued him in November for sex trafficking and assault. Over the weekend, video footage showed Combs attacking Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. The video prompted an apology from Combs that Cassie did not accept.\n\n\"The gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs,\" Ventura's lawyer told CNN. \"Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light.\"", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Only Ventura's has been settled.\n\nAuthorities searched Diddy's homes on March 25, 2024, because he is a target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security team that handles human trafficking crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe investigation stems from many of the same sexual assault allegations put forth in the civil lawsuits, according to a second law enforcement source familiar with the searches.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Combs led her to the bathroom, where the sexual assault took place, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs led her back to the studio and she lost consciousness, the lawsuit says. She later awakened in a taxi and realized that she had been sexually assaulted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as McKinney has done.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed days after CNN aired a security video that showed Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Combs on Sunday released a video admitting he attacked Cassie in the hotel hallway, saying he was \"truly sorry\" and his actions were \"inexcusable.\"\n\nCombs is not in danger of being criminally prosecuted for the beating because of the statute of limitations. A lawsuit filed by Cassie in November alleging beatings and abuse was settled a day after it was filed. But it spurred intense scrutiny of Combs, with several more lawsuits filed in the following months, along with a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led authorities to raid Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nThe claim on Tuesday was filed under a New York City law that allows accusers to file civil litigation during a limited window even if the events allegedly happened long ago.", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@myfox8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/DiddyAP24143048368264-e1716384889645.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

He said he had sought therapy and entered rehab shortly afterward, and was working to \"be a better man.\"\n\nHe has previously denied all allegations of abuse and wrongdoing and vowed to clear his name.\n\nMcKinney, who was a 22-year-old model at the time of the alleged assault, met Combs at a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in Manhattan, and Combs said she \"was going to make it big one day\" as a model and promised he'd help her career, she said in the suit.\n\nCombs invited her to his studio, where one of his associates offered her a joint of marijuana and said \"you've never had weed like this before,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n\"Plaintiff later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nCombs allegedly pressured McKinney to smoke more and drink alcohol, though she was severely intoxicated, according to the suit.\n\n\"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated, Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" the lawsuit says. Combs then forced her to perform a sex act, she alleges in the suit.\n\nAttorneys for McKinney declined comment Tuesday.\n\nMcKinney in her lawsuit said she was dazed after the alleged sexual assault in the bathroom and passed out in Diddy's studio. She woke up in a taxi and realized she'd been sexually assaulted, she alleges in the suit, which also stated that she saved the clothes she was wearing that night in a plastic bag.\n\nMcKinney said in the lawsuit that after the alleged sexual assault, her modeling opportunities dried up and she believes Combs \"blackballed\" her.\n\nMcKinney \"became severely depressed as she began to blame herself for the assault and for sabotaging her own career,\" the lawsuit says. She even feared retaliation from Combs, according to the suit.\n\nThe suit does not specify a dollar amount, but seeks damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages.\n\nThe suit names Combs, as well as Bad Boy Records and Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing, and Universal Music Group.\n\nUniversal Music Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMcKinney's is the seventh lawsuit filed in recent months against Combs, known for his music career and for founding Bad Boy Records, as well as TV shows like \"Making the Band\" and movie appearances.\n\nEx-girlfriend Cassie Ventura sued Combs in November and alleged rape and abuse, including being punched, stomped and kicked during their relationship. A settlement was reached the following day.\n\nA source familiar with the investigation told NBC News in March that three women and a man had been interviewed by federal officials in Manhattan in relation to allegations of sex trafficking, sexual assault and the solicitation and distribution of illegal narcotics and firearms.\n\nFederal agents searched the rapper's homes in Los Angeles and Miami. Three sources familiar with the matter told NBC News that firearms were found at his residences, but no additional details were provided.\n\nAaron Dyer, one of Combs' attorneys, issued a statement following the searches and said that Combs \"was never detained but spoke to and cooperated with authorities.\" He described the searches as an ambush, saying there's been a rush to judgment based on \"meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits.\"\n\n\"There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations,\" Dyer said. \"Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs",

Mr. Combs invited her to join him in his recording studio later that night.\n\nAccording to the federal complaint filed in New York City, when Ms. McKinney arrived she found Mr. Combs drinking and smoking joints with several other men. She smoked some marijuana, which she \"later came to understand\" was laced with a narcotic or intoxicating substance. She felt as though she was floating. Mr. Combs led her to the bathroom, where the sexual assault took place, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMr. Combs led her back to the studio where she lost consciousness, the lawsuit says. Ms. McKinney awakened in a taxi later in the night, realizing that she had been sexually assaulted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMr. Combs' representatives did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed days after CNN obtained surveillance footage from multiple angles that showed Mr. Combs attacking his former girlfriend R&B singer Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. In the video, he's seen throwing the singer to the ground and then kicking her twice. According to the complaint, Mr. Combs was \"extremely intoxicated.\"\n\nTwo days after the video aired, Mr. Combs released a video admitting he attacked the singer in the hotel hallway.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life,\" he said, calling his behavior \"inexcusable.\" He further mentioned undergoing therapy and rehab. \"I'm not asking for forgiveness; I am truly sorry.\"\n\nThe singer, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, sued Mr. Combs in November over what she said was years of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Though the lawsuit was settled surprisingly fast -- the very next day -- the settlement triggered a series of sexual assault allegations in the following months, prompting Mr. Combs to temporarily step down as chairman of his cable television network, Revolt.\n\nIn March, the music mogul's homes in Los Angeles and Miami were raided by federal agents with Homeland Security investigators, which Mr. Combs' lawyers called \"a gross overuse of military-level force.\"\n\nThree-time Grammy winner Sean John Combs is among the most influential hip-hop producers of the past three decades. In 1993 he established his record label Bad Boy Records and went on the work with numerous top-tier artists including Mary J. Blige, Notorious B.I.G., Usher, Lil Kim, TLC, Faith Evans, and 112. In 1997 he made his debut as a rapper under the name Puff Daddy, which later changed to P. Diddy and then just Diddy.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R&B", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary R&B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usher (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_(TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revolt (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_J._Blige", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary J.

While attending the dinner, during which she alleges that Combs came onto her \"in a sexually suggestive manner,\" she says he invited her to hang out at his recording studio.\n\nAfter arriving at the studio, where McKinney says several other men were present, she claims she was given alcohol and a marijuana joint that she later came to believe was laced \"with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" She says Combs then led her to a bathroom, where he began kissing her without her consent before shoving her head in his crotch and forcing her to perform oral sex over her protests.\n\nMcKinney, who was then working as a professional model, claims that she later \"awakened in shock\" to find herself in a taxi heading back to the apartment of the designer who had invited her to the dinner. At this point, she \"realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\" the complaint reads. The lawsuit adds that following the alleged assault, McKinney's \"modeling opportunities quickly began to dwindle and then evaporated entirely\" after Combs allegedly \"blackballed\" her in the industry. After falling into \"a tailspin of anxiety and depression,\" she claims she attempted suicide in 2004 and later fell into drug and alcohol addiction to cope with the trauma of the alleged assault.\n\nThe new lawsuit was filed under the NYC Gender Motivated Violence Act, which created a two-year lookback window beginning in March 2023 that allows survivors of gender-motivated violence to sue their abusers for alleged incidents that occurred outside the statute of limitations.\n\nAlso named as defendants in the lawsuit are Combs' label Bad Boy Records, its parent company Universal Music Group and Combs' clothing company Sean John Clothing, all of which McKinney claims \"enabled\" the alleged assault by \"actively maintaining and employing Combs in a position of power\" despite the fact that they allegedly \"knew or should have known that Combs posed a risk of sexual assault.\"\n\nMcKinney is asking for damages for mental and emotional injury, distress, pain and suffering and injury to her reputation as well as punitive damages, among other relief.\n\nRepresentatives for Combs, Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing and Universal Music Group did not immediately respond to Billboard's requests for comment.\n\nTuesday's complaint marks the sixth sexual misconduct lawsuit to have been filed against Combs over the past several months. The torrent of lawsuits was kicked off by a November 2023 complaint filed by his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who alleged repeated abuse by the mogul over the course of more than a decade.\n\nThough Ventura's lawsuit was settled just one day later, a 2016 security video published by CNN on Friday (May 17) showed Combs physically assaulting Ventura in a hotel hallway. Though Combs denied all of Ventura's initial allegations, in the wake of the video's release he issued an apology calling his behavior in the clip \"inexcusable.\" L.A. District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n later released a statement saying that Combs could not be prosecuted over the assault due to the statute of limitations.\n\nCombs has strongly denied all allegations of sexual assault made against him. On Dec. 6, he released a statement that read: \"Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\"\n\nIn November, Combs stepped down as chairman of his digital media company Revolt before reportedly selling his stake in the company in March. Also in March, federal agents conducted raids of Combs' L.A. and Miami homes \"in connection\" with a federal sex trafficking investigation, according to CNN.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com",

The ordeal purportedly led to a decline in McKinney's mental health, including \"bouts of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness and intimacy issues.\"\n\nIn recent months, Combs, 54, has faced a series of sexual assault lawsuits alleging he raped or sexually assaulted multiple women over the past few decades. In March, his Los Angeles home was raided by Homeland Security Investigations agents, reportedly in connection with an ongoing sex trafficking investigation in New York.\n\nMcKinney, who is described as a \"woman of faith,\" said she felt a \"moral obligation\" to come forward with her experience after seeing media coverage of Diddy's legal woes.\n\nMcKinney \"prayed to God before bringing this lawsuit, as she feared further violence and/or retaliation from Defendant Combs, but ultimately decided that she needed to speak her truth,\" the lawsuit reads. She \"seeks justice for herself\" and other alleged victims of Combs.\n\nCombs' companies Bad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing and Universal Music Group are also named as defendants in the case.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for McKinney and Combs for comment.\n\nCrystal McKinney details alleged sexual assault by Sean 'Diddy' Combs\n\nIn the lawsuit, McKinney claims she met Combs after being invited to a Men's Fashion Week event at New York City restaurant Cipriani Downtown by an unnamed fashion designer.\n\nDuring the dinner, Combs allegedly \"made a very public display of coming on to (McKinney) in a sexually suggestive manner\" and plied McKinney with alcohol \"as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\"\n\nPer McKinney's filing, the music mogul also told the model he was going to help advance her career and gave McKinney his phone number \"as a gesture of good faith.\" McKinney won MTV's Model Mission contest in 1998 and had previously modeled for Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nCombs invited McKinney to visit his studio later that night, according to the lawsuit, where she smoked marijuana with the \"Hello Good Morning\" rapper and his associates. McKinney alleges the marijuana joint \"felt very powerful\" and that it had been laced with \"a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nShortly afterward, Combs allegedly led McKinney to the bathroom, the filing states. After forcing himself onto the model and \"kissing her without her consent,\" McKinney claims Combs \"shoved her head down to his crotch\" and forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nFollowing the alleged assault, McKinney began to feel increasingly \"woozy\" and subsequently lost consciousness, per the complaint. The model later awoke inside a taxicab that drove her back to the fashion designer's apartment.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [],

She's previously worked at iHeartMedia, IndieWire, and REVOLT.\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs has been accused of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman in a new lawsuit filed in New York.\n\nIn court documents obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday, May 21, Crystal McKinney alleges that she was 22 years old when she was introduced to the mogul, now 54, by a designer while working as a model back in 2003.\n\nIn the lawsuit, McKinney claims that after meeting with Combs and the unnamed designer at Cipriani Downtown, that she \"felt little control over the events as she was directed what to do and put on display, for the others in attendance.\"\n\nMcKinney claimed that she was instructed to sit \"directly across from Combs\" at the event and that he \"made a very public display of coming on to [her] in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner.\"\n\nShe added the Bad Boy CEO continuously complimented her \"beauty\" and told her she \"was going to make it big one day\" as a model. She claims he told her that \"he had power in the industry and was going to help her advance her career\" before they exchanged phone numbers.\n\nIn the lawsuit, McKinney described Combs as \"flirtatious\" during the course of the evening and alleges that he \"plied Plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\"\n\nLater that night at Combs' studio, the model says she was offered weed, and alleges she \"later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance,\" per the lawsuit.\n\nShe claims she declined to smoke or drink after feeling as though she was \"floating,\" but Combs called her \"uptight\" and continued pressuring her to do so.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Combs then led McKinney to a bathroom where he began forcing himself upon her and kissing her without her consent. He then allegedly shoved her head down to his crotch and forced her to perform oral sex on him. She claimed that once the act was over, Combs went back into the studio. McKinney says she began feeling \"physically sick\" and \"lost consciousness.\"\n\nMcKinney also claims Combs \"blackballed\" her career, and around 2004 she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt after \"she began to blame herself for the assault and for sabotaging her own career.\"\n\n\"Due to the traumatic events to occur later, Plaintiff (McKinney) saved the unwashed clothing from that night in her closet where they remain in a plastic wrap,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nThe amount she is seeking in damages is unspecified.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nReps for Combs did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment. McKinney's lawyers declined to comment.\n\nTuesday's lawsuit comes less than a week after CNN released footage of Combs kicking, punching and dragging his former girlfriend and former Bad Boy artist Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. The incident was captured on the hotel's surveillance cameras.\n\nIn addition to Ventura and McKinney, Diddy faces sexual assault/harassment lawsuits from three other women and one man.", "source":

McKinney claimed the rapper said he'd help her modeling career and invited her to his studio, according to the lawsuit HuffPost obtained.\n\nAt the studio, McKinney recalled joining Combs and other people in his orbit for drinks and marijuana, specifically a joint that \"felt very powerful.\"\n\nShe realized soon after that Combs \"had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance,\" the lawsuit continued.\n\n\"Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him, and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" where he kissed her against her will and forced her to perform oral sex, according to the suit.\n\nMcKinney alleges that she passed out afterward and later woke up in a taxi, realizing that she was sexually assaulted. (The suit does not clarify if she is referring to the aforementioned sexual assault or another instance that occurred when she was unconscious.)\n\nFollowing the assault, McKinney claims that Combs \"blackballed\" her and \"utilized his significant influence to impede Plaintiff's career growth.\"\n\nShe then \"became severely depressed as she began to blame herself for the assault and for sabotaging her own career,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe seeks damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages through a jury trial. Bad Boy Entertainment, Universal Music Entertainment Group and Sean John Clothing are also defendants in the suit.\n\nMcKinney said she \"knew she had a moral obligation to speak up\" following a spate of lawsuits against Combs in which he is accused of sexual abuse and violence.\n\nMost recently, CNN published a harrowing video Friday that put on display Combs' domestic violence against his ex, Cassie Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016, adding to the singer's claims of abuse and rape in a quickly settled lawsuit from November.\n\nThe video of the abuse prompted a response from Combs in which he said he \"fucked up.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I mean, I hit rock bottom.

McKinney alleges that she was assaulted at his studio, according to TMZ. She is seeking unspecified damages for the sexual assaults. This lawsuit comes just days after Diddy broke his silence after a shocking video surfaced last week showing him beating up his former girlfriend Cassie.\n\nDiddy's Sexual Assault Victim\n\nMcKinney says that she was 22 when she was invited to a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in New York City. There, she met Diddy, who then invited her to his studio.\n\nMcKinney claims that during a 2003 encounter, the rapper plied her with alcohol and possibly laced marijuana. She alleges that he then took her to a bathroom, forced her to her knees, and demanded she perform oral sex, saying, \"Suck it,\" according to the lawsuit obtained by TMZ.\n\nWhen she refused, he allegedly pushed her head down and forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nAfterward, as she tried to walk away, she felt dizzy and eventually lost consciousness. She later woke up in a taxi and realized she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nIt's unclear whether she is referencing the incident in the bathroom or another assault that may have occurred while she was unconscious.\n\nMcKinney claims that she was then blackballed from the modeling industry, fell into a severe depression, and attempted suicide in 2004.\n\nShe says that after seeing lawsuits filed against Diddy by his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and other women, she felt a moral obligation to speak up.\n\nMore Trouble for Diddy\n\nIn April, Combs' mansions in Florida and California were raided by a Department of Homeland Security team specializing in human trafficking following allegations against him.\n\nCombs apologized on Sunday after footage emerged showing him viciously beating Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016 despite initially denying all allegations.\n\nIn the clip, Ventura is seen trying to enter an elevator before Combs, clad only in a towel, appears from around a corner, grabs her by the neck, and throws her to the ground.\n\nHe then kicks her several times before pulling her up and throwing her back around the corner. Later, he is seen hurling objects at Ventura while aggressively yelling at her.\n\nThe footage matches a vivid description of the assault Ventura detailed in her November filing against Combs, which was settled out of court with Combs maintaining his innocence.

Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, according to the federal complaint filed in New York City.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that McKinney arrived to find Combs drinking and smoking marijuana with several other men. She smoked some marijuana, which she \"later came to understand\" was laced with a narcotic or intoxicating substance, the lawsuit says.\n\nShe alleges that Combs led her to the bathroom where she was forced to perform oral sex on him.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Combs' representatives for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed days after the release of footage showing Combs attacking singer Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. On Sunday (26 May), Combs posted a video admitting that he attacked Ventura, saying he was \"truly sorry\" and his actions were \"inexcusable\".\n\nA lawsuit filed by Ventura in November alleging beatings and abuse was settled a day after it was filed, but Combs is currently facing a string of different civil lawsuits, which have accused him of sex trafficking, sexual abuse and rape. Combs has vehemently denied those allegations against him, while his lawyers have branded the lawsuits and their accusations as money grabs, \"baseless\" or \"sickening\". The musician has not been formally charged.\n\nThe claim on Tuesday was filed under a New York City law that allows accusers to file civil litigation during a limited window even if the alleged events happened long ago.\n\nRape Crisis offers support for those affected by rape and sexual abuse.

It is the seventh in a string of lawsuits against the Bad Boy Records founder in recent months.\n\nMcKinney's lawsuit was filed in a federal court in New York CIty on Tuesday, just days after a video emerged of Combs beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016. Ventura's lawsuit was settled within a day of her filing, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAccording to the complaint, McKinney was a 22-year-old model when she met Combs at a Manhattan fashion event. He said she was \"going to make it big one day,\" promised to help her career, and invited her to his studio, where one of his associates offered her marijuana.\n\n\"Plaintiff later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance,\" the complaint says.\n\nOnce McKinney was \"very intoxicated\" by marijuana and alcohol, Combs allegedly took her to a bathroom and forced her to perform a sex act.

Per TMZ and Rolling Stone, former model Crystal McKinney has filed a lawsuit claiming that Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her at his recording studio in 2003 when she was 22. (Per the New York Times, the lawsuit is being brought under New York City's Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Act, which allows complaints to be filed in a certain window after the statute of limitations has passed.) According to McKinney, an unnamed designer inviting her to dinner with Combs during Men's Fashion Week in New York City. She recalls Combs asking her to go to his Manhattan studio that night, which she felt would be safe since it was a professional environment. However, once there, she claims that Combs gave her a joint that she believes was laced with a narcotic. Allegedly, he then led her to a bathroom where he kissed her without consent, pushed her head down, and forced her to perform oral sex on him. McKinney recalls passing out shortly after and waking up in a cab to realize that she had been sexually assaulted. Representatives for Combs did not immediately respond to Vulture's request for comment.\n\nCassie Ventura, Combs's ex-girlfriend and former signee to his label, filed a lawsuit against him last year. Though that case was settled after one day, it was followed by several other legal claims of sexual misconduct and illegal behavior against the music mogul. Combs has consistently denied the allegations against him and instead suggested that his accusers are looking to make money. However, he did recently release an apology after graphic footage showed him assaulting Ventura in a hotel in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_zhan@vulture.com", "name": "Jennifer Zhan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulture (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b60/23c/7a3734ac07842fdf200bd6ad1d27737e8e-diddy.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

One of the rapper's friends also allegedly raped her afterward.\n\nThen in December, Combs was accused of gang-raping and sex-trafficking a 17-year-old schoolgirl when she was in the 11th grade.\n\nIn February, the music mogul's former producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones filed a lawsuit against him, claiming he had \"HUNDREDS of hours of footage and audio recordings of Mr. Combs, his staff and his guests engaging in serious illegal activity.\"\n\nJones alleged that Diddy repeatedly sexually assaulted him while he was working on his latest album from September 2022 to November 2023.\n\nDuring that time, Combs would allegedly grope Jones' genitals and touch his anus to groom him into having sex -- which he claimed the rapper downplayed as \"horseplay.\"\n\nAlmost exactly a month after Jones filed his suit, Combs home was raided by the feds in connection to a sex trafficking investigation.\n\nCombs has vehemently denied the accusations.\n\nReps for Combs did not immediately respond to Page Six's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Page Six"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'll_Be_Missing_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "I'll Be Missing You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delirium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/82376746.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

She claims the joint had been laced with a narcotic or another drug.\n\nMcKinney said Combs then demanded she follow him to the bathroom, where she claims he then forced himself on her, kissing her and shoving her head down to his crotch before commanding her to \"suck it\", the TMZ report says.\n\nIt added that despite her refusal, Combs then forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nMcKinney claims in the suit that she started walking away but then felt woozy and lost consciousness. She said the next time she woke, she was in a taxi and realised she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nThe TMZ report said it is unclear from the lawsuit if the sexual assault referred to was the alleged forced oral sex or another sexual act while she was unconscious.\n\nAccording to McKinney, she was subsequently blackballed from the modelling industry, fell into severe depressed and attempted suicide in 2004, TMZ said.\n\nSeeking unspecified damages, McKinney said she \"knew she had a moral obligation to speak up\" after seeing lawsuits filed by Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura and others, TMZ reported.\n\nJust last Friday, video footage circulated on social media depicting Combs beating and dragging Ventura at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles on March 5, 2016.\n\nIn the video, Ventura appears to be exiting a hotel room before Combs, holding a towel around his waist, runs after her. It then showed him violently grabbing her by the back of the neck and throwing her to the ground. He then kicked her as she remained motionless on the floor before dragging her by her sweatshirt toward the room.\n\nREAD: Video appears to show Diddy beating, dragging Cassie\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said it was unable to charge Combs for the incident as the conduct depicted in the 2016 video would have occurred beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted.\n\nHowever, Combs on Sunday apologised saying, \"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life...sometimes you gotta do that. I was f*cked up. I mean I hit rock bottom and I make no excuses. My behaviour on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted.

Wigdor, alleges, the video is one of many cases currently against the musical mogul. \"The gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behaviour of Mr Combs,\" Wigdor remarked.\n\nMore ongoing cases against Diddy include further allegations from Ventura, who claims Diddy subjected her to years of abuse, including rape and beatings. Another woman has alleged Diddy and two other men raped her when she was 17 in 2003. Additionally, in February, a music producer sued Combs, stating he sexually assaulted him and forced him to have sex with prostitutes. Diddy denies all the allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nNow, Diddy faces a new lawsuit that former model Crystal McKinney has filed. McKinney alleges that she was forced to perform oral sex on him at his recording studio.\n\nMcKinney, 22 at the time, states that she met Combs at a Men's Fashion Week event in a Manhattan restaurant. Her case states, as per The Guardian, \"Once seated, Combs made a very public display of coming on to plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner... Throughout their interactions, Combs was flirtatious, bordering on leering, as he leaned across the table towards her. Combs also piled plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\"\n\nMcKinney then alleges that she was invited back to Combs recording studio, where he gave her marijuana and alcohol that she now thinks might have been laced with a narcotic. Afterwards, he led her to the bathroom, where he kissed her without consent before forcing her to perform oral sex on him. McKinney states she then passed out and woke up in a taxi, realising she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nAs of yet, Diddy is yet to respond to the claims made by McKinney and the new lawsuit.\n\nThis is a developing story.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dale_maplethorpe@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Dale Maplethorpe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/02/Sean-'Diddy-Combs-2023-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Already having been given quite a bit to drink, the plaintiff says she was encouraged to partake of some \"very powerful\" pot by Diddy - something several other accusers have detailed as an M.O. of the Bad Boys Entertainment founder.\n\n\"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated, Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" the suit details. After McKinney initially refused to perform fellatio on Combs, the rapper \"shoved her head down to his crotch\" and forced her to give him oral sex.\n\nMcKinney asserts that she passed out soon afterwards only to regain consciousness in the back of cab later.\n\nRepresentatives for the much accused and much sued Combs did not respond to request from Deadline for comment on McKinney's suit. If and when they do, this post will be updated.\n\nCalling herself a \"woman of faith,\" McKinney explains in the filing that she felt she had a \"moral obligation\" to make her encounter with Combs public after so many other women have alleged the mogul attacked them over the years.\n\nFirst reported by TMZ, McKinney's action is seeking a wide range of unspecified damages. While the more than 20 year old claims would usually be dead due to the statute of limitations, the former model is moving forward under the Big Apple's Victims of Gender Motivated Violence Act, which permits the filing of civil suits under an extended timeline.\n\nMuch sued, Combs has not been charged by any jurisdiction, yet. Not even with the indisputable video evidence of his beating of Venura eight years ago in the City of Angels.\n\n\"We are aware of the video that has been circulating online allegedly depicting Sean Combs assaulting a young woman in Los Angeles\" George Gasc\u00f3n said late on May 17, a few hours after CNN's exclusive of the horrific hallway assault of Ventura by Combs at Century City's now-closed InterContinental Hotel dropped.\n\nSince Ventura filed her quickly settled suit on November 16, 2023, half a dozen other legal actions have been filed accusing Combs of sexual assault and other misconduct. At least one of those filings alleges sex trafficking of a minor, and another is from a producer on Combs' most recent album.\n\nCombs has denied all claims -- even though he later corrected himself with a video apology for the beating of Ventura in 2016 in an LA hotel, once the video went wide.\n\nHowever, on March 25 this year, the FBI and Homeland Security agents raided his LA and Miami homes. A federal spokesperson called the raids part of an \"ongoing investigation.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He's now facing 5 suits.", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe suit, filed in New York's Southern District Court, alleged Combs had been \"coming on to plaintiff in a sexually suggestive manner\" at the restaurant they were dining at.\n\n\"Combs also plied plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine,\" the suit said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, McKinney was invited back to Combs' recording studio and given what she believed to be laced marijuana. The suit alleged that Combs began kissing her nonconsensually and pointed to his crotch, asking that she \"suck it.\" After she refused, Combs shoved her head down to force her to perform oral sex on him, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, she became unconscious and later woke up in a cab.\n\nMcKinney is suing Combs under the NYC Victims Of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act, a city law that allows for civil suits to be filed within a two-year look-back period, and she is asking for a jury trial. She is seeking an unspecified amount of damages for \"mental and emotional injury, distress, pain and suffering and injury to her reputation.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Combs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAttorneys for McKinney declined to comment.\n\nCombs faces lawsuits from four other people: a former employee and three women have accused Combs of sexual assault, abuse, drugging, and other acts of sexual misconduct. One woman said in her suit filed in December that Combs \"sex trafficked and gang raped\" her as a 17-year-old in 2003.\n\nCombs denied the previous allegations on Instagram and declared he would \"fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\"\n\n\"For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,\" he said. \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday.\"\n\nA sixth lawsuit, filed in November by Comb's ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, accused the mogul of rape and abuse while they were together for over a decade. The two parties settled the lawsuit a day after it was filed, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Friday, CNN published 2016 surveillance footage that appeared to show Combs assaulting Ventura in a Los Angeles Hotel. Combs later released an apology, calling his actions \"inexcusable\" -- though he didn't specify which actions he was apologizing for, nor did he mention Ventura's name.\n\nOn March 25, the Department of Homeland Security raided Combs' Los Angeles and Miami homes. He has not been charged with any crime related to that raid.\n\nIn a previous statement to Business Insider, Aaron Dyer, a lawyer for Combs, called the search a \"gross overuse of military-level force.\"\n\n\"There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations,\" Dyer said. \"Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_getahun@businessinsider.com", "name": "Hannah Getahun", "type":

The ordeal purportedly led to a decline in McKinney's mental health, including \"bouts of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness and intimacy issues.\"\n\nIn recent months, Combs, 54, has faced a series of sexual assault lawsuits alleging he raped or sexually assaulted multiple women over the past few decades. In March, his Los Angeles home was raided by Homeland Security Investigations agents, reportedly in connection with an ongoing sex trafficking investigation in New York.\n\nMcKinney, who is described as a \"woman of faith,\" said she felt a \"moral obligation\" to come forward with her experience after seeing media coverage of Diddy's legal woes.\n\nMcKinney \"prayed to God before bringing this lawsuit, as she feared further violence and/or retaliation from Defendant Combs, but ultimately decided that she needed to speak her truth,\" the lawsuit reads. She \"seeks justice for herself\" and other alleged victims of Combs.\n\nCombs' companies Bad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing and Universal Music Group are also named as defendants in the case.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for McKinney and Combs for comment.\n\nIn the lawsuit, McKinney claims she met Combs after being invited to a Men's Fashion Week event at New York City restaurant Cipriani Downtown by an unnamed fashion designer.\n\nDuring the dinner, Combs allegedly \"made a very public display of coming on to (McKinney) in a sexually suggestive manner\" and plied McKinney with alcohol \"as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\"\n\nPer McKinney's filing, the music mogul also told the model he was going to help advance her career and gave McKinney his phone number \"as a gesture of good faith.\" McKinney won MTV's Model Mission contest in 1998 and had previously modeled for Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nCombs invited McKinney to visit his studio later that night, according to the lawsuit, where she smoked marijuana with the \"Hello Good Morning\" rapper and his associates. McKinney alleges the marijuana joint \"felt very powerful\" and that it had been laced with \"a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nShortly afterward, Combs allegedly led McKinney to the bathroom, the filing states. After forcing himself onto the model and \"kissing her without her consent,\" McKinney claims Combs \"shoved her head down to his crotch\" and forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nFollowing the alleged assault, McKinney began to feel increasingly \"woozy\" and subsequently lost consciousness, per the complaint. The model later awoke inside a taxicab that drove her back to the fashion designer's apartment.\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe, USA TODAY", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Today, former model Crystal McKinney filed a lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of forcing her to perform oral sex on him at his New York City recording studio in 2003.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the complaint claims that McKinney was 22 when an unnamed fashion designer invited her to attend a Men's Fashion Week event at a Manhattan restaurant. She met Combs there, and he invited her into his recording studio later that evening. She was given alcohol and marijuana that she later believed was laced. Combs allegedly led her to the bathroom and shoved her head down to his crotch. After she refused, he forced her to perform oral sex on him. The lawsuit says she lost consciousness shortly after, and later awakened in a cab and realized that she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nMcKinney is the sixth person to come forward with allegations against Combs. In November of last year, Cassie sued him for sexual abuse and the case was settled within two days.

Model's Lawsuit Accuses Diddy of Sexual Assault", "body": "Gabby Petito's Texts Show 'More and More Tension' With Brian Laundrie\n\nLess than a week after video footage of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs assaulting his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura became public on May 17, 2024, another woman has come forward and filed a lawsuit against the \"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems\" artist. The filing comes from former model Crystal McKinney, who has accused Combs of drugging and sexually assaulting her in New York City in 2003.\n\nAfter winning a modeling competition on MTV, McKinney was awarded a contract with IMG in 1998. From there, the Savannah, Georgia, native went on to book modeling campaigns with brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Elle, Cosmopolitan and more.\n\nMcKinney becomes the fifth person to file a lawsuit against the Bad Boy Entertainment founder since November 2023. In documents obtained by In Touch, McKinney claims she was 22 when she met Combs in 2003 after an unnamed fashion designer invited her to attend a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani.\n\nAccording to the court documents, the fashion designer told McKinney \"that he would be introducing her to Combs which could advance her modeling career.\" When McKinney and the fashion designer arrived at dinner to meet Combs, she sat beside the fashion designer. However, Combs insisted that she sit directly across from him.\n\nMcKinney claimed that Combs \"made a very public display of coming on to [her] in a sexually suggestive manner.\" The \"All About the Benjamins\" rapper allegedly told McKinney that she was \"going to make it big one day\" and plied her with alcohol throughout dinner.\n\nMcKinney claimed that Combs asked her to visit him at his studio later that night, which she did. When she arrived, she alleged that the group of men inside, including Combs, were passing around a bottle of Hennessy and smoking marijuana. Despite allegedly telling Combs that she'd had enough, McKinney claimed that Combs \"pressured her to imbibe more alcohol and marijuana by telling her that she was acting too uptight.\"\n\nMcKinney claimed that Combs then \"physically led\" her to a bathroom where he began kissing her without his consent and forced her to perform oral sex on him. She claimed that when she and Combs returned to the studio, she lost consciousness.\n\nMcKinney claimed that after the events of the night in the studio, she noticed that her \"modeling opportunities quickly began to dwindle and then evaporated entirely.\" She alleged that Combs \"blackballed\" her in the modeling and entertainment industry, which sent her into a downward spiral of depression and anxiety.", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "whitney_danhauer@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Whitney Danhauer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Money_Mo_Problems", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mo Money Mo Problems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMG_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IMG (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hilfiger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Hilfiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Touch_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In Touch Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosmopolitan (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennessy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hennessy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Who-Is-Crystal-McKinney-Model-Sues-Diddy-for-Sexual-Assault-03.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 191, "textEnd": 197}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

At one point, the producer told McKinney that she \"was going to make it big one day\" as a model.\n\nRepresentatives for Combs did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. McKinney's representatives declined to comment.\n\nSEAN 'DIDDY' COMBS' FEDERAL RAIDS ON HOMES, SEXUAL MISCONDUCT LAWSUITS: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nShe described in detail what she wore the night of the alleged incident, which included \"a black leather coat with a fur hood, a translucent chiffon beige v-cut shirt, fur-lined handbag, and jewel encrusted jeans\" handpicked by the designer for McKinney to wear to the event.\n\n\"Due to the traumatic events to occur later, Plaintiff saved the unwashed clothing from that night in her closet where they remain in a plastic wrap,\" the complaint said.\n\nCombs allegedly \"plied Plaintiff with alcohol throughout the dinner as he repeatedly refilled her glass with wine.\" After the meal, Combs allegedly asked McKinney to meet him at his studio on 44th Street, and she felt \"reassured that she would be with others at the studio rather alone in a personal residence.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nUpon arriving, she found Combs with several other men passing around \"a bottle of Hennesy and joints.\"\n\n\"One of Combs' associates asked her, 'Do you smoke weed?' to which she responded affirmatively,\" documents stated. \"Combs' associate replied: 'You've never had weed like this before.'\"\n\nThe complaint stated that \"Plaintiff later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" McKinney said she felt \"pressured\" to imbibe by Combs, who told her that she was \"acting too uptight.\"\n\n\"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated, Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" the suit stated. \"In the bathroom, Combs forced himself on Plaintiff and began kissing her without her consent.\" He allegedly forced McKinney to \"perform oral sex on him.\"\n\nMcKinney allegedly \"lost consciousness\" and awoke in shock to find herself in a taxicab heading back to the designer's apartment.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nShe noted that modeling opportunities \"quickly began to dwindle and then evaporated entirely\" following the alleged assault. McKinney believed that Combs \"blackballed\" her in the industry.\n\n\"The assault led Plaintiff into a tailspin of anxiety and depression,\" the suit claimed. \"In or about 2004, Plaintiff attempted suicide and was hospitalized.\" She claimed to experience alcohol and drug addiction in an attempt to cope \"with the emotional trauma of being assaulted.\"\n\nOnly after other women came forward with their own stories of alleged assaults at the hands of Combs was when McKinney felt comfortable speaking on her own, according to the complaint.\n\nCombs is also being sued by Liza Gardner, Jane Doe, Joi Dickerson-Neal and music producer Rodeny \"Lil Rod\" Jones. Combs has denied each of the claims.\n\n\"Plaintiff is a woman of faith and when she saw news coverage of the lawsuits from Ms. Cassie Ventura, Ms. Dickerson-Neal, and others, she knew she had a moral obligation to speak up,\" documents stated. \"Plaintiff prayed to G-d before bringing this lawsuit, as she feared further violence and/or retaliation from Defendant Combs, but ultimately decided that she needed to speak her truth.\"\n\nIn a video from eight years ago and only recently obtained exclusively by CNN, Combs was seen running down a hotel hallway wearing a towel. Moments before, Cassie (Cassandra Ventura) had walked down the same hallway with bags in her hand toward the elevators.\n\nWATCH: SEAN 'DIDDY' COMBS ASSAULTS CASSIE IN 2016 LOS ANGELES HOTEL INCIDENT\n\nOnce Combs reached the elevators, he grabbed Cassie by the neck and threw her to the ground. Combs then kicked her twice, picked up her bags and dragged her back down the hallway before she returned to the same area to use a phone.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that. I was f---ed up -- I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses,\" Combs said in a clip shared Sunday. \"My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.\"\n\nCombs admitted, \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nCassie accused Combs of rape and years of abuse in a bombshell lawsuit filed in November, but one day later, the former couple settled the suit for an undisclosed sum.\n\nHer team fired back at the apology and claimed Combs' statement appeared to be more \"about himself than the many people he has hurt.\"\n\n\"When Cassie and other multiple women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday,\" Meredith Firetog, a partner at Wigdor LLP, the legal firm representing Ventura, told Fox News Digital. \"That he was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

She later awakened in a taxi and realized that she had been sexually assaulted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs' representatives did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as McKinney has done.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed days after CNN aired security video that shows Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Combs on Sunday released a video admitting he attacked Cassie in the hotel hallway, saying he was \"truly sorry\" and his actions were \"inexcusable.\"\n\nCombs is not in danger of being criminally prosecuted for the beating because of the statute of limitations.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Cassie in November alleging beatings and abuse was settled a day after it was filed. But it spurred intense scrutiny of Combs, with several more lawsuits filed in the following months, along with a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led authorities to raid Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nThe claim on Tuesday was filed under a New York City law that allows accusers to file civil litigation during a limited window even if the events allegedly happened long ago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Bad Boy CEO, too, assured the then 22-year-old model that 'he had power in the industry' to help her get ahead in her career. The suit highlighted sexually-inviting gestures and 'flirtatious' remarks from Combs' which ended up building up to a further invitation to his studio, to 'get to know her better.'\n\nCombs and an associate then allegedly pressured her to smoke weed and drink to later take advantage of McKinney. Combs asked her to join him in the bathroom where he 'began kissing her without her consent' and forced her to perform an intimate act on him. She recalls passing out and later waking up in a cab on her way home.\n\nPeople also highlighted from the legal documents that McKinney mentions getting 'blackballed' in the fashion industry after that incident and being hospitalised for a suicide attempt in 2004. McKinney saved the unwashed clothing from that night in her closet and wrapped them in a plastic sheet.\n\nMcKinney, one of six accusers, has sought coverage of attorneys' fees and costs besides compensatory and punitive damages.

The former model claimed the joint was \"very powerful\", as if she was floating, leading her to suspect it was laced with a narcotic.\n\nAfterwards, she claimed Diddy demanded she follow him to the bathroom, where she alleged he kissed her and initiated oral sex forcibly, despite McKinney refusing. The lawsuit states McKinney tried to walk away, but lost consciousness.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, she then woke up in a taxi, realising she had been sexually assaulted. The lawsuit does not make clear whether her realisation stemmed from the alleged forced oral sex or from another sex act that might have occurred when McKinney was passed out.\n\nMcKinney claimed she was blackballed from the industry, leading to severe depression and a later suicide attempt in 2004. She is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. NME have contacted Diddy's representatives for comment.\n\nThe new allegations from McKinney are the latest in a wave of lawsuits against the rapper. Last November, R&B singer and ex-partner Cassie Ventura filed a lawsuit against Diddy for physical and sexual abuse. The two settled the lawsuit \"to mutual satisfaction\" a day after the case was filed, according to a release sent by attorney Douglas Wigdor, who represented Ventura.\n\nA video has since been obtained and published by CNN on May 17 that shows Diddy allegedly attacking Cassie in a hotel. The footage seems to align with allegations Ventura made in her lawsuit against Diddy. He has since apologised for his \"inexcusable\" behaviour in the video.\n\nA week later, two new allegations were made against Diddy; one claimed Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her and the other alleged that Combs and singer-songwriter Aaron Hall took turns raping the plaintiff and her friend in 1990 or 1991 - adding that Diddy turned violent days later. Diddy went online to deny all allegations against him, but Hall hasn't replied to the accusations.\n\nEarlier this year, producer Rodney 'Lil Rod' Jones sued Combs alleging he sexually assaulted him, had parties where sex workers and underage girls were present, and coerced him to sleep with prostitutes. Diddy replied, saying Jones' claims were \"pure fiction\".\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs continues to deny any wrongdoing.\n\nBack in March, Diddy's homes in Miami and LA were raided by US Homeland Security regarding a multi-state sex trafficking investigation. At the time, a representative for Combs said the \"unprecedented ambush\" was an \"excessive show of force and hostility\". They added, \"Mr Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos,

Not even a week after his 2016 video showing him bashing and beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura went viral, a model has sued the Bad Boy record producer with severe charges. In a lawsuit filed this week, model Crystal McKinney alleges she was drugged and sexually assaulted by Combs back in 2003. This is the sixth sexual assault accusation levied against Combs in the past six months.\n\nOn Tuesday, former model McKinney made a claim that back in 2003 when she was just 22 years old, the rapper forced her to perform oral sex on him after drugging her during her visit to his NYC recording studio. The suit, obtained by TMZ, details a disturbing event where McKinney alleges she was invited to a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in NYC, where she met Combs.

In her suit, the model alleges how Combs and several of his colleagues were drinking beer and passing around joints. \"She took a hit, which she described as \"very powerful.\"\n\nMcKinney told in her suit, as per TMZ that the joint \"looked like it was laced with some kind of drug.\" The model went on to describe how the ex-Revolt CEO \"invited her to go to the bathroom with him, where he forced her to perform oral sex on him,\" according to the suit. She tried to resist, but she was forced to perform certain acts, the suit states. Next thing she remembers, she woke up in a cab and realised she had been been sexually assaulted. After the incident, devastated McKinney even tried taking her own life and attempted suicide in 2004, as detailed in the chargesheet.\n\nAlso read: Prince Harry 'ready to forgive' Royal family but 'tables have turned' as King and William are...\n\nFor those unaware, back in April, Combs' LA and Miami mansions were raided by Homeland Security in connection with alleged sex trafficking charges. Since then, the rapper has been under constant scrutiny by federal authorities. However, he recently addressed how everyone had been slamming him with false claims until a video from 2016 emerged showing him assaulting his then-girlfriend. According to Cassie, Combs paid a significant sum to the hotel owner to prevent the clip from being leaked at the time. The footage aligned with a detailed description of the assault she provided in her November filing against Combs, which was settled outside of court the day after it was filed.", "source": {"uri":

According to court documents acquired by PEOPLE on May 21, Crystal McKinney asserts that she was 22 years old when she was introduced to the mogul, now 54, by a designer while pursuing a career as a model in 2003.\n\nWithin the legal complaint, McKinney alleges that following a meeting with Combs and the unidentified designer at Cipriani Downtown, she experienced a loss of agency, feeling directed and put on display for others present.\n\nMcKinney asserted that she was directed to sit \"directly across from Combs\" during the event, where he publicly displayed sexually suggestive behavior towards her throughout the dinner. She stated that the Bad Boy CEO continuously praised her \"beauty\" and predicted her future success as a model. Allegedly, Combs claimed to wield industry power and offered assistance in advancing her career, exchanging phone numbers with her. In the lawsuit, McKinney described Combs as \"flirtatious\" throughout the evening and claimed he continuously replenished her wine glass, plying her with alcohol.\n\nAfterward, at Combs' studio, the model asserts she was presented with marijuana and alleges that she \"subsequently realized that Combs had spiked the joint with a narcotic or another intoxicating substance,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe states that she refused to smoke or drink after experiencing sensations of being \"detached,\" but Combs labeled her as \"uptight\" and persisted in pressuring her to partake.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Combs later took McKinney to a bathroom where he kissed her without her consent. She claimed that once the act finished, Combs was back into the studio. McKinney said she felt \"physically sick\" and \"lost consciousness.\"\n\nMcKinney further alleges that Combs effectively sabotaged her career, resulting in her being \"blackballed.\" Around 2004, she asserts she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt, as she began to internalize blame for the assault and the subsequent derailment of her career.\n\n\"Due to the traumatic events to occur later, Plaintiff (McKinney) saved the unwashed clothing from that night in her closet where they remain in a plastic wrap,\" the lawsuit says.", "source": {"uri": "screenbox.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenBox"}, "authors": [{"uri": "divya_pal@screenbox.in", "name": "Divya Pal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://screenbox.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sean-diddy-combs-news-jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 51, "textEnd": 57, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Mr. Combs has not yet responded.\n\nA former model filed a lawsuit on Tuesday accusing the hip-hop mogul Sean Combs of forcing her to perform oral sex on him at his New York City recording studio in 2003.\n\nIn the complaint, Crystal McKinney says that when she was 22, an unnamed fashion designer invited her to attend a Men's Fashion Week event at a restaurant in Manhattan, where she met Mr. Combs, who was a well-known record label impresario and host of the MTV reality show \"Making the Band.\"\n\nLater that night, according to the lawsuit, Mr. Combs invited her to his recording studio, where Ms. McKinney says she was given alcohol and marijuana that she later came to believe was laced. She says Mr. Combs led her to the bathroom, shoved her head down to his crotch and, after she refused, forced her to perform oral sex on him. Soon after, the lawsuit says, she lost consciousness, later awakening in a cab and realizing that she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nRepresentatives for Mr. Combs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nMr. Combs, 54, has been facing deepening legal troubles since his former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, filed a lawsuit against him last year in which she accused him of sexually and physically abusing her for years. The lawsuit was settled in one day, but three more suits followed from women who accused him of rape. In March, two of Mr. Combs's homes were raided as part of an investigation that officials said is at least in part a human trafficking inquiry.\n\nThe producer and businessman, who is known as Puff Daddy and Diddy, has called the allegations against him false and \"sickening,\" and he has described the plaintiffs as looking for a \"a quick payday.\"\n\nMr. Combs's conduct has come under intense scrutiny in recent days after CNN published footage from 2016 in which he is seen striking, kicking and dragging Ms. Ventura, corroborating part of her lawsuit filed last year. On Sunday, he apologized, saying in a video posted to Instagram, \"My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\"\n\nMs. McKinney, who filed her lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said learning of the other lawsuits against Mr. Combs led her to file her own. Because the allegations are more than two decades old, which is outside the statute of limitations, the lawsuit is bringing the claim under New York City's Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Act, which, for a limited period of time, allows accusers to file civil complaints involving claims after the statute of limitations has run out.\n\nA lawyer representing Mr. Combs, Jonathan Davis, argued in a separate assault lawsuit that the gender violence act should not be used to allow such suits to go forward because another state law specifically extending the statute of limitations for sexual assault had expired.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type":

Per the lawsuit, she was invited to his studio where she was given alcohol and a potent strain of marijuana. \"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated...Combs physically led her to the bathroom...and shoved her head down to his crotch...forcing her to give him oral sex.\" Following the incident, McKinney claims she lost consciousness and later woke up in the back of a cab.\n\nDespite the allegations being over 20 years old, McKinney is proceeding with her lawsuit under the provisions of New York's Victims of Gender Motivated Violence Act. This law allows for an extended timeline for filing civil suits. McKinney has expressed a sense of \"moral duty\" to make her encounter with Combs public, especially in light of numerous similar accusations against him. She is seeking unspecified damages in her suit. Representatives for Combs have not yet responded to the lawsuit.\n\nCombs has been the subject of multiple lawsuits but hasn't been formally charged by any jurisdiction. This includes an incident involving video evidence of him assaulting Ventura eight years ago. Since Ventura filed her suit in November 2023, six other legal actions have been filed accusing Combs of sexual assault and other misconduct. Despite these allegations, Combs has consistently denied all claims, although he did issue a video apology for the assault on Ventura after the video was made public.\n\n\"We are aware of the video allegedly showing Sean Combs assaulting a young woman in Los Angeles,\" said LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n last week. However, Gasc\u00f3n acknowledged that due to California's statute of limitations on assault and domestic violence, there is currently no legal action that can be taken. Earlier this year, on March 25, FBI and Homeland Security agents raided Combs's homes in LA and Miami as part of an \"ongoing investigation.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gasc\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Gasc\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l89520240522095852.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-25", "textStart": 1831, "textEnd": 1839}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Who are we going to call?\"\n\nMorales admitted she still feels \"scared\" to speak about her experience with Diddy and Ventura.\n\n\"We were always scared of Puff [Diddy],\" she said. \"He's a powerful person and we don't know what would happen to us if we spoke out.\"\n\nThe Independent has contacted Combs' representatives for comment.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Ventura in November alleging beatings and abuse was settled a day after it was filed, but Combs is currently facing a string of different civil lawsuits, which have accused him of sex trafficking, sexual abuse and rape.\n\nCombs has vehemently denied those allegations against him, while his lawyers have branded the lawsuits and their accusations as money grabs, \"baseless\" or \"sickening\". The musician has not been formally charged.\n\nIt comes after model Crystal McKinny filed a new lawsuit on Tuesday (21 May) claiming Combs sexually assaulted her at his recording studio in New York City in 2003.\n\nIn the new lawsuit - the sixth complaint of sexual assault filed against Combs in six months - McKinney said she was a successful 22-year-old model when she met Combs at a restaurant during Men's Fashion Week in Manhattan.\n\nCombs invited her to his recording studio later that night, according to the federal complaint filed in New York City.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that McKinney arrived to find Combs drinking and smoking marijuana with several other men. She smoked some marijuana, which she \"later came to understand\" was laced with a narcotic or intoxicating substance, the lawsuit says.\n\nShe alleges that Combs led her to the bathroom where she was forced to perform oral sex on him.\n\nThe claim was filed under a New York City law that allows accusers to file civil litigation during a limited window even if the alleged events happened long ago.\n\nRape Crisis offers support for those affected by rape and sexual abuse.

\"Diddy\" Combs has been accused of sexual assault in a new lawsuit filed on Tuesday by Crystal McKinney, a former model and winner of MTV's 1998 Model Mission competition show.\n\nAccording to the complaint, filed in New York, McKinney claims that she was \"drugged and sexually assaulted\" in 2003 by Combs following a Men's Fashion Week event in New York City.\n\nMcKinney, who was 22 years old at the time, first met Combs at a dinner, where he came on to her \"in a sexually suggestive manner\" and told her to call him later, the complaint alleges.\n\nMcKinney \"felt confused but hopeful that Combs would fulfil his promises to help her career,\" and Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, the complaint continues.\n\nAt the studio, Combs offered McKinney marijuana, which she claims was \"laced\" with \"a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nThe complaint alleges Combs saw McKinney was \"very intoxicated\" and demanded her to follow him as he \"physically led\" her to the bathroom.\n\nIn the bathroom, Combs \"began kissing her without her consent\" and later \"forced her to perform oral sex on him,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAfter the assault, McKinney claims she felt \"more and more woozy and then lost consciousness,\" later waking up in a taxicab heading back to the apartment belonging to the designer she was working with at the time.\n\n\"As her consciousness returned, Plaintiff realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\" the complaint reads.\n\nBad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing LLC, and Universal Music Group Inc., the entities of which were also named as defendants.\n\nMcKinney is suing the defendants for violation of the New York Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law.\n\nAccording to the New York City Council, the law gives \"survivors of gender-motivated acts of violence more time to pursue civil actions by extending the statute of limitations\" and also \"applies to such acts committed by parties who direct, enable, participate in, or conspire in a gender-motivated act of violence.\"\n\nMcKinney was crowned the winner of MTV's Model Mission in 1998 and was awarded a modelling contract with IMG.\n\nShe became a familiar face on various MTV shows and modelled in a fashion campaign for designer Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nAs a result of the incident, McKinney became \"severely depressed,\" and \"experienced alcohol and drug addiction\" as she tried to cope, the complaint claimed.\n\nTo this day, the complaint states, that McKinney still experiences mental health struggles stemming from the alleged assault and has since ceased pursuing a career in modeling.\n\nShe is seeking an unspecified amount in punitive and compensatory damages.", "source": {"uri":

The rapper has been sued for sexual harassment.\n\nAmerican rapper Sean Combs, also known as Diddy, who recently apologized after a video of him assaulting his ex-girlfriend surfaced, has been sued for allegedly drugging and harassing a model in 2003.\n\nModel Crystal McKinney, who was 22 years old at the time, claimed that Combs gave her alcohol, possibly laced with drugs, and then took her to the bathroom of his studio in New York where he sexually assaulted her. McKinney said that she woke up in a taxi after passing out and realized that she had been sexually assaulted. She stated that she met Combs at a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani and he invited her to his studio. She mentioned that they consumed alcohol and drugs there.\n\nAfter the incident, McKinney claimed that her modeling career ended and she fell into depression to the point of attempting suicide in 2004. The model filed a lawsuit against the rapper for the incident that occurred in 2003. This lawsuit is the latest in a series of accusations against Combs in recent months. Since November, six lawsuits have been filed against him, including one by his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, accusing him of rape and harassment.\n\nIn April, Combs' mansions in Florida and California were raided by a Department of Homeland Security team investigating human trafficking.

"Another sexual assault lawsuit has been filed against Sean 'Diddy' Combs, the latest in a string of allegations against the American rapper as he increasingly comes under scrutiny for his treatment of women.\n\nFormer model Crystal McKinney has alleged that Combs forced her to perform oral sex on him at a party in 2003.\n\nThe assault allegedly occurred after she was \"pressured to imbibe\" alcohol and marijuana, including a joint she believed to be laced with another narcotic, the lawsuit claims.\n\nCombs is the target of several civil lawsuits and his homes were raided this year by federal agents.\n\nCombs, who has denied previous accusations, has not responded to the latest allegation.\n\nLast week, he issued an apology after video surfaced of him physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura in 2016.\n\nThe footage, which was published by CNN, showed the rap mogul hitting, dragging, and kicking Ventura, who in a recent lawsuit alleged Combs subjected her to more than a decade of coercion by physical force and drugs, and a 2018 rape.\n\nVentura sued Combs in federal court last autumn in a lawsuit that was settled out of court but succeeded by a string of sexual assault claims against the hip-hop star.\n\nMcKinney's suit cited Ventura's case, plus four others against Combs in New York, saying she felt \"a moral obligation to speak up\" after seeing the other lawsuits.\n\n\"To this day, Plaintiff experiences bouts of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness and intimacy issues because of Combs's assault,\" the lawsuit

Following the federal raids on Combs' houses, Ray J told TMZ he thinks \"a lot of people are just trying to understand it,\" though he declined to comment when asked about Combs' infamous parties. Rapper Boosie Badazz, who clarified he was not defending Combs, questioned on Instagram Live why none of the celebrities that Combs had partied with were standing by him.\n\nNot everyone is silent about Combs, as some of his critics -- like 50 Cent -- have become more vocal amid his numerous lawsuits. 50 Cent, with whom Combs has had a highly publicized beef for decades, has consistently made posts on Instagram criticizing and trolling Combs since Ventura filed her lawsuit in November. 50 Cent has also said his production company, G-Unit Film & Television, is working on a documentary about the sexual assault allegations made against Combs, and all proceeds would be donated to sexual assault survivors. Aubrey O'Day, the Danity Kane singer once mentored by Combs and signed to his record label, Bad Boy Records, has also emerged as a vocal critic. She slammed Combs' apology video to Ventura after CNN published footage of him attacking Ventura in a hotel, stating: \"Diddy did not apologize to Cassie. He apologized to the world for seeing what he did.\" O'Day previously stated \"what you sow, you shall reap\" on her Instagram story after federal agents raided Combs' houses.\n\nCombs has been embroiled in legal troubles since Ventura filed a lawsuit against him in November, alleging he raped her and subjected her to physical abuse for years while the two were in a relationship -- Combs has denied the abuse allegations. The lawsuit was settled that month for an undisclosed sum. Last week, CNN published video that depicts Combs shoving Ventura to the ground, dragging her and kicking her, prompting a video apology from the rapper. The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office posted a statement to Instagram calling the video \"extremely disturbing\" but clarified it cannot charge Combs because the assault, which allegedly occurred in 2016, \"occurred beyond the timeline where a crime of assault can be prosecuted.\" Combs was sued several more times between November and February, including one lawsuit filed by the producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones, which alleged that he was sexually assaulted by associates of the rapper and that Combs possesses \"compromising footage of every person that has attended his freak off parties, and his house parties.\"\n\nHere Are The Major Allegations Against Sean 'Diddy' Combs -- As Rapper Apologizes For 'Disturbing' Video (Forbes)\n\n50 Cent Slams Sean 'Diddy' Combs Again -- 'We Can't Un See What We Saw' -- As Feud Continues (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosie_Badazz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boosie Badazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_J", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ray J"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_O'Day", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey O'Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Unit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G-Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danity_Kane", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danity Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/664ceb04445b7cade6c80cc7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2469,1388,x317,y109,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Moments later, Combs emerges from a room wearing only socks and a white towel wrapped around his waist. He chases the woman down, throws her to the ground, kicks her, punches her, drags her by her hoodie and hurls a vase at her.\n\nAll while deftly managing to keep his towel in place.\n\nRead more: Granderson: Cassie's lawsuit against Diddy keeps us talking about domestic violence\n\nThe victim is R&B singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura. In November, she filed a 35-page federal lawsuit against Combs and his label, Bad Boy Records, alleging that he had physically and sexually abused her for years and frequently forced her into encounters with male prostitutes that he watched and recorded.\n\nThe lawsuit, which left me feeling ill, lays out a disturbing narrative of extreme abuse, coerced drug use and sexual perversion over the course of the pair's 13-year relationship, which began in 2005. When they met, she was a 19-year-old aspiring singer, while he was a 37-year-old rap icon and record label executive. He held her future in his hands, and she describes being trapped in a classic cycle of abuse.\n\nFor more than a decade after he signed Ventura to his label, the suit alleges, Combs orchestrated most aspects of her life, regularly hiding her away in hotels -- she alleges one such three-week stay in Hawaii -- so the black eyes and split lips he inflicted would heal.\n\nRead more: Abcarian: 'Diaper Don'? Trump's supporters turn the tables on his puerile critics\n\nNaturally, Combs' attorney Ben Brafman feigned outrage at the idea that his client was an abuser:\n\n\"Mr. Combs vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations,\" he told the New York Times. \"For the past six months, Mr. Combs has been subjected to Ms. Ventura's persistent demand of $30 million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail.\"\n\nAu contraire, retorted Ventura's attorney Douglas Wigdor: \"Mr. Combs offered Ms. Ventura eight figures to silence her and prevent the filing of this lawsuit. She rejected his efforts.\"\n\nIt took tremendous courage for Ventura to file her lawsuit, which was made possible by New York's Adult Survivors' Act. The law gave victims a one-year window to file lawsuits for sexual misconduct alleged to have happened before 2019 for which the statute of limitations had expired. About 3,000 lawsuits were filed before the window closed in November, including, most famously, by E. Jean Carroll, who claimed that Donald Trump had raped her in a department store dressing room in 1996. A jury found Trump liable for defamation and sexual assault, which the presiding judge said was rape by another name.\n\nStrangely enough given Combs' professions of innocence and victimhood, Ventura's lawsuit was settled confidentially less than two days after it was filed. At the time, his lawyer emphasized that the settlement in no way implied that Combs was guilty.\n\nExcept, come on now. The explosive video perfectly matches many of the allegations made in Ventura's lawsuit; she doesn't appear to have been making it up.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that people in Combs' orbit -- his attorney, the president of his record label -- pressured her to return to him when she tried to escape. \"Each time Ms. Ventura tried to run away,\" the lawsuit alleges, \"Mr. Combs and his powerful network would force her back to him.\"\n\nOn Sunday, all too predictably, a teary Combs posted a video on Instagram.\n\n\"I was f -- ed up,\" he says. \"I hit rock bottom. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nMe, me, me, me. Not a word about the hell he put Ventura through nor even a mention of her name. And anyway, when, exactly, did he hit rock bottom and have his epiphany?\n\nAfter all, Ventura alleges that in September 2018, more than two years after the hotel hallway incident, he raped her at her home after they met for dinner in Malibu to discuss the end of their relationship.\n\nWithin months of Ventura's lawsuit, four other lawsuits were filed accusing him of sexual assault and other offenses, including one by a woman who was in college when she alleges that Combs drugged and assaulted her, and another by a woman who was a high school junior when she alleges she was sex trafficked and gang raped by Combs and the longtime president of his record label.\n\nIt's unfortunate that Combs cannot be prosecuted for what he did to Ventura in that hallway. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office said it is powerless to act because the statute of limitations has expired.\n\nBut Combs' troubles may be just beginning. In March, his homes in Miami and Los Angeles were raided by agents of the Department of Homeland Security, who seized computers, hard drives and guns, according to news reports, which said the raids were part of a sexual assault and sex trafficking investigation of Combs, a father of seven. He has not been charged with a crime.\n\nSomeone leaked photos of the aftermath of the Holmby Hills raid to TMZ. The rooms looked as if a tornado had swept through -- papers, clothing, children's shoes and stuffed animals strewn all over. News video showed two of Combs' adult children in handcuffs outside.\n\nIt was sad, yes, but an apt visual metaphor for the mess Combs has made.\n\n@robinkabcarian", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Male prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paraphilia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhythm and blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Wigdor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Wigdor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Brafman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Brafman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

Combs has not been charged or accused by federal prosecutors of a crime, and the purpose of the search remains unclear.\n\nCombs, 54, has denied all of the allegations against him, with his attorneys characterizing some of the lawsuits and their accusations to Forbes as money grabs, \"baseless\" or \"sickening.\" Combs has not been criminally charged.\n\nAn upcoming docuseries. Producer Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson said Tuesday that Netflix had won a \"bidding war\" for a docuseries about the string of recent abuse, rape and sex trafficking allegations against Combs. Jackson confirmed in a tweet Tuesday that the streamer bought the G-Unit Film & Television series about Combs he first started teasing in December, adding that, \"if more victims keep coming out, I'm gonna need more episodes.\" Proceeds from the film go to victims of sexual assault, Jackson said in November.\n\nOn Sunday, Combs posted to Instagram to apologize for his \"disgusting\" behavior in the surveillance video that showed him grabbing, dragging and kicking Cassie in 2016. The video seemed to back up much of the claims Ventura made in her November lawsuit, which an attorney for Combs called \"offensive and outrageous\" at the time. Los Angeles District Attorney's Office called the video \"extremely disturbing\" and \"difficult to watch\" but said no charges would be filed because the apparent assault took place beyond the statue of limitation in California. In his apology video, Combs said the events occurred in \"one of the darkest times\" of his life and said he was \"truly sorry\" for his behavior. Meredith Firetog, one of Ventura's lawyers, later slammed the apology as disingenuous in a statement and said it was \"more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\" In Ventura's November lawsuit, she accused Combs of paying the hotel in which the surveillance video was captured $50,000 for the footage.\n\nCombs' former personal chef, Cindy Rueda, accused Combs in a since-settled 2017 sexual harassment lawsuit of having her prepare and serve food to the rapper and his guests while they were engaged in sexual activity or right after they had done so.\n\nThe allegations contained in lawsuits against Combs date as far back as the 1990s, when he founded his own record label, Bad Boy Records, which Rolling Stone has called \"one of the most influential hip-hop labels of all time.\" The label has signed major artists like The Notorious B.I.G., Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Cassie, and has put out several of Combs' own albums, including \"Press Play\" and \"Last Train To Paris.\" Combs sold a 50% stake in Bad Boy to Warner Music Group in a reported $30 million deal in 2005. Combs has built a fortune through Bad Boy Records, several liquor brands, a fashion label and other ventures. He sold his share in the DeLe\u00f3n tequila brand for $200 million earlier this year. He was ranked No. 14 on Forbes' list of the highest-paid entertainers in 2022, making an estimated $90 million that year. One of the rapper's raided homes is located in Holmby Hills, an affluent neighborhood where Combs purchased a home for $40 million ten years ago.\n\nFeds Search Sean 'Diddy' Combs' L.A.

Upon arrival, the group began drinking Hennessy and passing around joints, which she claims in documents were laced with narcotics.\n\nShe claims he told her to follow him to the bathroom where he forced her head down to his crotch and demanded she \"suck it.\"\n\nShe is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nMcKinney is the latest to accuse Combs of assault.\n\nThe disgraced music mogul is also facing a $30 million federal lawsuit from music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones who claims Diddy repeatedly sexually assaulted him while they worked together on his latest album from September 2022 to November 2023.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Jones named 50 Cent's ex Daphne Joy and City Girls rapper Yung Miami as Combs' alleged sex workers.\n\nThe \"Many Men\" hitmaker responded to Jones' claims on Instagram, calling out Joy and Combs.\n\n\"I didn't know you was a sex worker, you little sex worker. LOL,\" he wrote alongside two photos of himself smoking a cigar in the rain. \"Yo this s-t is a movie.\"\n\nThe Onlyfans model hit back at her ex, accusing him of rape and physical abuse, which he denies.\n\nOn Sunday, Diddy shared a public apology after 2016 surveillance footage surfaced showing the rapper brutally beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that. I was f -- ked up.

I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" the music mogul said in a video statement posted Sunday to Instagram and Facebook.\n\nThe security video appears to show Combs, wearing only a white towel, punching and kicking Cassie, an R&B singer who was his protege and longtime girlfriend at the time. The footage also shows Combs shoving and dragging Cassie, and throwing a vase in her direction.\n\nAdams, who was seen smiling and clapping alongside Combs at the key ceremony in Times Square on Sept. 15, wants to stress there has to be a process for making a decision on the key, since revocation would be precedent-setting.\n\nA city hall spokesperson confirms the Adams administration is \"not aware of a time ever where a key has been revoked but the team is looking at what is possible now.\"\n\n\"There's a process. There's a panel, they're going to look over it, they're going to make a recommendation to me and we're going to take the next steps,\" Adams said Tuesday at his weekly media availability. \"My heart goes out to the young lady who was assaulted. All of us are disgusted at the video of seeing something of that magnitude. But we want to take the process. We've never removed the key from anyone before. We want to make sure we do it right because now we're going to set precedence and we want to make sure we're going to do it right. And I was very clear, we're going to see what the next steps are and we're not going to get ahead of ourselves.\"\n\nThe mayor did not give a timeline for making a decision.\n\nCassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, sued Combs in November over what she said was years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. The suit was settled the next day, but spurred intense scrutiny of Combs, with several more lawsuits filed in the following months, along with a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led authorities to raid Combs' mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nHe had denied the allegations in the lawsuits, but neither he nor his representatives had responded to the newly emerged video until Sunday.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Diddy says on the video. He adds, \"I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nCombs is looking somber and wearing a T-shirt in the selfie-style apology video, and appears to be on a patio. It is the hip-hop mogul's most direct response and first apology after six months of allegations that have threatened his reputation and career.\n\nMeredith Firetog, who represents Ventura and other women who have sued Combs, said the apology was \"more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\n\n\"When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday,\" the lawyer said in a statement. \"That he was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\"\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Ventura has done.\n\nIn December, after Ventura and at least three other women had filed lawsuits against him, Combs posted a statement on Instagram broadly denying the truth of all of them.\n\n\"Let me absolutely clear. I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" that post said.\n\nThe security camera video, dated March 5, 2016, closely resembles the description of an incident at an InterContinental Hotel in the Century City area of Los Angeles described in Ventura' lawsuit.\n\nThe suit alleges that Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the security video immediately after the incident. Neither he or his representatives have addressed that specific allegation. CNN did not say how it obtained the footage.\n\nThe suit said Ventura had been trying to get away from a sleeping Combs, who had already punched her in the face before the video began.\n\nCombs is not in danger of being criminally prosecuted for the beating. The statutes of limitations for the assault and battery charges he would be likely to face expired years ago.\n\nThe same is true of many of the allegations in the lawsuits, but the federal investigators following Combs are likely looking for potential crimes they can bring under the law.\n\nVentura signed to Diddy's label in 2005. The two had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship for more than a decade starting in 2007.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Times Square"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhythm and blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century City"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/05/GettyImages-1682848964.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-15", "textStart": 1000, "textEnd": 1008}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-03-05", "textStart": 4152, "textEnd": 4165}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

His new one should be 'woman beater.' | Opinion", "body": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has apologized after video emerged appearing to show him assaulting then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016.\n\nHip-hop mogul Sean Combs goes by several different names. \"Puff Daddy;\" \"P. Diddy;\" \"Diddy;\" and \"Puffy.\" Now you can add \"woman beater\" to the list.\n\nA video obtained and broadcast by CNN on Friday shows the rap icon kicking and dragging his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles.\n\nThe surveillance footage, dated March 5, 2016, shows multiple camera angles capturing the incident. Notably, the video lacks audio, forcing us to rely solely on the visual evidence of Comb's actions.\n\nVentura exits a hotel room and walks toward the elevators. Combs, who only has a towel around his waist, gives chase. He grabs Ventura by the back of her neck and slings her to the ground. Still holding his towel with one hand, he then kicks Ventura twice while she's on the ground. He then picks up her bag and purse and attempts to drag her back to his hotel room by the neck of her sweatshirt. Combs walks back toward his room as Ventura is seen picking up a hotel phone.\n\nSlapping for 'sport' is absurd. Power Slap founder Dana White profits from pain.\n\nAccording to CNN, in her lawsuit, Ventura claims before Combs attacked her in the hallway, he got intoxicated and punched her in the face, giving her a black eye. When she attempted to leave the hotel room, he snapped.\n\nWhy did it take a video for us to believe the victim?\n\nThe video is certainly disturbing, but what is even more alarming is the fact that it took a video for people to believe that Ventura was finally being abused. When individuals in abusive relationships dare to speak out, it is crucial that we believe and support them and not wait.\n\nSince the video's release, Combs issued an apology, calling his behavior on that video \"Inexcusable.\"\n\n\"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" Combs added. \"I went, and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nCombs' apology fits the script of most abusers. \"I feel horrible. I'm seeking counseling.\" Insert any number of platitudes here.\n\nRemember, Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in November, alleging that she was raped and subjected to years of repeated physical and other abuses by Combs.\n\nAt the time, Combs's attorney called Ventura's allegations outrageous, and he accused her of threats to write a damaging book about Combs if she wasn't given $30 million. However, Combs settled the suit faster than Biggie Smalls could crush 14 rap bars.\n\n\"We have decided to resolve this matter amicably. I wish Cassie and her family all the best. Love,\" Combs said in a statement.\n\nRich and powerful people like Combs can hide abuse\n\nNatalie Hayden, co-host of ExPosed The Podcast, part of a Milwaukee non-profit that focuses on supporting survivors of domestic abuse, found the video troubling for several reasons. She was concerned that many people did not believe Ventura's claims until the video was released. She also knows that someone as rich and powerful as Combs can do things to hide abuse.\n\nHayden said it takes a lot of courage for a victim of abuse to come forward, and when they do, we should believe them.\n\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the most dangerous time for a woman suffering from domestic abuse is when she decides to leave. On average, in the U.S., nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner. This equates to more than 10 million women and men a year.\n\nCombs has power and success and a net worth of $800 million. Some may have believed that this would make it impossible for him to be abusive, but Hayden said that there is no one-size-fits-all for an abuser or a person being abused. ExPosed The Podcast uses its platform to have difficult conversations:\n\nThe key is not to let the abuse fester and make you feel like you have no way out. The moment you give up is when the abuser wins, Hayden said.\n\nCombs has ben roundly condemned on social media\n\nSince the video came out last Friday, many celebrities have condemned Combs. Here's what a few had to say on social media:\n\nCombs' legal issues are far from over. The release of the video comes on the heels of other allegations in civil lawsuits of the mogul being involved in sex trafficking and sexual abuse. In March, Homeland Security agents searched his Los Angeles and Miami homes. He was not arrested or charged with a crime, and his lawyer maintains his client's innocence.\n\nDon't think fascism could happen here? You haven't tracked the school book bans.\n\nCombs will endure public shame and lose out on some endorsement opportunities, but the scars he left on Ventura won't fade as quickly as a 24-hour news cycle.\n\nI hope Combs is committed to being a better man, as he said in his apology video, but I doubt it. Combs is a liar, and he would still be lying to his fans and anyone who would listen if that video had not been released.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal

His new one should be 'woman beater.' | Opinion", "body": "Sean Combs' apology fits the script of most abusers. \"I feel horrible...I'm seeking counseling...\"\n\nHip-hop mogul Sean Combs goes by several different names. \"Puff Daddy;\" \"P. Diddy;\" \"Diddy;\" and \"Puffy.\" Now you can add \"woman beater\" to the list.\n\nA video obtained and broadcast by CNN on Friday shows the rap icon kicking and dragging his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles.\n\nThe surveillance footage, dated March 5, 2016, shows multiple camera angles capturing the incident. Notably, the video lacks audio, forcing us to rely solely on the visual evidence of Comb's actions.\n\nVentura exits a hotel room and walks toward the elevators. Combs, who only has a towel around his waist, gives chase. He grabs Ventura by the back of her neck and slings her to the ground. Still holding his towel with one hand, he then kicks Ventura twice while she's on the ground. He then picks up her bag and purse and attempts to drag her back to his hotel room by the neck of her sweatshirt. Combs walks back toward his room as Ventura is seen picking up a hotel phone.\n\nSlapping for 'sport' is absurd.Power Slap founder Dana White profits from pain.\n\nAccording to CNN, in her lawsuit, Ventura claims before Combs attacked her in the hallway, he got intoxicated and punched her in the face, giving her a black eye. When she attempted to leave the hotel room, he snapped.\n\nWhy did it take a video for us to believe the victim?\n\nThe video is certainly disturbing, but what is even more alarming is the fact that it took a video for people to believe that Ventura was finally being abused. When individuals in abusive relationships dare to speak out, it is crucial that we believe and support them and not wait.\n\nSince the video's release, Combs issued an apology, calling his behavior on that video \"Inexcusable.\"\n\n\"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" Combs added. \"I went, and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nCombs' apology fits the script of most abusers. \"I feel horrible. I'm seeking counseling.\" Insert any number of platitudes here.\n\nRemember, Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in November, alleging that she was raped and subjected to years of repeated physical and other abuses by Combs.\n\nAt the time, Combs's attorney called Ventura's allegations outrageous, and he accused her of threats to write a damaging book about Combs if she wasn't given $30 million. However, Combs settled the suit faster than Biggie Smalls could crush 14 rap bars.\n\n\"We have decided to resolve this matter amicably. I wish Cassie and her family all the best. Love,\" Combs said in a statement.\n\nRich and powerful people like Combs can hide abuse\n\nNatalie Hayden, co-host of ExPosed The Podcast, part of a Milwaukee non-profit that focuses on supporting survivors of domestic abuse, found the video troubling for several reasons. She was concerned that many people did not believe Ventura's claims until the video was released. She also knows that someone as rich and powerful as Combs can do things to hide abuse.\n\nHayden said it takes a lot of courage for a victim of abuse to come forward, and when they do, we should believe them.\n\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the most dangerous time for a woman suffering from domestic abuse is when she decides to leave. On average, in the U.S., nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner. This equates to more than 10 million women and men a year.\n\nCombs has power and success and a net worth of $800 million. Some may have believed that this would make it impossible for him to be abusive, but Hayden said that there is no one-size-fits-all for an abuser or a person being abused. ExPosed The Podcast uses its platform to have difficult conversations:\n\nThe key is not to let the abuse fester and make you feel like you have no way out. The moment you give up is when the abuser wins, Hayden said.\n\nCombs has ben roundly condemned on social media\n\nSince the video came out last Friday, many celebrities have condemned Combs. Here's what a few had to say on social media:\n\nCombs' legal issues are far from over. The release of the video comes on the heels of other allegations in civil lawsuits of the mogul being involved in sex trafficking and sexual abuse. In March, Homeland Security agents searched his Los Angeles and Miami homes. He was not arrested or charged with a crime, and his lawyer maintains his client's innocence.\n\nDon't think fascism could happen here?You haven't tracked the school book bans.\n\nCombs will endure public shame and lose out on some endorsement opportunities, but the scars he left on Ventura won't fade as quickly as a 24-hour news cycle.\n\nI hope Combs is committed to being a better man, as he said in his apology video, but I doubt it. Combs is a liar, and he would still be lying to his fans and anyone who would listen if that video had not been released.", "source": {"uri": "wausaudailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Amid the chatter surrounding those images, another accuser has filed a lawsuit alleging that Diddy sexually assaulted her in 2003.\n\nAs reported by CNN, Crystal McKinney, a winner of MTV's Model Mission series, was 22 at the time she met Diddy during a Men's Fashion Week dinner in 2003. McKinney wrote in her complaint that Combs invited her to his nearby recording studio where she claims he allegedly drugged her with marijuana laced with a stronger narcotic.\n\nThe details of McKinney's accounts of the events might be disturbing to some so we urge caution from this point forward. McKinney added that she was already under the influence of alcohol when she was handed the marijuana joint and says she was then led to a bathroom by Combs and forced to perform oral sex on him.\n\nMcKinney says she lost consciousness while at the studio and woke up in a cab heading to the home of a designer she was working with at the time and realized that she was sexually assaulted.\n\nBad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing LLC, and Universal Music Group Inc. are all named as defendants in McKinney's lawsuit and according to CNN, none of them made any public inference to the filing. The lawsuit was filed over violations noted in the New York Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law. It is the sixth such lawsuit, all of which make mention of sexual assault\n\nPhoto: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis / Getty\n\nRELATED TAGS\n\nCrime and Justice Crime and Punishment Diddy lawsuit sexual assault", "source": {"uri": "hiphopwired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Latest Hip-Hop News, Music and Media | Hip-Hop Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_strong@hiphopwired.com", "name": "Lance Strong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_(cannabis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint (cannabis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_John", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean John"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/05/1716397819912.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Not only is she suing the rapper, but his record label, Bad Boy Entertainment, his label's distributor, Universal Music Group, and his fashion brand, Sean John Clothing.\n\nThe court documents state that a then 22-year-old McKinney, a rising fashion model at the time, was introduced to the rapper by an unnamed fashion designer, who allegedly dressed and styled her \"to ensure Combs found her attractive\" before they met at the restaurant known as Cipriani Downtown.\n\nCombs then allegedly promised to help the model \"make it big one day\" during dinner, before proceeding to make \"flirtatious\" remarks to her and inviting her back to his studio later that night to \"get to know her better.\"\n\nThe filing then states that Combs and an associate pressured McKinney to smoke and drink until she felt like she was \"floating\", even though she insisted she'd had enough. The document then describes how the model was sexually assaulted, and that she lost consciousness shortly after, waking up \"in shock\" in a taxi back to the designer's apartment.\n\nCrystal claimed in the suit that she was subsequently \"blackballed\" in the modeling industry after the incident, and she is seeking compensatory and punitive damages in the case, as well as coverage of her attorney's fees and costs. She also demanded a trial by jury.\n\nThe model is filing her lawsuit under the NYC Gender Motivated Violence Act, allowing victims of violence committed on the basis of gender in the city to sue their abusers, regardless of when the abuse took place, before the act's expiration in 2025.\n\nShe is now one of six accusers who have filed claims of sexual assault against the rapper, all of which he has denied.\n\nThis latest case comes hot on the heels of the release of a video showing Combs attacking ex-partner Cassie Ventura in a hotel in 2016.\n\nCassie first filed a 35-page federal complaint accusing the rapper of sexual assault, battery, and sex trafficking and of requiring her to engage in forced sexual acts on November 2023. The suit was settled the day after it was filed.\n\nShe has not commented on the clip, although her husband Alex Fine shared a message on Instagram directed at \"abusers\".\n\nCombs shared a video on Instagram referring to the 2016 video as a \"rock bottom\" moment, calling his actions \"inexcusable\" and apologizing.\n\nThe rapper faces lawsuits from Joi Dickerson-Neal, Liza Gardner, former producer Rodney Jones, and Jane Doe - the latter two accused him of sex trafficking.

(Amazed face emoji.)\n\n\"I don't want no parts of that.\"\n\nThe rapper also taunted Combs over the fact fitness brand Peloton announced this week they were taking his songs off their exercise lessons in the wake of the release of footage on 19 May that showed him assaulting his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, 37, at the InterContinental Hotel, LA, in 2016.\n\nReferring to Peloton users' entry passes to its exercise sessions lessons, 50 said on X: \"Damn so now they want the key back they took the music off Peloton to make sure no fat girls like him, this is diabolical.

She was 22 years old at the time. McKinney reportedly claims in the lawsuit that Diddy offered her marijuana at his recording studio, which she alleges was \"laced\" with \"a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\"\n\nShe alleges that Diddy could see she was \"very intoxicated\" and \"physically led\" her to a bathroom, where he \"began kissing her without her consent,\" the lawsuit reads according to CNN. McKinney alleges Diddy then \"forced her to perform oral sex on him,\" the outlet reported.\n\nMcKinney alleges in the lawsuit that the incident unfolded after she met Combs at a dinner and he came on to her \"in a sexually suggestive manner,\" according to CNN. She reportedly claims that she \"felt confused but hopeful that Combs would fulfill his promises to help her career,\" and he went on to invite her to the studio that evening, where the alleged sexual assault took place.\n\nThe court documents allege that McKinney felt \"more and more woozy and then lost consciousness,\" the outlet reported. She reportedly claims she woke up in a taxi cab that was taking her to the residence where the designer she was then working with lived.\n\n\"As her consciousness returned, Plaintiff realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs,\" the complaint alleges, according to CNN.\n\nRepresentatives for Bad Boy Records, Sean John Clothing LLC and Universal Music Group Inc. were declared defendants in McKinney's lawsuit alongside Diddy, CNN reported.\n\nMcKinney is suing the defendants under the New York Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law, according to the outlet. The law allows \"survivors of gender-motivated acts of violence more time to pursue civil actions by extending the statute of limitations,\" according to the New York City Council's website.\n\nMcKinney's court filing claims the former model became \"severely depressed\" after the alleged sexual assault, and \"experienced alcohol and drug addiction\" as she attempted to address the aftermath, CNN reported. She reportedly still experiences mental health struggles and has ceased her career in modeling. She is seeking punitive damages and compensation in the lawsuit, the outlet reported.\n\nThis lawsuit comes on the heels of the release of surveillance video from a hotel dating back to 2016, which appears to show Diddy abusing his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. Combs apologized in a video posted to social media, Sunday.

"title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs accused of sexually assaulting model in new lawsuit", "body": "Another sexual assault lawsuit has been filed against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the latest in a string of allegations against the American rapper as he increasingly comes under scrutiny for his treatment of women.\n\nFormer model Crystal McKinney said Tuesday that Combs had forced her to perform oral sex on him at a party in 2003.\n\nThe assault occurred after she was \"pressured to imbibe\" alcohol and marijuana, including a joint she believed to be laced with another narcotic, the lawsuit said.\n\nCombs is the target of several civil lawsuits that characterize him as a violent sexual predator who used alcohol and drugs to subdue his victims, and his homes were raided this year by federal agents.\n\nCombs, who has denied previous accusations, has not responded to the latest allegation.\n\nHowever, last week, he issued an apology after video surfaced of him physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura in 2016.\n\nMore from this section Freeport police appoint first Black assistant chief in department history Tyson Fury branded 'deluded' and 'so dumb' by boxing

recent lawsuit said Combs subjected her to more than a decade of coercion by physical force and drugs, plus a 2018 rape.\n\nVentura sued Combs in federal court last fall in a bombshell suit that was settled out of court but succeeded by a string of similarly lurid sexual assault claims against the hip-hop star.\n\nMcKinney's suit cited Ventura's case, plus four others against Combs in New York, saying she felt \"a moral obligation to speak up\" after seeing the other lawsuits.\n\n\"To this day, Plaintiff experiences bouts of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness and intimacy issues because of Combs's assault,\" the lawsuit says, while also accusing the rapper of using his influence to stifle her career.\n\nbur-nro/sms", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

The model was working in Miami at the time, she says", "body": "Former model Crystal McKinney filed her federal complaint in NYC on Tuesday, alleging the rapper drugged her and forced her to perform oral sex while at his Midtown Manhattan studio in 2003.\n\nMcKinney, who is originally from Georgia, won MTV's inaugural Model Mission beauty pageant at the age of 17, and was awarded a contract with the IMG agency.\n\nWhile doing gigs in Miami, the then 22 year old was invited by an unnamed designer to Men's Fashion Week in NYC, the filing, viewed by the Miami Herald, says. She was told she would be introduced to Combs at an event at Cipriani Downtown. She found herself seated across from the music mogul, who began \"coming on\" to her.\n\nThe Bad Boy Records founder told her he had \"power in the industry\" and was going to help her advance, while leaning across the table and telling her she was \"beautiful,\" the woman alleges.\n\nMcKinney then claims Diddy ended up inviting her to his nearby recording studio for a small gathering. The guests began passing around \"a bottle of Hennessy and joints,\" says the court document.\n\nMcKinney claims that Combs told her,\"You've never had weed like this before.\"\n\nShe alleges that the joint was \"laced\" with a narcotic or other \"intoxicating substance\" because it made her feel as if she were \"floating.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Diddy's son just released a diss track about the raids\n\nThe onetime beauty queen says Combs eventually led her to the bathroom, and \"began kissing her without her consent.\" He then \"shoved her head down to his crotch\" and ordered her to perform oral sex, the suit claims, and she complied.\n\nMcKinney claims that she eventually passed out and woke up in a taxi.\n\nDue to the \"traumatic event,\" the woman preserved the \"unwashed\" outfit she was wearing that night, \"a black leather coat with a fur hood, translucent chiffon beige V-cut shirt and jewel encrusted jeans.\"\n\nAfter the alleged assault, the plaintiff's work opportunities quickly began to dwindle, says the complaint, and she believed she'd been \"blackballed\" by Combs.\n\nIn 2004, McKinney attempted suicide and was hospitalized due to the alleged abuse that \"altered the trajectory of plaintiff's career,\" says the legal document.\n\nREAD MORE: See what Diddy's Miami Beach mansion looked like after raid\n\nThe new suit comes just days after CNN released shocking surveillance video from 2016 that shows Combs beating up ex Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway.\n\nOn Sunday, the embattled singer apologized in an Instagram video, saying he was \"disgusted\" by his actions and \"truly sorry\" without mentioning Ventura, who settled with him for an undisclosed amount last November.\n\nSeveral more suits followed, including a bombshell filing in February by producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones, accusing Combs of abuse, as well as sex and drug trafficking.\n\nJones' $30 million suit spurred a federal investigation and raids on two of Combs' homes, including one on Star Island in Miami Beach.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeleine_marr@miamiherald.com",

(Amazed face emoji.)\n\n\"I don't want no parts of that.\"\n\nThe rapper also taunted Combs over the fact fitness brand Peloton announced this week they were taking his songs off their exercise lessons in the wake of the release of footage on 19 May that showed him assaulting his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, 37, at the InterContinental Hotel, LA, in 2016.\n\nReferring to Peloton users' entry passes to its exercise sessions lessons, 50 said on X: \"Damn so now they want the key back they took the music off Peloton to make sure no fat girls like him, this is diabolical. LOL.\"\n\nThe latest woman to take a case against Combs is former model Crystal McKinney.\n\nShe accused him in a filing that emerged on Tuesday of forcing her to perform a sex act after promising her a career boost.\n\nCrystal says she met Combs when she was aged 22 at a 2003 Men's Fashion Week event in New York City, where he invited her back to his music studio.\n\nCrystal said she smoked a joint with Combs and his entourage she fears was laced with another drug, before he allegedly forced her into a sex act in the bathroom.\n\nShe added in her lawsuit she later lost consciousness and woke up in a taxi, where she realised she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nCrystal added she was then blacklisted from the modelling industry and blamed herself for \"sabotaging her own career\",\n\nShe is seeking undisclosed damages from the rapper and attempted suicide in 2004 and was hospitalised, according to her filing.\n\nCombs, who has changed his name to Sean Love Combs, said in an apology video on Instagram about his attack on Cassie: \"I was f****** up. I mean I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behaviour on that video is inexcusable.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted.

She claims she obliged under the reassurance they wouldn't be alone in the studio. But when she got to the studio, McKinney claims \"she found Combs and several other men seated together.\" She claims they were passing around \"a bottle of Hennessy and joints.\"\n\nMcKinney alleges she took a hit, which she said \"felt very powerful.\" The model claims in her lawsuit that she \"later came to understand that Combs had laced the joint with a narcotic or other intoxicating substance.\" She also claims Diddy \"pressured her to imbibe more alcohol and marijuana by telling her that she was acting too uptight.\"\n\nMcKinney stated in court documents that she \"felt as if she was floating,\" and that after seeing that she was very intoxicated, \"[Diddy] demanded [she] follow him.\" She claims Diddy physically led her to the bathroom where he \"forced himself [on her] and began kissing her without her consent.\"\n\nShe claims Diddy then \"shoved her head down to his crotch before commanding her to 'suck it.'\" She alleges she refused but Diddy \"pushed her head down onto his phallus and forced her to perform oral sex on him.\"\n\nMcKinney claims Diddy ultimately led her back to the studio and \"felt more and more woozy\" before losing consciousness. She claims she \"awakened in shock to find herself in a taxicab heading back to the designer's apartment.\" She also claims that \"as her consciousness returned, [she] realized that she had been sexually assaulted by Combs.\"\n\nFollowing the alleged assault, McKinney claims Diddy had her \"blackballed\" in the industry and \"utilized his significant influence to impede [her] career growth.\"\n\nThen, sometime in 2004, McKinney claims she attempted suicide and was hospitalized. And in the ensuing years, McKinney claims she experienced alcohol and drug addiction \"as she attempted to cope with the emotional trauma of being assaulted.\"\n\nMcKinney -- who claims the clothing she wore on the night of the alleged assault remains unwashed and wrapped in plastic -- stated her marriage (from 2006 to 2010) \"fell apart as she had a mental breakdown precipitated by memories of the assault.\"\n\nMcKinney, who lives in Georgia, is suing Diddy for sexual assault under the New York City Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act.\n\nThis is now the sixth sexual assault lawsuit Diddy is facing. It was R&B singer Cassie Ventura's lawsuit in November that set Diddy's legal troubles in motion. Months after that initial lawsuit -- which the parties \"amicably\" settled less than 24 hours later -- security footage surfaced last week -- published by CNN -- showing Diddy physically assaulting Cassie in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. The video, complete with multiple camera angles, was dated March 5, 2006.\n\nDiddy has since broken his silence in wake of the video and said he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions in the video.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person",

I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u00b4m disgusted now,' the music mogul said in a video statement posted Sunday to Instagram and Facebook.\n\nDiddy was pictured in Miami Beach, Florida Sunday after releasing the apology clip.\n\nThe security video aired Friday shows Combs, wearing only a white towel, punching and kicking Cassie, an R&B singer who was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and longtime girlfriend at the time. The footage also shows Combs shoving and dragging Cassie, and throwing a vase in her direction.\n\nCassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, sued Combs in November over what she said was years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. The suit was settled the next day, but spurred intense scrutiny of Combs, with several more lawsuits filed in the following months, along with a federal criminal sex-trafficking investigation that led authorities to raid Combs\u00b4 mansions in Los Angeles and Miami.\n\nHe had denied the allegations in the lawsuits, but neither he nor his representatives had responded to the newly emerged video until Sunday.\n\n'It\u00b4s so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,' Diddy says on the video. 'I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab.'\n\nHe added, 'I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I\u00b4m so sorry. But I\u00b4m committed to be a better man each and every day. I\u00b4m not asking for forgiveness. I\u00b4m truly sorry.'\n\nCombs is looking somber and wearing a T-shirt in the selfie-style apology video, and appears to be on a patio. It is the hip-hop mogul's most direct response and first apology after six months of allegations that have threatened his reputation and career.\n\nDiddy on Sunday admitted that he beat his ex-girlfriend Cassie in a hotel hallway in 2016 after CNN released video of the attack, saying in a video apology he was 'truly sorry' and his actions were 'inexcusable'\n\nDiddy said of his conduct depicted in the clip: 'I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u00b4m disgusted now'\n\nMeredith Firetog, who represents Ventura and other women who have sued Combs, said the apology was 'more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\n\n'When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday,' the lawyer said in a statement. 'That he was only compelled to 'apologize\u00b4 once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.'\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Ventura has done.\n\nIn December, after Ventura and at least three other women had filed lawsuits against him, Combs posted a statement on Instagram broadly denying the truth of all of them.\n\n'Let me absolutely clear. I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,' that post said.\n\nThe security camera video, dated March 5, 2016, closely resembles the description of an incident at an InterContinental Hotel in the Century City area of Los Angeles described in Ventura' lawsuit.\n\nThe suit alleges that Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the security video immediately after the incident. Neither he or his representatives have addressed that specific allegation. CNN did not say how it obtained the footage.\n\nThe suit said Ventura had been trying to get away from a sleeping Combs, who had already punched her in the face before the video began.\n\nThe footage also shows Combs shoving and dragging Cassie, and throwing a vase in her direction\n\nCombs is not in danger of being criminally prosecuted for the beating. The statutes of limitations for the assault and battery charges he would be likely to face expired years ago.\n\nThe same is true of many of the allegations in the lawsuits, but the federal investigators following Combs are likely looking for potential crimes they can bring under the law.\n\nVentura signed to Diddy's label in 2005. The two had an on-again-off-again romantic relationship for more than a decade starting in 2007.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors":

allegations against the American rapper as he increasingly comes under scrutiny for his treatment of women.\n\nFormer model Crystal McKinney said Tuesday that Combs had forced her to perform oral sex on him at a party in 2003.\n\nThe assault occurred after she was \"pressured to imbibe\" alcohol and marijuana, including a joint she believed to be laced with another narcotic, the lawsuit said.\n\nCombs is the target of several civil lawsuits that characterize him as a violent sexual predator who used alcohol and drugs to subdue his victims, and his homes were raided this year by federal agents.\n\nCombs, who has denied previous accusations, has not responded to the latest allegation.\n\nHowever, last week, he issued an apology after video surfaced of him physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Casandra Ventura in 2016.\n\nThe footage, which was published by CNN, shows the rap mogul hitting, dragging and kicking Ventura, who in a recent lawsuit said Combs subjected her to more than a decade of coercion by physical force and drugs, plus a 2018 rape.\n\nVentura sued Combs in federal court last fall in a bombshell suit that was settled out of court but succeeded by a string of similarly lurid sexual assault claims against the hip-hop star.\n\nMcKinney's suit cited Ventura's case, plus four others against Combs in New York, saying she felt \"a moral obligation to speak up\" after seeing the other lawsuits.\n\n\"To this day, Plaintiff experiences bouts of depression, anxiety, body image issues, feelings of worthlessness and intimacy issues because of Combs's

He can manipulate anything, anyone,\" said Roger Bonds, Combs' former head of security. \"Money and power is all he's all about.\"\n\nBonds, who served on Combs' security staff for nearly a decade, from 2003 to 2012, said in a recent interview with Piers Morgan that Combs' ex-girlfriend Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura was one of the people manipulated by the Bad Boy Records co-founder. He also claimed on Monday that Ventura -- who sued the rapper in November, alleging assault -- wasn't the only woman who allegedly suffered physical violence from Combs.\n\nLate model and actor Kim Porter was also subjected to the hip-hop star's violent attacks, Bonds alleged. The ex-bodyguard said he witnessed Combs \"smack\" and \"grab\" Porter. Combs and Porter were romantically linked from 1994 to 2007 and share three children. Their son Christian \"King\" Combs was sued for alleged sexual assault in April. Porter died in 2018 of lobar pneumonia. She was 47.\n\nA representative for Combs did not immediately respond Tuesday to The Times' request for comment.\n\nBonds told Morgan he saw Combs get violent with women \"around four or five times\" during his tenure and added, \"I've seen him get physical ... grab 'em up.\"\n\nCombs, who is facing several sexual assault lawsuits and a federal probe, became the center of renewed controversy last week when CNN published hotel security footage showing the 2016 assault alleged by Ventura. During the incident, which the singer detailed in her since-settled lawsuit, Combs can be seen chasing, grabbing, kicking and throwing a glass vase at her. Combs apologized over the weekend for his actions in the video -- but some critics, including Bonds, didn't buy his Instagram apology.\n\n\"I think he said what people wanted to hear, not what he felt,\" Bonds said. He also told Morgan that he did not find the video of Combs' 2016 assault surprising, noting, \"I've seen things to this nature before.\"\n\nBonds, whom Ventura named in her lawsuit, described multiple alleged accounts of Combs' violence toward the women in his close circles -- including an incident with Porter in front of the Beverly Hills Hotel. He did not share when the alleged incident happened, but said the former partners were fighting in a vehicle.\n\n\"Kim got out the car like nothing happened, and she fixed her hair, and she told him, 'I want to see you explain to the media that scratch I'm gonna put across your face if you put your hands on me again,'\" Bonds recalled.\n\nHe added: \"That was Kim's attitude ... she realized that what [Combs] had to explain meant more to him than anything. Once she realized she had that power, she said, 'Nah... no more.'\"\n\nSince Ventura's complaint in November, more women have come forward with allegations of sexual assault, among other accusations of illegal behavior, against Combs.\n\n\"When you have a problem with every woman that you're dealing with, then I think that problem is inside of you,\" Bonds said Monday.\n\nWhile Bonds did not go into too much detail about other mounting allegations against Combs -- including sex-trafficking -- he said he feels more revelations about his former boss' behavior will come to light.\n\nBonds concluded his \"Piers Morgan Uncensored\" appearance by saying, \"I don't think he belongs in prison. I think he needs help.\"\n\nAmid the controversies, Combs has taken hits to both his professional and personal lives. The disturbing CNN footage prompted New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday to consider rescinding Combs' key to the city. Stationary bike company Peloton also reportedly pulled Combs' music from its exercise classes in the wake of the hotel video.\n\nAdditionally, other names in the hip-hop community have taken aim at Combs' Instagram apology.\n\n\"Diddy, how [are] we supposed to believe anything that comes outta your mouth?,\" Charlamagne Tha God said on \"The Breakfast Club\" over the weekend.\n\nRapper 50 Cent, who previously shaded Combs and his son King Combs, shared a portion of Bonds' interview on Instagram. \"Brother love, brother love, brother love, this ain't looking good,\" he captioned the video.\n\nOther musicians who have spoken out about Combs since video of his 2016 assault on Ventura surfaced include Lil' Scrappy, former Bad Boy Records artist Shyne and singer Kelly Price. On Monday night, CNN added rapper Cam'ron to the mix of celebrity reactions -- though he said he didn't have much to say.\n\nOn Monday evening, Cam'ron condemned Combs' \"egregious\" actions in the 2016 security footage, but questioned why the spotlight was on him.\n\n\"I don't really know Puff,\" he told anchor Abby Phillip before promoting his YouTube show. \"For me to tell you how Puff acting and all that, I don't know. I never was signed to him.\"\n\nHe added in the now-viral segment: \"Who's the talent agent for this joint? You think I be sitting around watching what Diddy do ... who booked me for this joint?\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [],

God help us all (praying hands emoji) [sic].'\n\nModel Emily Ratajkowski branded him a 'monster' on social media.\n\nAubrey O'Day - who has been a vocal critic of Combs for years - tweeted: 'The picture is getting a lot more clear for you all I can imagine.'\n\n'Thank you @CassieSuper for opening this door,' she later added.\n\nDuring a heated segment on the View on Monday, Ana Navarro slammed those who also 'enabled' and 'justified' Combs' alleged behavior over the years.\n\n'Shame on all the people around Sean Combs who have enabled, justified and looked the other way on all of this type of behavior for decades. These whispers have been around for decades,' she fumed.\n\n'The LAPD might not be able to charge him, but we are able to shun him. He should be treated like the social leper and criminal he is. We saw him commit assault.\n\n'I don't want to see him in any restaurant. I don't want to see him at any awards show. I'm not going to buy any brand that he's associated with.'\n\nMaria Shriver tweeted: 'Saying this is disturbing is an understatement. It makes me want to throw up.\n\n'Domestic violence is about the abuser. Period. End of story.'\n\nShortly after the assault video came to light, Ventura's husband, Alex Fine penned on Instagram: 'Men who hit women aren't men. Men who enable it and protect those people aren't men.'\n\nThis comes months after Combs was accused of raping and physically abusing his ex over a period of ten years.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in November, contains a trigger warning on the front due to the extreme nature of the allegations, and included claims of him 'beating her, plying her with drugs and forcing her to have sex with male prostitutes as Combs filmed'.\n\nIt was also claimed that Ventura, who was 19 when she met Combs, was raped 'in her own home after she tried to leave him' and 'endured over a decade of his violent behavior and disturbed demands'.\n\nShe later said: 'I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control. I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support.'\n\nLast week, footage from CNN showed Combs physically assaulting Ventura, as he grabbed, shoved, dragged and kicked her while at a hotel.\n\nAs she left a hotel room and walked towards the elevators, he was filmed following her, before grabbing her and throwing her to the floor.\n\nHe then kicked her, grabbed her belongings and kicking her again as she lay on the ground.\n\nThe publication notes that, according to the video, four seconds transpire between the two kicks.\n\nCombs was then seen dragging Ventura back towards their hotel room - she later returned to the scene and picked up a hotel phone, before he reappeared and shoved her in a corner.\n\nMoments later, he threw something taken from the table in the area towards her.\n\nHe has since offered an apology in a video posted over the weekend, in which he declared: 'I was f***ed up. I mean, I hit rock bottom. But I make no excuses. My behavior in that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.\n\n'I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, I'm disgusted now.\n\n'I went and I sought professional help, started going to therapy, I've been going to rehab. I had to ask God for His mercy and grace.\n\n'I'm so sorry. But, I've committed to being a better man, each and every day.'\n\n'I'm not asking for forgiveness, I'm truly sorry.'\n\nVentura's legal team at Wigdor LLP released a statement to Page Six over the apology, calling it 'pathetic'.\n\n'Combs' most recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt,' Meredith Firetog said. 'When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday.\n\n'That he was only compelled to \"apologize\" once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.'\n\nThe incident is noted in Ventura's lawsuit, where it is claimed that the businessman was 'extremely intoxicated and punched Ms Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye,' and that the object he threw was a glass vase.\n\nIn the documents, she claimed he was incredibly controlling, not only over her career, but also over personal details including medical records, and alleged claims that she had an MRI scan for memory loss that she claims may have been caused by a 'beating' he gave her - and that the results went straight to him.\n\nShe reportedly required 'intensive medical and psychological care to recover from the trauma she lived through' and is seeking justice for a decade of 'threats of violence, excessive use of drugs, physical and psychological abuse, and sexual slavery'.\n\nAt the time, his lawyer told Metro.co.uk: 'Mr Combs vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations.\n\n'For the past 6 months, Mr Combs, has been subjected to Ms Ventura's persistent demand of $30million, under the threat of writing a damaging book about their relationship, which was unequivocally rejected as blatant blackmail.\n\n'Despite withdrawing her initial threat, Ms Ventura has now resorted to filing a lawsuit riddled with baseless and outrageous lies, aiming to tarnish Mr Combs' reputation and seeking a pay day.'\n\nIn response to the statement, Ventura's lawyer stated to PA News Agency that Combs 'offered Ms Ventura eight figures to silence her and prevent the filing of this lawsuit.'\n\nHe said: 'She rejected his efforts and decided to give a voice to all woman who suffer in silence. Ms Ventura should be applauded for her bravery.'\n\nHer team added that Ventura's 'ability and willingness to speak up against the abuse she suffered' is a 'testament to her strength and resilience'.\n\n'No human should have to endure what Ms Ventura has endured.'\n\nFollowing the initial lawsuit, several separate sexual abuse lawsuits have been filed - a second accused him of drugging and date raping a college student, before sharing a 'revenge porn'-style video of the alleged abuse.\n\nA third accused him of rape and assault, with Combs accused of 'assaulting and choking' an anonymous woman 'to the point that she passed out', while a fourth lawsuit alleged that he gang-raped a 17-year-old girl.\n\nHis representatives have slammed all the sexual assault allegations when previously approached.\n\nMetro.co.uk has approached Combs' reps for comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us

Already having been given quite a bit to drink, the plaintiff says she was encouraged to partake of some \"very powerful\" pot by Diddy - something several other accusers have detailed as an M.O. of the Bad Boys Entertainment founder.\n\n\"Seeing Plaintiff was very intoxicated, Combs demanded Plaintiff follow him and he physically led Plaintiff to the bathroom,\" the suit details. After McKinney initially refused to perform fellatio on Combs, the rapper \"shoved her head down to his crotch\" and forced her to give him oral sex.\n\nMcKinney asserts that she passed out soon afterwards only to regain consciousness in the back of cab later.\n\nRepresentatives for the much accused and much sued Combs did not respond to request from Deadline for comment on McKinney's suit. If and when they do, this post will be updated.\n\nCalling herself a \"woman of faith,\" McKinney explains in the filing that she felt she had a \"moral obligation\" to make her encounter with Combs public after so many other women have alleged the mogul attacked them over the years.\n\nFirst reported by TMZ, McKinney's action is seeking a wide range of unspecified damages. While the more than 20 year old claims would usually be dead due to the statute of limitations, the former model is moving forward under the Big Apple's Victims of Gender Motivated Violence Act, which permits the filing of civil suits under an extended timeline.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominic_patten@deadline.com", "name": "Dominic Patten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinney,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKinney, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modus operandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fellatio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sean-combs-nov-2023-getty.jpeg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The suit was settled under undisclosed terms less than 48 hours after Ventura filed, and yet it seemingly opened the floodgates for a succession of similar lawsuits against Combs, who's since been accused by multiple plaintiffs of sexual misconduct.\n\nThen, last week, surveillance footage emerged of Combs assaulting Ventura in a hotel room hallway. The rapper's attempt at an Instagram apology video could do little to stem the tide against him. For anyone who was still giving him the benefit of the doubt at this point, that video was the last straw. And now, as a result of the lawsuits, federal raids, and hard video evidence, several prominent figures and institutions are urgently reevaluating their past associations with Combs.\n\nLast year, New York City Mayor Eric Adams gave Combs a key to the city. In an interview with PIX11 on Monday, Adams said that he was \"deeply disturbed\" by the surveillance video and that he was \"taking everything under analysis\" to figure out what further action the city might take in terms of potentially rescinding the key.\n\nMayor Eric Adams May Rescind Diddy's Key To New York City\n\nThat symbolic key is far from the only honor bestowed upon the man who attempted to brand himself as some sort of humanitarian philanthropist in recent years.\n\nIn 2014, for example, he received an honorary doctorate from Howard University for his ongoing contributions to entertainment. The accolade must have felt especially sweet to Combs, considering the fact that he himself attended Howard as an undergraduate business major, but ended up leaving after two years without graduating. The Daily Beast reached out to Howard University and asked whether the school was looking into rescinding Combs' honorary degree. The school's Office of University Communications declined to comment on the record but sources indicate that it is currently under review.\n\nThe Carver Awards were similarly mum when asked directly about any plans to rescind the Child of America Award Combs was awarded at the foundation's 80th anniversary ceremony in 2018. The Daily Beast also reached out to MTV and BET to ask if any of Combs' many awards from those two networks would be revoked and we were met with radio silence.\n\nMeanwhile, Revolt, the media company Combs co-founded which for years simulcasted The Breakfast Club, has publicly distanced itself from the mogul. Combs stepped down as the chairman of Revolt last November in the wake of Ventura and two other women accusing him of sexual assault and abuse.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened and disturbed by the recent video circulation of our former chairman, Sean 'Diddy' Combs,\" Revolt wrote on Instagram last weekend. \"Even with his recent separation from Revolt, it is still our duty to address this matter, and recognize the direct impact it has on our staff, our audience, and the culture we represent.\"\n\nCharlamagne Tha God Finally Condemns Diddy After Defending His Legacy\n\nThen there's the question of Combs' clothing brands. Sometime between May 3 and this past Saturday, The Daily Beast found, seanjohn.com, the domain for Combs' long standing eponymous clothing brand, was taken offline. Now, the only place to find items from that brand are on sites like Walmart and Amazon, which still hosts a landing page touting the \"Spring Collection.\" That's a long way to fall from 2004: that year, Combs became the first Black man to win a Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award.\n\nAfter selling a 90 percent stake in Sean John to Global Brands in 2016, Combs ended up buying his by-then-bankrupt label back in 2021 for $7.5 million, but by 2023, Sean John was already once again in a skid -- even before the allegations against Combs came down the pipeline.\n\n\"Big box retail stores are always considering what's relevant and Sean John was no longer remotely popular with consumers. The brand lost its swagger,\" Ted Jenkin, president of Exit Stage Left Advisors, told FOX News Business in April. \"In light of recent events, it's unlikely we will see the Sean John brand anywhere but on random websites.\"\n\nDiddy's 'Apology' Is Only Happening Because He Got Caught\n\nAfter severing ties with his C\u00eeroc vodka or DeLe\u00f3n tequila brands earlier this year as well, Combs' music may be the last vestige of his once sprawling business empire. The Daily Beast reached out to Spotify to ask if Combs' music would be removed in light of recent events and it sure doesn't seem like it -- though it's hard to imagine how many people are casually throwing on his biggest hits this week.\n\nA representative from the company directed us to a policy that explained that the platform would not remove someone's content on the basis of an artist's offline behavior alone. Spotify, its rules explain, only removes content if it violates platform rules or local laws. After all, R. Kelly's music is also still available on Spotify, and Kelly's behind bars.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Diddy tracks will be playing during your next Peloton ride. After customers complained about the presence of his music, Peloton reportedly posted a statement on its private members Facebook page that promised: \"We take this issue very seriously and can confirm Peloton has paused the use of Sean Combs' music, as well as removed the Bad Boy Entertainment Artist Series, on our platform.\"\n\nThe long and short of it is that Combs hasn't just jeopardized -- or flat-out jettisoned -- many of his revenue streams due to his deeply disturbing conduct, he's also lost friends and associates.\n\nMisa Hylton, Combs' ex and the mother of his son, Justin, said on Tuesday that the violent video of Combs and Ventura had left her \"heartbroken that Cassie must relive the horror of her abuse.\" Hylton added, via her Instagram caption, that her \"heart goes out to [Ventura]. I know exactly how she feels, and through my empathy, it has triggered my own trauma.\"\n\nDiddy's Ex Breaks Silence on Cassie Abuse Video\n\nOne-time music industry friends like 50 Cent and Aubrey O'Day have expressed their disgust with Diddy's actions, and even outspoken radio host Charlamagne Tha God, who technically used to work for Diddy, has definitively planted a flag. \"Can't believe anything that comes out of Diddy's mouth,\" Charlamagne said this week.\n\nIn the end, all Combs is really left with are friends like rapper Cam'ron, who embarrassed himself in spectacular fashion on CNN this week.\n\n\"He didn't do nothing to me,\" Cam'ron said, when asked what he thought of Combs' apology video, before sipping from a container of Pink Horse Power sex supplement on camera. \"You need to ask Cassie if she accepts the apology.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

After customers complained about the presence of his music, Peloton reportedly posted a statement on its private members Facebook page that promised: \"We take this issue very seriously and can confirm Peloton has paused the use of Sean Combs' music, as well as removed the Bad Boy Entertainment Artist Series, on our platform.\"\n\nThe long and short of it is that Combs hasn't just jeopardized -- or flat-out jettisoned -- many of his revenue streams due to his deeply disturbing conduct, he's also lost friends and associates.\n\nMisa Hylton, Combs' ex and the mother of his son, Justin, said on Tuesday that the violent video of Combs and Ventura had left her \"heartbroken that Cassie must relive the horror of her abuse.\" Hylton added, via her Instagram caption, that her \"heart goes out to [Ventura]. I know exactly how she feels, and through my empathy, it has triggered my own trauma.\"\n\nOne-time music industry friends like 50 Cent and Aubrey O'Day have expressed their disgust with Diddy's actions, and even outspoken radio host Charlamagne Tha God, who technically used to work for Diddy, has definitively planted a flag. \"Can't believe anything that comes out of Diddy's mouth,\" Charlamagne said this week.\n\nIn the end, all Combs is really left with are friends like rapper Cam'ron, who embarrassed himself in spectacular fashion on CNN this week.\n\n\"He didn't do nothing to me,\" Cam'ron said, when asked what he thought of Combs' apology video, before sipping from a container of Pink Horse Power sex supplement on camera. \"You need to ask Cassie if she accepts the apology.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_(TV_network)", "type":

But of course, as we heard, he came back to the hotel, and he paid to get the footage -- but didn't know, which Cassie said inside her complaint, that they gave her a copy of the footage also,\" said Bonds.\n\nAccording to Ventura's bombshell civil lawsuit that was filed in November 2023 and quickly settled, the \"Me & U\" singer alleged Combs paid the InterContinental Hotel $50,000 for the newly surfaced hallway footage.\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram on May 19, Combs issued an apology and said he takes \"full responsibility\" for the \"inexcusable\" behavior. However, Bonds isn't sure how sorry he feels.\n\n\"When you go through life just paying your way out, I really feel like he wasn't sorry about that. Yeah, he might be sorry now. He's sorry that he got caught,\" said Combs' former bodyguard.\n\n\"If that was a one time incident, then I would say accept his apology. But I think, in that apology, he said what he thought people wanted to hear,\" added Bonds.\n\nA representative for Combs did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.\n\nIn the surveillance video, taken at the since-closed InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, Combs grabs Ventura by the neck and throws her to the ground before kicking her and grabbing both her purse and suitcase. He then kicks her again, starts dragging her to the room, lets go and later throws an object at Ventura before walking away.\n\nVentura outlined an incident that matches the altercation seen in the video footage in her lawsuit, which accused Combs of rape, sex trafficking and domestic violence.\n\nThe lawsuit says that in 2016, Combs \"became extremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye\" while in a hotel.\n\n\"After he fell asleep, Ms. Ventura tried to leave the hotel room, but as she exited, Mr. Combs awoke and began screaming at Ms. Ventura,\" the lawsuit claims. \"He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her. He grabbed at her, and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her, causing glass to crash around them as she ran to the elevator to escape.\"\n\nPer the lawsuit, Ventura managed to get into the elevator and she took a cab to her apartment.\n\n\"Upon realizing that her running away would cause Mr. Combs to be even angrier with her, and completely stuck in his vicious cycle of abuse, Ms. Ventura returned to the hotel with the intention of apologizing for running away from her abuser,\" the complaint claims. \"When she returned, hotel security staff urged her to get back into a cab and go to her apartment, suggesting that they had seen the security footage showing Mr. Combs beating Ms. Ventura and throwing glass at her in the hotel hallway.\"\n\nIHG Hotels previously told PEOPLE in a statement about the video, \"This hotel is no longer under IHG management, and we do not have any access to prior incident records or footage.\"\n\nVentura's attorney, Douglas H. Wigdor, also told PEOPLE in a statement about the footage, \"The gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light.\"\n\nCombs' apology came in the form of a video posted to Instagram alongside the caption, \"I'm truly sorry.\"\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life,\" he said. \"Sometimes you gotta do that. I was f---ed up. I mean I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\"\n\nThe Bad Boy Records founder continued, \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.\"\n\n\"Disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help, going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry, but I'm committed to be a better man. Each and every day,\" Combs added.\n\nHe concluded the statement by stating that he is \"not asking for forgiveness\" and was \"truly sorry.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterContinental", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "InterContinental"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Aircraft_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Aircraft Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/HJj7pqAnmedI0sUAYoazyV-74mw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/diddy-cassie-5-081e9d01d8ab44138441ee9ff0c1e0c9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 314, "textEnd": 320}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 998, "textEnd": 1004}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

In the filing, she claimed she connected with Diddy at a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in New York City and he subsequently invited her to his music studio.\n\nMcKinney said she left the event with Diddy to go to the studio, where some of his colleagues were present. The model claimed that the group was drinking Hennessy and passing joints around the room. McKinney smoked a portion of the joint and alleged it felt \"very powerful,\" which made her feel like she was floating. In the filing, McKinney shared that she believes the joint was laced with a narcotic or some other drug, per the outlet.\n\nAfter taking a hit, McKinney claimed that Diddy demanded she follow him into the bathroom. He allegedly forced himself on her and kissed her before putting his crotch in her face and demanded that she \"suck it.\" McKinney said she refused Diddy's advancement but she claimed the music mogul pushed her head down and forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nMcKinney claimed after she walked away she started to feel lightheaded and lost consciousness. She shared that the next thing she remembered was waking up in a taxi and realizing she had been sexually assaulted. McKinney did not elaborate if she was referring to the alleged oral sex encounter or another sexual act while she was unconscious.\n\nAfter her alleged encounter with Diddy, McKinney claimed that she was blackballed from the modeling industry. She dealt with depression and contemplated suicide in 2004.\n\nMcKinney shared that she was inspired to come forward after she learned of the lawsuits filed by Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura and others. (Diddy has vehemently denied the previous allegations made against him.)\n\nUs Weekly has reached out to Diddy for comment on McKinney's claims but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\nDiddy has found himself in hot water lately. In addition to the several lawsuits against him, he recently made headlines after 2016 security footage showed him abusing Cassie, now 37, was released via CNN. After the video dropped on Friday, May 17, Diddy took to social media to apologize for his actions.\n\n\"It's difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, sometimes you gotta do that,\" Diddy said in a Sunday, May 19, Instagram video. \"I was f -- ked up. I mean, I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here: joinsubtext.com/forbes.\n\n\"WTF at some point you gotta just do the right thing,\" Jackson wrote in an Instagram post about proceeds from the docuseries going to victims of sexual assault and rape.\n\nCombs was first accused of abuse, rape and sex trafficking by his longterm ex-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, in November. The suit was settled for an undisclosed amount one day later. A lawyer for the rapper at the time said Combs \"vehemently denies these offensive and outrageous allegations\" and accused Ventura of \"seeking a payday,\" but CNN last week released a video that showed Combs shoving, kicking dragging Ventura by the hair in the hallway of a hotel back in 2016. Combs on Sunday issued an apology video calling his behavior \"disgusting\" and saying he was \"truly sorry.\" After Ventura, three more lawsuits were filed accusing Combs of abuse, rape or sex trafficking, all of which have been denied by Combs. Two of the other accusations include claims Combs drugged them. In February, a $30 million lawsuit from music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones accused Combs of sexually harassing him, drugging attendees to his house parties and running a \"sex-trafficking venture\" that included a number of parties with sex workers, minors and illegal drugs.\n\nA poster advertising a Netflix documentary titled \"Diddy Do It?\" went viral on social media last March only to later be debunked and called \"just a parody\" by its creator. The poster included what appeared to be official Netflix branding and a \"streaming now\" tagline -- and drove up search traffic for \"Diddy Do It Netflix,\" \"Diddy Do It\" and \"Netflix Diddy\" -- but was created in jest. Graphic designer and artist Kode Abdo, who posts his work online under the name BossLogic, created the image.\n\nJackson and Combs have had a long-running feud that has only intensified since the allegations against Diddy began. Jackson has posted a number of jabs at Combs in the last several months, including a commentary on the Ventura video. After the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office posted it will not charge Combs with crimes shown in the video because the statute of limitations had passed in California, Jackson wrote \"This is why they put out that tape out, they know they can't charge him with what we saw, but they know we can't [unsee]", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors":

'Now a lot of stuff is just coming back to him.'\n\nOn Sunday, Combs released a pathetic, self-pitying video statement in which he 'apologized' for viciously beating his then-girlfriend Cassie.\n\nThis, after decades of Diddy's rebuttals and reverse accusations, claiming Cassie -- with her allegations of systematic rape and violence -- was attempting blackmail, revenge, extortion.\n\nEveryone knew. He has long told the world exactly who and what he is.\n\nThe recent raids on his L.A. and Miami estates have been a long time coming.\n\nTime's up for Sean 'Diddy' Combs - and he knows it. As must his longtime friends, associates, colleagues, employees, politicos and an entire celebrity industrial complex that propped up this monster for decades - Jennifer Lopez included (pictured in 2000).\n\nOn Sunday, Combs released a pathetic, self-pitying video statement in which he 'apologized' for viciously beating his then-girlfriend Cassie (pictured in 2016). This, after decades of Diddy's rebuttals and reverse accusations, claiming Cassie was attempting blackmail, revenge, extortion.\n\nYet here was New York City mayor Eric Adams, giving Combs a key to the city just last September.\n\n'Sean Combs is the embodiment of New York City attitude,' Adams said at the ceremony. '[He] has proven to be a singular, generational talent.'\n\nPlease. Adams is a former New York City police officer. You can't tell me he didn't know anything about Combs. He has been on the NYPD's radar since at least 1991, when nine people died and 29 were injured at an overfilled NYC basketball event Combs promoted.\n\nCassie, by the way, sued just two months after Combs got the key, in November 2023.\n\nIt was filed one day before a special New York provision allowing victims of sexual abuse, whose allegations would otherwise have fallen outside the statute of limitations, was to end.\n\nThat timing, to me, suggests that Cassie really struggled with her decision to file -- and that she likely remains very afraid of Combs.\n\nWith good reason. His violent behavior has been known to law enforcement for decades, yet he has never been found guilty for any of it.\n\nHis rap sheet continues through the 1990s and beyond: alleged shootings, beatings, violent assaults and death threats, the explosion of a car bomb in rival-rapper Kid Cudi's vehicle -- and, of course, that infamous nightclub shoot-out involving J.Lo. We'll get into that in a bit.\n\nMore recently, Combs has denied, denied, and denied Cassie's claims -- one particularly vicious detail has him stomping on her face, beating her to a pulp until she bled profusely and threw up, all witnessed by at least one of Combs's bodyguards -- but now he can deny no more.\n\nHarrowing security cam video from an L.A. hotel, dated March 5, 2016, was leaked to CNN on Friday.\n\nSeventy-two hours later -- did he really need time to think this through? -- Adams said he is 'considering' revoking the New York City key. What more proof does he need?\n\nThis footage is beyond damning. We see Diddy, wrapped only in a bath towel, grabbing Cassie by the neck, pushing her to the floor, and kicking her quite literally while she was down -- immobile.\n\nHe then pulls her by her shirt and drags her along the hallway, where the assault continues until someone gets off the elevator on their floor.\n\nThat's how emboldened Combs has been: comfortable enough to unleash grievous bodily harm against a defenseless woman in a very public place, half-naked, cameras everywhere.\n\nNew York City mayor Eric Adams gave Combs a key to the city just last September. 'Sean Combs is the embodiment of New York City attitude,' Adams said at the ceremony. Adams is a former New York City police officer. You can't tell me he didn't know anything about Combs.\n\nHe reportedly paid the LA Intercontinental Hotel, the site of this brutal beatdown, $50,000 for the footage.\n\nWho sold it to Combs? How many hotel employees and execs were involved in this cover-up?\n\nIf you haven't already seen it, watch the video. You'll never look at Combs the same way again. He is vile, irredeemable, and should be put away for life.\n\nYet in his apology video, he paints himself as the lone victim here.\n\n'It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life,' he says, voice all too casual.\n\nTears? None.\n\n'Sometimes,' he says, 'you gotta do that. I was f**ked up. I mean, I hit rock bottom.'\n\nPoor him.\n\n'But I make no excuse,' says the man who has spent years lying and making excuses. 'I take full responsibility for my actions in that video'.\n\nIt goes on like that: I, I, I. Me, me, me.\n\nNot once does he mention Cassie, or the pain he caused her, or what he can do to make amends.\n\nCombs claims to have gone to therapy and rehab -- no dates, no details, no insights offered -- and then, of course, to have asked God for 'grace'.\n\nEven God would like Sean Combs to lose his number.\n\nThe Cassie video is a bombshell, for good and for ill.\n\nThe LA County District Attorney's Office quickly announced that Combs cannot be prosecuted, because at eight years old, this video falls outside the statute of limitations.\n\nUnconscionable. But this is how violence against women is still viewed -- too bad, really, but there's a time limit on holding so-called men who rape and brutalize to account.\n\nWomen have to matter more than this. It's time to eliminate the statute of limitations for domestic violence and sex crimes.\n\nInvestigators are no longer hamstrung by the 'he-said-she-said' claims of 20 or 30 years ago. We live in a world with security cameras everywhere. We all carry personal recording devices and GPS systems in our phones. Evidence is often multiple.\n\nYears after an assault, as we see with the Cassie video, incontrovertible proof can emerge that a claimant is telling the truth, and that a dangerous predator needs to be taken off the streets.\n\nIn the 1999 nightclub incident, three people were shot, one young woman in the face, Combs the prime suspect and J.Lo his alleged 'gun mule'. Lopez was arrested, as was Combs. She spent 14 hours in custody before being released without charges. (Pictured in 2000).\n\nLopez has so far remained silent about what happened that night and what really went on in their two-year relationship. She's not the only one. His great pal Ashton Kutcher (pictured in 2003), who defended convicted rapist Danny Masterson, has also remained silent.\n\nCombs should be in handcuffs immediately. Shame on every politician, prosecutor and lawmaker who fails to correct that.\n\nDespite his NYC rap sheet, Combs wasn't known as a violent criminal nationally until 1998, after his arrest for brutally beating Interscope record exec Steve Stout in 1998.\n\nWhy? Combs didn't like the edit for one of his music videos.\n\n'He punched me in the face and then he grabbed the phone and bashed me in the head with it,' Stoute told the LA Times in 1999.\n\n'If somebody can get away with walking into the headquarters of the world's biggest record company and beating up a senior executive over a disagreement,' Stoute said, 'I guarantee you this is going to be a great business for criminals to thrive in.'\n\nTruer words.\n\nCombs was sentenced to one day of anger management. Did he have police or prosecutors on his payroll -- then and now?\n\nNext up: The 1999 Times Square nightclub incident in which three people were shot, one young woman in the face, Combs the prime suspect and J.Lo his alleged 'gun mule'.\n\nLopez was arrested, as was Combs. She spent 14 hours in custody before being released without charges -- but not before demanding someone fetch her some cuticle cream. Priorities.\n\nCombs was found not guilty, but his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 'Shyne' Barrow -- long suspected to be the fall guy -- did ten years.\n\nVictim Natania Reuben, to this day, contends that it was Combs who shot her, not Shyne.\n\n'I literally watched them pull out the guns,' she said in March. 'I had a clear point of view. I mean, for God's sake -- I got shot in my nose.'\n\nAs for J.Lo: A recent lawsuit filed by Rodney 'Lil Rod' Jones alleges that on the night of the 1999 club shooting, it was Lopez who 'carried the gun into the club for [Combs] and passed him the gun after he got into an altercation with another individual.'\n\nLopez has so far remained silent about what happened that night and what really went on in their two-year relationship.\n\nShe's not the only one. His great pal Ashton Kutcher, who defended convicted rapist Danny Masterson, has also remained silent.\n\nAnd what of the nearly 30 artists such as John Legend, H.E.R, Mary J. Blige, and The Weeknd who collaborated on Combs's laughably-tiled 'Love' album last year?\n\nDiddy partied with Princes William and Harry, with Trump and the world's top CEOs and stars.\n\nIf allegations of a sprawling sex trafficking ring are true, well -- how many people knew?\n\nDiddy partied with princes, with Trump and the world's top CEOs and stars. (Pictured in 2005).\n\nPictured with Kanye West and Prince Harry in 2007.\n\nIf allegations of a sprawling sex trafficking ring are true, well - how many people knew? (Pictured with Usher in 2002).\n\nAs the allegations and accusations against Combs mount -- everything from Usher's inference that he was exposed to dark events under Combs's mentorship, to sex trafficking and rape allegations involving minors, to Lil Rod's claims Combs and actor Cuba Gooding Jr. sexually assaulted him -- well, clearly a federal indictment is in the offing.\n\nJustice, it seems, will finally now prevail. But at what cost? How much human carnage could have been spared?\n\nAs Combs undoubtedly knows, he's in for as much hurt, if not more, as he's allegedly inflicted over the years.\n\nEven the most hardened prisoners don't take kindly to woman-beaters and rapists.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

FAKE APOLOGY AFTER COMBS BRUTALLY BEATS, KICKS, CASSIE ON VIDEO", "body": "In November of last year, R&B singer Cassie filed an explosive lawsuit, accusing her ex, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs of abuse, rape, and other sexual misconduct. Combs settled the suit for an undisclosed amount just a day after Cassie Ventura filed.\n\nCombs said the settlement was in no way an admission of wrongdoing, \"We have decided to resolve this matter amicably, I wish Cassie and her family all the best.\" 5 more lawsuits followed Ventura's, and federal authorities raided the rapper's homes based on the allegations of sex trafficking they contained.\n\nNow, a 2016 video from the Century City InterContinental hotel has surfaced, showing Combs brutally beating Ventura as she tried to leave the hotel without him. Ventura is seen leaving the room with her bags, and moments later Combs follows her into the hallway, wearing only a towel. Combs throws Ventura to the ground, kicks her, and drags her back to the room by her hoodie.\n\nFaced with proof of his abuse, Combs quickly changed his tune and took to social media with an apology video. Many have called the video completely disingenuous, and Combs' legal team is said to be bracing for the possibility of more footage of bad behavior coming to light.\n\nJoining Nancy Grace Today:\n\n\"Crime Stories with Nancy Grace\" on Fox Nation is also a national radio show on SiriusXM channel 111, airing for two hours daily starting at 12 p.m. EST.

He said he had sought therapy and entered rehab shortly afterward, and was working to \"be a better man.\"\n\nThe violent video matched the description of an incident Ventura detailed in a lawsuit settled in November. Combs had denied Ventura's allegations. His attorneys said at the time that the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing.\"\n\nAs the video made its way online, one person wrote in a post on X, \"There's absolutely nothing genuine about that apology video Diddy just dropped.\" Another added: \"What yall witnessed was manipulation. The first thing he did was center himself.\"\n\nAubrey O'Day, a former member of the Diddy-created girl group Danity Kane, shared a photo of Combs' previous denial in her own critical post on X. \"Diddy did not apologize to Cassie. He apologized to the world for seeing what he did.\"\n\nThe footage showed Combs chasing a woman down a hotel hallway, pulling her to the ground and beating and kicking her before dragging her by her sweatshirt.\n\n\"This is the classic cycle of domestic violence,\" Joanna Otero-Cruz, president of the Philadelphia-based Women Against Abuse domestic violence center, said of the apology. Otero-Cruz, who said she has worked in the field for at least 15 years, said apologies are common in gender violence situations and are often used to manipulate victims and the public.\n\n\"They're apologizing and they want to create sympathy from others, apathy from others, all of those things,\" Otero-Cruz said. \"This is the typical behavior of someone who perpetuates abuse. We're just seeing it in public now.\"\n\nThe release of the video came just six months after Ventura sued Combs, alleging that the music mogul had sexually and physically abused her during the course of their relationship. Ventura alleged that, from 2007 to 2018, Combs raped her, beat her, trafficked her and controlled her life. She filed her lawsuit on Nov. 16, 2023, under New York state's Adult Survivors Act, which gives adult alleged victims of sexual violence a one-year window to file civil claims regardless of the statute of limitations.\n\nHe denied the allegations and called them \"sickening.\" They settled the suit a day after it was filed. Combs is facing lawsuits from three other women in New York accusing him of sexual assault, sexual trafficking and other criminal activity. His former producer has also accused him in a lawsuit of sexually harassing, drugging and threatening him. He is also the subject of a federal investigation related to multiple allegations including sex trafficking and sexual assault. Combs has previously denied all of the sexual assault allegations.\n\nThe accusations against Combs have renewed conversations about abuse carried out by powerful men and the difficulties Black women face when seeking to hold their abusers accountable.\n\nResearch has shown that Black women experience domestic violence at disproportionate rates compared with other ethnic and racial groups. They are killed by men at three times the rate of white women, for example, according to the Women's Leadership and Resource Center at the University of Illinois, Chicago.\n\n\"Black women as a whole experience domestic violence and intimate partner violence higher than any other ethnicity. Yet, oftentimes, Black women are faced with various biases. They don't look like the perfect victim,\" said Nel-Sylvia Guzman, deputy director of The Safe Sisters Circle, a center for domestic violence survivors in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"For Black women survivors, they're battling so many parts of culture, the system fighting against them. That's why many of them don't come forward and, if they do, it's so many years later, like Cassie did.\"\n\nMeredith Firetog, an attorney for Ventura, said in a statement Sunday that Comb's apology was \"more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\" She added: \"That he was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\"\n\nAaron Dyer, Combs' attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlong with social media users and advocates for domestic abuse victims, Combs' apology has also prompted criticism from public relations experts who have detailed the flaws in it. Daniel Brackins, of the global marketing company Interpublic Group, said Combs' apology seemed to lack empathy, skirted accountability and did not include plans to \"make things right.\"\n\nValese Jones, founder of the Texas-based Sincerely Nicole Media public relations company, shared similar sentiments.\n\n\"I believe the video has done more harm than good,\" Jones told NBC News. \"The apology just doesn't come across as sincere at all. He was apologizing to the general public because it was about his public image. I don't think this apology was smart.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura",

This means our Instructors are no longer using his music in any newly produced classes.\"\n\nOlder classes, which used music from Combs, will not be pulled from circulation, however.\n\nThe decision to pull back from the entertainer follows security footage from 2016 aired on CNN, which showed Combs attacking Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel. The video shows Combs chase, grab, shove, drag and kick Ventura, who was then his girlfriend.\n\n\"My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" Combs said in an Instagram post Sunday.\n\nVentura has also accused Combs of rape in a lawsuit filed last November. He also faces additional civil lawsuits on a range of charges.\n\nPeloton is the latest company to cut ties with Combs since the allegations began piling up. Hulu, which has planned a reality show centered on the music mogul, terminated its relationship with Combs. And liquor company Diageo has pulled back from its affiliation with Combs as well. Products with his name at Macy's and Walmart have disappeared or been heavily marked down.\n\nEven New York City is reportedly considering rescinding the key to the city given to Combs in 2023, with Mayor Eric Adams saying \"We've never rescinded a key before, but we are now sitting down to see what the next steps forward are going to be.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Peloton has distanced itself from an artist.

He can manipulate anything, anyone,\" said Roger Bonds, Combs' former head of security. \"Money and power is all he's all about.\"\n\nBonds, who served on Combs' security staff for nearly a decade, from 2003 to 2012, said in a recent interview with Piers Morgan that Combs' ex-girlfriend Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura was one of the people manipulated by the Bad Boy Records co-founder. He also claimed on Monday that Ventura -- who sued the rapper in November, alleging assault -- wasn't the only woman who allegedly suffered physical violence from Combs.\n\nLate model and actor Kim Porter was also subjected to the hip-hop star's violent attacks, Bonds alleged. The ex-bodyguard said he witnessed Combs \"smack\" and \"grab\" Porter. Combs and Porter were romantically linked from 1994 to 2007 and share three children. Their son Christian \"King\" Combs was sued for alleged sexual assault in April. Porter died in 2018 of lobar pneumonia. She was 47.\n\nA representative for Combs did not immediately respond Tuesday to The Times' request for comment.\n\nBonds told Morgan he saw Combs get violent with women \"around four or five times\" during his tenure and added, \"I've seen him get physical ... grab 'em up.\"\n\nCombs, who is facing several sexual assault lawsuits and a federal probe, became the center of renewed controversy last week when CNN published hotel security footage showing the 2016 assault alleged by Ventura. During the incident, which the singer detailed in her since-settled lawsuit, Combs can be seen chasing, grabbing, kicking and throwing a glass vase at her. Combs apologized over the weekend for his actions in the video -- but some critics, including Bonds, didn't buy his Instagram apology.\n\n\"I think he said what people wanted to hear, not what he felt,\" Bonds said. He also told Morgan that he did not find the video of Combs' 2016 assault surprising, noting, \"I've seen things to this nature before.\"\n\nBonds, whom Ventura named in her lawsuit, described multiple alleged accounts of Combs' violence toward the women in his close circles -- including an incident with Porter in front of the Beverly Hills Hotel. He did not share when the alleged incident happened, but said the former partners were fighting in a vehicle.\n\n\"Kim got out the car like nothing happened, and she fixed her hair, and she told him, 'I want to see you explain to the media that scratch I'm gonna put across your face if you put your hands on me again,'\" Bonds recalled.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Boy_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bad Boy Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobar_pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lobar pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beverly_Hills_Hotel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Beverly Hills Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/290/29028/2902885.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Caught in a web of lawsuits, sexual assault allegations, and a federal investigation, Combs has been slapped with yet another lawsuit: model Crystal McKinley alleges he drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2003.\n\nIn the filing, McKinley claims that in 2003, when she was 22 years old, the model was invited to a Men's Fashion Week event in New York City. There she met Combs, who invited her back to his studio. McKinley asserts that at the studio, Combs and several colleagues were drinking Hennessy and smoking joints; she suspects the cannabis was laced with \"a narcotic or other drug,\" as it felt \"very powerful.\"\n\nShe says Combs then demanded she follow him to a bathroom, where he forced himself on her and tried to physically push her into oral sex. Because of the alcohol and drugs, McKinley says she felt lightheaded and lost consciousness, and later awoke in a taxi, realizing she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nMcKinley alleges that due to her lack of compliance, she was \"blackballed\" from the modeling industry, which, coupled with the assault, left her severely depressed. She subsequently attempted suicide in 2004.\n\nThe filing specifically references other lawsuits against Combs, like Cassie Ventura's and Joi Dickerson-Neal's, which inspired McKinley to file her account, as she \"knew she had a moral obligation to speak up.\"\n\nDespite initially denying all the allegations against him, Combs released an apology video on Sunday after footage surfaced of him beating Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway in 2016. The footage matches Ventura's account of the event in her lawsuit against Combs, which was settled just a day after it was filed.\n\nIn addition to the deluge of civil lawsuits filed against him, Combs is also the subject of a federal investigation, which culminated with the Department of Homeland Security raiding his Florida and California homes in April.\n\nShare on:\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link", "source": {"uri": "digitalmusicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Music News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_king@digitalmusicnews.com", "name": "Ashley King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William McKinley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/diddy-hit-with-another-sexual-assault-lawsuit-from-model-alleging-rape-in-2003-feat.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He said he had sought therapy and entered rehab shortly afterward, and was working to \"be a better man.\"\n\nThe violent video matched the description of an incident Ventura detailed in a lawsuit settled in November. Combs had denied Ventura's allegations. His attorneys said at the time that the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing.\"\n\nAs the video made its way online, one person wrote in a post on X, \"There's absolutely nothing genuine about that apology video Diddy just dropped.\" Another added: \"What yall witnessed was manipulation. The first thing he did was center himself.\"\n\nAubrey O'Day, a former member of the Diddy-created girl group Danity Kane, shared a photo of Combs' previous denial in her own critical post on X. \"Diddy did not apologize to Cassie. He apologized to the world for seeing what he did.\"\n\nThe footage showed Combs chasing a woman down a hotel hallway, pulling her to the ground and beating and kicking her before dragging her by her sweatshirt.\n\n\"This is the classic cycle of domestic violence,\" Joanna Otero-Cruz, president of the Philadelphia-based Women Against Abuse domestic violence center, said of the apology. Otero-Cruz, who said she has worked in the field for at least 15 years, said apologies are common in gender violence situations and are often used to manipulate victims and the public.\n\n\"They're apologizing and they want to create sympathy from others, apathy from others, all of those things,\" Otero-Cruz said. \"This is the typical behavior of someone who perpetuates abuse. We're just seeing it in public now.\"\n\nThe release of the video came just six months after Ventura sued Combs, alleging that the music mogul had sexually and physically abused her during the course of their relationship. Ventura alleged that, from 2007 to 2018, Combs raped her, beat her, trafficked her and controlled her life. She filed her lawsuit on Nov. 16, 2023, under New York state's Adult Survivors Act, which gives adult alleged victims of sexual violence a one-year window to file civil claims regardless of the statute of limitations.\n\nHe denied the allegations and called them \"sickening.\" They settled the suit a day after it was filed. Combs is facing lawsuits from three other women in New York accusing him of sexual assault, sexual trafficking and other criminal activity. His former producer has also accused him in a lawsuit of sexually harassing, drugging and threatening him. He is also the subject of a federal investigation related to multiple allegations including sex trafficking and sexual assault. Combs has previously denied all of the sexual assault allegations.\n\nThe accusations against Combs have renewed conversations about abuse carried out by powerful men and the difficulties Black women face when seeking to hold their abusers accountable.\n\nResearch has shown that Black women experience domestic violence at disproportionate rates compared with other ethnic and racial groups. They are killed by men at three times the rate of white women, for example, according to the Women's Leadership and Resource Center at the University of Illinois, Chicago.\n\n\"Black women as a whole experience domestic violence and intimate partner violence higher than any other ethnicity. Yet, oftentimes, Black women are faced with various biases. They don't look like the perfect victim,\" said Nel-Sylvia Guzman, deputy director of The Safe Sisters Circle, a center for domestic violence survivors in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"For Black women survivors, they're battling so many parts of culture, the system fighting against them. That's why many of them don't come forward and, if they do, it's so many years later, like Cassie did.\"\n\nMeredith Firetog, an attorney for Ventura, said in a statement Sunday that Comb's apology was \"more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\" She added: \"That he was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\"\n\nAaron Dyer, Combs' attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlong with social media users and advocates for domestic abuse victims, Combs' apology has also prompted criticism from public relations experts who have detailed the flaws in it. Daniel Brackins, of the global marketing company Interpublic Group, said Combs' apology seemed to lack empathy, skirted accountability and did not include plans to \"make things right.\"\n\nValese Jones, founder of the Texas-based Sincerely Nicole Media public relations company, shared similar sentiments.\n\n\"I believe the video has done more harm than good,\" Jones told NBC News. \"The apology just doesn't come across as sincere at all. He was apologizing to the general public because it was about his public image. I don't think this apology was smart.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California",

But of course, as we heard, he came back to the hotel, and he paid to get the footage -- but didn't know, which Cassie said inside her complaint, that they gave her a copy of the footage also,\" said Bonds.\n\nRelated: Diddy's Former Bodyguard Claims He's Witnessed the Rapper Be Violent Toward Women '4 or 5 Times'\n\nAccording to Ventura's bombshell civil lawsuit that was filed in November 2023 and quickly settled, the \"Me & U\" singer alleged Combs paid the InterContinental Hotel $50,000 for the newly surfaced hallway footage.\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram on May 19, Combs issued an apology and said he takes \"full responsibility\" for the \"inexcusable\" behavior. However, Bonds isn't sure how sorry he feels.\n\n\"When you go through life just paying your way out, I really feel like he wasn't sorry about that. Yeah, he might be sorry now. He's sorry that he got caught,\" said Combs' former bodyguard.\n\n\"If that was a one time incident, then I would say accept his apology.

He then kicks her again, starts dragging her to the room, lets go and later throws an object at Ventura before walking away.\n\nVentura outlined an incident that matches the altercation seen in the video footage in her lawsuit, which accused Combs of rape, sex trafficking and domestic violence.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles D.A. 'Unable' to Charge Diddy for Cassie Assault Video Due to Timing of When It Occurred\n\nThe lawsuit says that in 2016, Combs \"became extremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye\" while in a hotel.\n\n\"After he fell asleep, Ms. Ventura tried to leave the hotel room, but as she exited, Mr. Combs awoke and began screaming at Ms. Ventura,\" the lawsuit claims. \"He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her. He grabbed at her, and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her, causing glass to crash around them as she ran to the elevator to escape.\"\n\nRelated: Misa Hylton Addresses Video of Diddy Assaulting Cassie as She Shares Photos of Kids: 'Their Father Needs Help'\n\nPer the lawsuit, Ventura managed to get into the elevator and she took a cab to her apartment.\n\n\"Upon realizing that her running away would cause Mr. Combs to be even angrier with her, and completely stuck in his vicious cycle of abuse, Ms. Ventura returned to the hotel with the intention of apologizing for running away from her abuser,\" the complaint claims. \"When she returned, hotel security staff urged her to get back into a cab and go to her apartment, suggesting that they had seen the security footage showing Mr. Combs beating Ms. Ventura and throwing glass at her in the hotel hallway.\"\n\nIHG Hotels previously told PEOPLE in a statement about the video, \"This hotel is no longer under IHG management, and we do not have any access to prior incident records or footage.\"\n\nRelated: Biggest Bombshells from Diddy's Lawsuits: Disturbing Allegations of Rape, Sex Trafficking and More\n\nVentura's attorney, Douglas H.

Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light.\"\n\nCombs' apology came in the form of a video posted to Instagram alongside the caption, \"I'm truly sorry.\"\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life,\" he said. \"Sometimes you gotta do that.

Here's the history of the beef between them", "body": "(CNN) -- There is no love lost between hip-hop moguls 50 Cent and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.\n\n50 Cent has long trolled Diddy on social media, most recently after CNN's publication of surveillance video showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in 2016.\n\nOn Tuesday, 50 Cent posted on social media to confirm a TMZ report that he has sold a multi-part documentary about Combs' legal troubles to Netflix. Combs is currently named in six civil lawsuits, accusing him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity, the latest of which was filed Tuesday.\n\nHe is also the target of a federal investigation carried out by a Department of Homeland Security Investigations team that handles human trafficking and other crimes, according to a senior federal law enforcement official briefed on the investigation.\n\nCombs has previously denied all allegations of wrong doing. CNN has reached out to representatives for 50 Cent and Netflix for comment.\n\nBut why the bad blood? Here's a look back at how there came to be animosity between the two men.\n\nIn 2006, 50 Cent released a diss track \"The Bomb,\" which featured sounds of gunfire and his allegation that Combs knew the identity of the killer of Christopher Wallace, a rapper known as The Notorious B.I.G., who was both a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and best friend to Combs.\n\nWallace was gunned down in Los Angeles in March 1997 as he and his crew, which included Combs, were traveling in a caravan. Combs was in a different vehicle from the one Wallace was in at the time Wallace was shot.\n\nNo one has ever been charged with the murder.\n\nIn his diss track, 50 raps, \"I guess this means I won't be invited to the white parties in the Hamptons,\" referencing Combs' famous soirees held in the upscale New York community.\n\n50 Cent has also said he believes Combs is connected to the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur.\n\nCombs called such allegations \"nonsense\" in a 2016 interview with the syndicated radio show \"The Breakfast Club.\" He has never been charged in connection to either case.\n\nFollowers of 50 are familiar with his reputation for sharp comments and social media trolling.\n\nThe rapper-turned-television-producer has made Combs a frequent target, attacking everything from his music to his age.\n\nSome believed it was mostly marketing, especially given the men's parallel career tracks and even competing vodkas at one point, Effen Vodka from 50 Cent and Ciroc, which used to be owned by Combs.\n\nBut 50 upped his comments after Combs was sued in November 2023 by Ventura, who in a now-settled civil complaint alleged that Combs raped her in 2018 and abused her over the more than decade they were in an off-and-on relationship.\n\nCombs has denied the allegations, but apologized on Sunday for the incident depicted in the surveillance video.\n\nAfter federal investigators searched Combs' homes in Miami and Los Angeles in March, 50 Cent posted on X, \"Now it's not Diddy do it, it's Diddy done. They don't come like that unless they got a case.\"\n\n\"I don't have no beef with Fif. He loves me,\" Combs said. \"Y'all can't see that he loves me? You really think that's hate? ... You know he loves me.\"\n\nHe added that he didn't take the things 50 Cent says about him seriously.\n\n\"When he does that it's like funny to me,\" Combs said. \"I don't really take it personal. I know he has a different sense of humor, and he's just not in my life. We don't have to never cross paths, and I will never say nothing negative about him, you know, because that's just not me.\"\n\nChristian Combs, who goes by King Combs, is the 26-year-old son of Diddy. Earlier this month, he released a song titled \"Pick a Side\" in support of his father and taking aim at critics like 50 Cent.\n\nThe younger Combs and his brother, Justin, were temporarily handcuffed and detained by authorities during the March search on their father's home. Neither was arrested or charged.\n\nAaron Dyer, Diddy's attorney, said in a statement to CNN at the time that \"there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs' residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.\"\n\nKing Combs appeared to profess his father's innocence in his track and took a swipe at 50 Cent.\n\n\"All that gossip sh*t is whack when all they had was 50 Cent / Who put this city on the map? / Stop lying,\" the younger Combs raps.\n\n50 Cent responded with a tongue-in-cheek post on social media.\n\n\"I feel so threatened by the things Christian is saying on his record,\" he wrote in a since-delated post on Instagram, according to Billboard. \"I'm afraid for my life, please don't hurt me guys.\"\n\nThe TMZ story about the docuseries that 50 Cent shared on Tuesday said the project will reportedly be titled, \"Diddy Do It?\"\n\n\"If more victims keep coming out I'm gonna need more episodes,\" he wrote.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

According to the lawsuit, Combs paid $50,000 for the video of the March 2016 incident so it wouldn't be released, but CNN obtained it this week and released it.\n\nThe video showed Ventura getting up from the floor and gathering her belongings, including her phone, before Combs returned and shoved her. Then he sat on a chair and threw something from a table at Ventura.\n\nCombs said he was \"disgusted then when I did it\" and remains \"disgusted now\" and has sought therapy and rehab to become \"a better man.\"\n\n\"The issue isn't that he's not, you know, saying sorry to the victims.

Adams touched on that topic in an interview with PIX11 on Monday.\n\nCombs, who was born in Harlem, was awarded the Key to the City of New York by Adams in 2023. The mayor's office in a statement said Combs was awarded the key for his \"decades of contributions to music and business, philanthropic support to underserved communities.\"\n\nBut skepticism regarding whether Combs is worthy of keeping that award has been raised following the release of the 2016 video. Adams' opinion on the assault and his reaction to it also appear crucial as he has taken initiatives to protect domestic violence victims in the city.\n\nAdams in Monday's interview stated that he thinks \"all of us were deeply disturbed by watching that chilling video of the young lady being assaulted by him.\" He also emphasized that \"the committee and team\" have \"never rescinded a key before, but we are now sitting down to see what the next steps forward are going to be.\"\n\nAdams further stated that they are \"taking everything under analysis, and the team will come back to me with final determination.\"\n\nThe interview with Adams came a day after Combs took to social media to issue an apology following the circulation of the video, Face2Face Africa reported. The rapper and music executive had initially denied allegations of rape and abuse from Ventura. Combs and Ventura started dating in 2007 and had an on-and-off relationship for over 10 years. The American music mogul signed Cassie to his label in 2005 when she was 19 and he was 37.\n\n\"My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" Combs said in a video on his Instagram account. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" he continued.\n\n\"I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nVentura, 37, initially filed a lawsuit in New York federal court alleging that Combs brought her into his \"ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle\" after she met him.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleged that Combs was \"prone to uncontrollable rage\" and physically abused her during their relationship including punching, beating, kicking and stomping on her. It alleged that Combs urged Ventura to use drugs and forced her to have sex with other men while he masturbated and filmed. The lawsuit was later dismissed after both parties reached an undisclosed settlement.", "source": {"uri": "face2faceafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Face2Face Africa"}, "authors": [{"uri": "francis_akhalbey@face2faceafrica.com", "name": "Francis Akhalbey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Adams (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPIX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WPIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Music_Videos", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Music Videos", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://face2faceafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Image-33.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The footage is from a hotel altercation in Los Angeles in 2016.\n\nVentura filed a lawsuit in New York City last November, accusing Combs of years of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.\n\nIn her lawsuit, the \"Long Way 2 Go\" singer claimed that Combs involved her in a \"ostentatious, fast-paced, and drug-fueled lifestyle,\" highlighting his \" uncontrollable rage.\" Ventura reported enduring \"savage\" beatings and alleged that Combs forced her into sexual encounters with other men while intoxicated, which he filmed and masturbated to.\n\nThe distressing hotel security footage, dated March 5, 2016, corresponds to an incident Ventura detailed in her lawsuit. This incident occurred at the InterContinental Hotel in the Century City district of Los Angeles.\n\nThe suit was swiftly settled within a day, with the terms remaining confidential.\n\nIn a statement about the settlement last November, Ventura said, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control. I want to thank my family, fans and lawyers for their unwavering support.\"\n\nIn September 2023, two months before the filing of Ventura's lawsuit, Combs was awarded with the Key to the City by Mayor Eric Adams, an award given to notable New Yorkers who actively serve the community.\n\n\"Sean Combs is the embodiment of the New York City attitude. A son of Harlem, Combs worked his way to the top, becoming a successful musical talent both in front of and behind the mic,\" said Mayor Adams.\n\n\"Sean has never forgotten where he came from,\" Adams noted. Adams called Combs a \"singular, generational talent\" and acknowledged his contributions to music, business, and philanthropy.\n\n\"Receiving the Key to the City of New York, the very city that molded me, is an honor and incredible moment in my life,\" said Combs. He spoke of his journey and the lessons learned in New York, pledging to keep supporting the community and dedicating the key to all ambitious New Yorkers.\n\n\"From growing up on the streets of Harlem to the international stage, New York's energy has always been the backdrop of my story.\"\n\nThree months after the honor and a month after settling Cassie's lawsuit, Combs was hit with three more lawsuits, prompting him to make a defensive statement on Instagram.\n\n\"Enough is enough. For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and legacy,\" the post started.\n\n\"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday,\" he continued, implying that the lawsuits are false and driven by financial motives.\n\n\"Let me be absolutely clear. I did not do any of the awful things being alleged,\" his post concluded.\n\nVentura's attorney, Meredith Firetog, who also represents the women in the new lawsuits against Combs, found the apology to be disingenuous and selfish.\n\n\"When Cassie and multiple other women came forward, he denied everything and suggested that his victims were looking for a payday,\" Firetog stated in a press statement. \"That he was only compelled to 'apologize' once his repeated denials were proven false shows his pathetic desperation, and no one will be swayed by his disingenuous words.\"\n\nCombs is among an esteemed lineup of hip-hop artists awarded the key to the city that birthed the genre and received borough proclamations, including Run D.M.C., LL Cool J, Lil Kim, Wu-Tang Clan, Nicki Minaj, and others.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Adams_(musician)", "type": "person",

In the filing, she claimed she connected with Diddy at a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in New York City and he subsequently invited her to his music studio.\n\nMcKinney said she left the event with Diddy to go to the studio, where some of his colleagues were present. The model claimed that the group was drinking Hennessy and passing joints around the room. McKinney smoked a portion of the joint and alleged it felt \"very powerful,\" which made her feel like she was floating. In the filing, McKinney shared that she believes the joint was laced with a narcotic or some other drug, per the outlet.\n\nAfter taking a hit, McKinney claimed that Diddy demanded she follow him into the bathroom. He allegedly forced himself on her and kissed her before putting his crotch in her face and demanded that she \"suck it.\" McKinney said she refused Diddy's advancement but she claimed the music mogul pushed her head down and forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nBreaking Down All of the Allegations Against Diddy\n\nMcKinney claimed after she walked away she started to feel lightheaded and lost consciousness. She shared that the next thing she remembered was waking up in a taxi and realizing she had been sexually assaulted. McKinney did not elaborate if she was referring to the alleged oral sex encounter or another sexual act while she was unconscious.\n\nAfter her alleged encounter with Diddy, McKinney claimed that she was blackballed from the modeling industry. She dealt with depression and contemplated suicide in 2004.\n\nMcKinney shared that she was inspired to come forward after she learned of the lawsuits filed by Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura and others. (Diddy has vehemently denied the previous allegations made against him.)\n\nUs Weekly has reached out to Diddy for comment on McKinney's claims but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\nEyebrow-Raising Quotes About Diddy's Alleged Behavior Over the Years\n\nDiddy has found himself in hot water lately. In addition to the several lawsuits against him, he recently made headlines after 2016 security footage showed him abusing Cassie, now 37, was released via CNN. After the video dropped on Friday, May 17, Diddy took to social media to apologize for his actions.\n\n\"It's difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, sometimes you gotta do that,\" Diddy said in a Sunday, May 19, Instagram video. \"I was f -- ked up. I mean, I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted.\"\n\nThe rapper continued, \"I went and sought out professional help. I've been going to therapy, going to rehab. Had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry, but I'm committed to being a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

However, Bonds expressed scepticism about the sincerity of Combs' apology, suggesting that he might only be remorseful because he was caught.\n\nThe surveillance video shows Combs grabbing Ventura by the neck, throwing her to the ground, kicking her, and taking her belongings. He then kicks her again, drags her towards a room, lets go, and throws an object at her before walking away.\n\nVentura's lawsuit described a similar incident, claiming that Combs, in a drunken state, punched her and caused a black eye. She attempted to leave but was followed by Combs, who yelled at her and threw glass vases in her direction.\n\nIHG Hotels, the former management of the InterContinental Hotel, stated that they no longer have access to prior incident records or footage.\n\nVentura's attorney, Douglas H.

Today (May 21), New York Times reported that a former model named Crystal McKinney filed a lawsuit against Diddy, accusing him of forcing her to perform oral sex on him.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, McKinney, who was 22 at the time, first met Diddy in 2003, when an unnamed fashion designer invited her to attend a Men's Fashion Week event at a restaurant in Manhattan. The suit notes that she had met Diddy that night, and was invited by him to accompany him to his recording studio. McKinney says she was given alcohol and marijuana, and later, says she came to realize it was laced.\n\nThe suit claims that Diddy led McKinney into a bathroom, pushed her head down to his crotch, and forced her to perform oral sex on him, despite her refusals. McKinney said she then lost consciousness, and woke up in a cab, realizing she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nThis is the sixth lawsuit filed against Diddy in recent time. Last November, Diddy's ex-girlfriend Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura sued him for sexual abuse, and said suit was settled within 24 hours. Shortly after,Joi Dickerson-Neal and a woman identified as Jane Doe filed two other sexual assault lawsuits against Diddy.

This comes in the wake of multiple sexual assault allegations against him, including a now-settled lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend and former signee of his label, Bad Boy Records, Casandra 'Cassie' Ventura. Despite apologizing to Cassie on video, Combs had previously denied all allegations. Here's a list of what Diddy has either departed from or been removed from since the accusations emerged.\n\nSeveral brands and businesses have started distancing themselves or severing ties with the 54-year-old American rapper. Capital Preparatory Harlem, a public charter school co-founded by Combs, ended its partnership with him in November 2023. Dr. Steve Perry, co-founder and head of schools, stated that the decision was made following a \"comprehensive evaluation and was in the best interest of the organization's health and future.\"\n\nCombs's recently launched e-commerce website, Empower Global, a marketplace for Black-owned businesses, has also been affected. As of December 10, 2023, at least 18 companies have distanced themselves from the platform. Some cited the allegations against Combs and the platform's poor performance as reasons for their departure. Annette Njau, founder of the luxury company House of Takura, stated they left Empower \"the day that Casandra Ventura filed her lawsuit,\" emphasizing their support for victims' rights.\n\nIn the entertainment sector, Hulu scrapped a reality series -- Diddy+7 (working title) -- centered on Combs and his seven children in December 2023 following the lawsuits surfaced against him.

He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.\"\n\nWell, now there's a video. And in the face of that incontrovertible evidence, Combs has finally publicly apologized.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" he said in a video statement posted to Instagram. \"I was f-ked up -- I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\"\n\nCombs added: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I am disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\n\nHere's the thing, though: Combs had the opportunity to take full responsibility last year, when Cassie filed her claim. But he took no responsibility and instead accused her of blackmail.\n\nFive other lawsuits were filed against Combs since November, with accusations ranging from sexual abuse to sex trafficking, revenge porn and gang rape. Combs and his lawyers replied to all of the allegations with denials such as \"a witch hunt\" to \"a money grab\" to \"individuals looking for a quick payday\" to \"baseless\" to \"a transparent attempt to garner headlines\" to \"complete lies.\"\n\nIn December, Combs posted to Instagram: \"Enough is enough. For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,\" he said. \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\"\n\nNow, at least part of the truth has come out, and Combs is singing a very different tune. After months not only of denial but of smearing his various accusers of being money-grubbing liars, he is admitting that at least one accuser told the truth.\n\nWhich does make one wonder: Would he have ever admitted it if there wasn't a video? If not, how sorry can he truly be? And how many abusers adopt the Combs playbook of denying responsibility, and painting accusers with legitimate accusations as greedy fabulists?\n\nThe video of a horrific assault on Cassie comes as the US faces big funding cuts for domestic violence funds, shelters, victims' services and other support systems, and as the US Supreme Court is reviewing a case that asks whether people under domestic violence restraining orders should be legally allowed to have guns. More than a third of women who were murdered in 2021 were killed by an intimate partner (for men, that number is just 6%).\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the vindication of Cassie's abuse claims may help other victims come forward. Combs' repeated and vociferous disavowals and his smearing of his accusers may serve as a crucial reminder that while not all accusations of wrongdoing are true, neither are many denials of the same.\n\nIn the American criminal law system, the accused are rightly presumed innocent until proven guilty. But in the court of public opinion a different calculus applies: As each of us, as individuals, are considering accusations of abuse or other serious wrongdoing, the word of a man shouldn't automatically outweigh that of a woman just because he's wealthier or more prominent -- or just because he's a man.\n\nBut it can't be easy for Cassie to see what must be one of the worst moments of her life broadcast worldwide. And it may take other women who have survived abuse back to a dark emotional place.\n\nNo one should have to see a video like that to believe what women say -- after all, the overwhelming majority of domestic violence incidents are not caught on camera, happening as they do at the hands of an intimate partner and often in the privacy of the home.\n\nHopefully, though, this case is an instructive one. Denials are not always true. Even powerful men with much to lose may still behave badly. And while it's good when those who hurt others take responsibility and admit wrongdoing, those admissions ring quite hollow when they only come after getting caught.\n\nResources for victims of domestic violence\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline Call 1-800-799-7233 or text LOVEIS to 22522.

There were negative stories in the industry, said Ms Barnett, but much of it stayed out of the public eye.\n\nLast November, Ms Ventura settled a lawsuit against Mr Combs - in which she accused him of rape and sexual trafficking - for an undisclosed sum. But Mr Combs' lawyer said the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing\".\n\nCelebrities continued to voice support for him, but that ended with the CCTV video obtained by CNN and published last week.\n\nThe assault shown in the footage is brutal. After kicking Ms Ventura like a football, Mr Combs, wearing just a towel, is seen dragging her across the floor.\n\nThe video appears to be a compilation of surveillance footage angles dated 5 March 2016, which CNN said was filmed at the InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. In her lawsuit, Ms Ventura had described a March 2016 incident at that hotel, in which Mr Combs allegedly attacked her.\n\nA string of other lawsuits have since been brought against Mr Combs for abuse, sexual misconduct and rape. When they were filed, the rapper called the accusations \"sickening\" and said the alleged victims were looking for \"a quick pay day\".\n\nBut the video of the assault on Ms Ventura undermined his denials.\n\nCombs was silent for two days after its release, before posting an apology to Instagram, admitting it was him in the tape and calling his actions \"inexcusable\".\n\n\"I was disgusted then when I did it,\" he said, \"and I'm disgusted now.\"\n\n\"I went and I sought out professional help,\" he continued. \"I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nCombs did not mention Cassie Ventura in his apology, and her lawyers hit back, saying: \"Combs' recent statement is more about himself than the many people he has hurt.\"\n\nThe apology was \"too little too late,\" said Camron Dowlatshahi, an entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles. \"It shows the short-sightedness of Diddy, thinking he's not going to be held accountable and that he has enough money to take care of everything.\"\n\nBarnett, who has written about misogyny in the rap industry, described the statement as \"the most ill-advised apology ever\". She suggested it was from the \"classic 'famous man' playbook: deny, deny, deny. Get caught. Apologise, then talk about going to therapy.\"\n\n\"No-one's taking it seriously, particularly because he previously accused Cassie and others of being gold-diggers. That really angered a lot of people in the music industry.\"\n\nIn April, news helicopters on both the US east and west coasts filmed police raids on mansions linked to the rapper. They were part of an ongoing criminal investigation by law enforcement into sex trafficking.\n\nThe man who was idolised as a hip-hop legend has been lying low since then.\n\nFamily pictures with his daughters posted to Mr Combs' Instagram account are in stark contrast to the images of him carrying out a violent assault.\n\nThe Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said on Friday that it would not be able to bring charges due to the statute of limitations for assault. So where does the CCTV video, and the ongoing investigation, leave his career?\n\nIn his music, Diddy has often relied on collaborations with other A-list stars. His last album featured Mary J Blige, The Weekend, 21 Savage, and John Legend. He is extremely unlikely to be able to recreate such productions now.\n\nBut whether there will be an effect on his vast number of listeners is less clear. Fitness company Peloton has banned his music from its workout playlists already, according to TMZ, but other companies are yet to comment.\n\nR Kelly continues to get millions of monthly listeners on Spotify, despite convictions for child sexual abuse.\n\nMeanwhile, Kanye West experienced a peak in his monthly listeners last year, despite being dropped by brands for expressing antisemitic views.\n\nThose who passed by Diddy's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this week reflected on what the video meant to the rapper's fans.\n\n\"It's career-ending. I don't know how he's going to come back from this,\" said Mar Anthony, a Los Angeles local. \"I was a fan when I was a kid, listening to Every Breath You Take (I'll Be Missing You). But what he did and the music, they're two different things.\n\n\"It's the same thing with Michael Jackson,\" he said, nodding towards another Walk of Fame star that lies not far away - in an apparent reference to allegations of child abuse made against that star.\n\nDiddy \"definitely deserves what is coming to him\", said Prince Laurenz Hamlin, who was visiting LA. \"But he still has built a legacy in the music industry. I think people will have to separate the art from the artist.\"\n\nOne woman, after snapping a photo of Combs' star, simply muttered \"predator\" as she walked away.\n\nIt is unclear who is currently advising Sean Combs. The law firm that previously issued denials on his behalf has said it no longer represents him.\n\nDespite the civil lawsuits there have been no criminal charges filed against him. But the ongoing police investigation will no doubt be weighing heavily on the rapper.\n\n\"The Department of Homeland Security was involved [in the raids],\" said Mr Dowlatshahi. \"Just that fact alone shows the severity of what's going on here.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weeknd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Weeknd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebony_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebony (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Century City"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "21 Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Breath_You_Take", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Every Breath You Take"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_J._Blige", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary J.

McKinney's lawsuit is the sixth major complaint in six months against the artist and mogul, and follows the release last week of video footage showing Diddy attacking then-girlfriend Casandra Elizabeth \"Cassie\" Ventura in 2016.\n\nIn the complaint, obtained by Pitchfork, McKinney describes meeting Diddy at a fashion event when she was 23. She alleges that, after being invited that night to his recording studio, she was pressured into consuming alcohol and marijuana that she later believed to be laced with a narcotic or similar substance. Once she became intoxicated, she recalls that Diddy led her to a bathroom and began kissing her against her will. He then \"shoved her head down to his crotch\" and told her to \"suck it,\" according to the lawsuit. She says that, when she refused, Diddy physically forced her.\n\nMcKinney says she passed out shortly afterward. When she woke up later in a cab, she claims, she realized she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nDiddy's legal team did not return a request for comment. The lawsuit -- filed under New York's Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act -- also names Universal Music Entertainment Group, which was not available for comment.\n\nSince Cassie filed a sexual assault lawsuit against Diddy -- which was quickly settled -- last November, a string of accusers has stepped forward. The same month, two women separately sued the musician, one alleging rape, the other sex trafficking and revenge porn, both in the 1990s. In December, another lawsuit alleged he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old high school student in 2003.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN. This article has been updated to reflect the latest news.\n\nCNN --\n\nLast year, singer Cassie Ventura (who goes by \"Cassie\") settled a lawsuit with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs after she accused him of years of physical abuse, including rape and being forced into sex with male sex workers.\n\nJill Filipovic. Courtesy Jill Filipovic\n\nAfter the settlement, his lawyers were clear that Combs was innocent. \"A decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing,\" Ben Brafman, an attorney for Combs, told CNN in a statement in November. \"Mr. Combs' decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.\"\n\nWell, now there's a video. And in the face of that incontrovertible evidence, Combs has finally publicly apologized.\n\n\"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" he said in a video statement posted to Instagram. \"I was f-ked up -- I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\"\n\nCombs added: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I am disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\n\nHere's the thing, though: Combs had the opportunity to take full responsibility last year, when Cassie filed her claim. But he took no responsibility and instead accused her of blackmail.\n\nFive other lawsuits were filed against Combs since November, with accusations ranging from sexual abuse to sex trafficking, revenge porn and gang rape. Combs and his lawyers replied to all of the allegations with denials such as \"a witch hunt\" to \"a money grab\" to \"individuals looking for a quick payday\" to \"baseless\" to \"a transparent attempt to garner headlines\" to \"complete lies.\"\n\nIn December, Combs posted to Instagram: \"Enough is enough. For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy,\" he said. \"Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.\"\n\nNow, at least part of the truth has come out, and Combs is singing a very different tune. After months not only of denial but of smearing his various accusers of being money-grubbing liars, he is admitting that at least one accuser told the truth.\n\nWhich does make one wonder: Would he have ever admitted it if there wasn't a video? If not, how sorry can he truly be? And how many abusers adopt the Combs playbook of denying responsibility, and painting accusers with legitimate accusations as greedy fabulists?\n\nThe video of a horrific assault on Cassie comes as the US faces big funding cuts for domestic violence funds, shelters, victims' services and other support systems, and as the US Supreme Court is reviewing a case that asks whether people under domestic violence restraining orders should be legally allowed to have guns. More than a third of women who were murdered in 2021 were killed by an intimate partner (for men, that number is just 6%).\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the vindication of Cassie's abuse claims may help other victims come forward. Combs' repeated and vociferous disavowals and his smearing of his accusers may serve as a crucial reminder that while not all accusations of wrongdoing are true, neither are many denials of the same.\n\nIn the American criminal law system, the accused are rightly presumed innocent until proven guilty. But in the court of public opinion a different calculus applies: As each of us, as individuals, are considering accusations of abuse or other serious wrongdoing, the word of a man shouldn't automatically outweigh that of a woman just because he's wealthier or more prominent -- or just because he's a man.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut it can't be easy for Cassie to see what must be one of the worst moments of her life broadcast worldwide. And it may take other women who have survived abuse back to a dark emotional place.\n\nNo one should have to see a video like that to believe what women say -- after all, the overwhelming majority of domestic violence incidents are not caught on camera, happening as they do at the hands of an intimate partner and often in the privacy of the home.\n\nHopefully, though, this case is an instructive one. Denials are not always true. Even powerful men with much to lose may still behave badly. And while it's good when those who hurt others take responsibility and admit wrongdoing, those admissions ring quite hollow when they only come after getting caught.\n\nResources for victims of domestic violence\n\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline Call 1-800-799-7233 or text LOVEIS to 22522.

I'm gonna need more episodes.\" [sic]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Netflix to confirm the series, as well as reps for 50 Cent.\n\nTMZ was first to report that the docuseries will look into allegations leveled against Diddy, many of which stem from producer Ronnie \"Lil Rod\" Jones' explosive lawsuit accusing Diddy in November of sexual abuse, rape and sex trafficking. TMZ indicated that the multi-part docuseries will hit the streamer soon.\n\nThe Lil Rod legal filing came just weeks after Diddy settled one case for an undisclosed sum with his ex-partner, the recording artist Cassie. The two parties settled just one day after she filed her lawsuit accusing Combs of rape and ongoing physical abuse -- the latter of which was on clear display in a harrowing video from 2016 that CNN acquired and released Friday; in it, Combs attacks Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway, kicking and shoving her, and dragging her by her sweatshirt, before throwing an object at her. The Los Angeles District Attorney's office said in a statement that they were aware of the video but unable to charge dude to the statute of limitations for a crime of assault.\n\nIn a subsequent apology video, Diddy referred to that time period as \"the darkest times\" in his life. \"I was fucked up -- I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses,\" he said. \"My behavior on that video is inexcusable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, as news of Netflix's apparent latest acquisition spread, Combs was hit with a fresh sexual assault suit. According to the complaint, filed in New York and obtained by and reported on by NBC News, this case comes from an ex-model claiming Combs drugged and sexually assaulted her during Fashion Week in 2003 after meeting him at Cipriani downtown. Crystal McKinney claims in the suit that she was drugged with a laced blunt, at which point Combs forced oral sex on her after she refused his advances.\n\nSimilar scenarios are detailed in Lil Rod's suit, which was filed in November.\n\nJackson had teased the docuseries project on X (formerly Twitter) after the complaint was filed seven months ago, tweeting a video wherein Mark Curry, then a rapper signed to Diddy-led Bad Boy Records, discusses partying with Combs as he would spike bottles of champagne with \"something to make the girls real, real slippery.\" Background music in Jackson's clip -- Rick Ross' \"U.O.E.N.O.\" -- features unsubtle lyrics about surreptitiously drugging champagne meant for women in nightclubs.\n\nJones' suit also alleges that Diddy had employed Jackson's ex and mother of his child, Daphne Joy, as a sex worker (though no evidence of this is provided in Jones' filing; Joy has denied the claims). As a result, Jackson is currently suing Joy (real name Daphne Joy Narvaez) for defamation following her public accusation in March that he raped her while the two were in a relationship more than a decade ago. (Jackson has denied the claim.)\n\nJackson and Combs' beef goes back to 2006 when 50 Cent was relatively fresh on the rap scene and Diddy was nearly a decade into his music career. On his track \"The Bomb,\" Jackson indicated that Combs knew the identity of Notorious B.I.G.'s killer; Combs was present with the late rapper when he was gunned down in a drive-by shooting in 1997 after a brief but brilliant career. Jackson has accused Combs of profiting off of B.I.G.'s death through his music and has suggested the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer was involved in the death of B.I.G.'s rival Tupac Shakur, who was shot dead in Las Vegas in 1996.\n\nOver the years, Jackson has beefed with Combs, questioning his sexuality and, in 2015, over their competing vodka brands. The ongoing feud ramped up when Lil Rod's lawsuit was filed.\n\nCombs has also denied all of the claims made against him in Lil Rod's suit and four of the lawsuits alleging sexual assault and misconduct, some of which were filed under the New York Adult Survivors Act's one-year window for adult victims to file a suits against alleged abusers.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com",

There were negative stories in the industry, said Ms Barnett, but much of it stayed out of the public eye.\n\nLast November, Ms Ventura settled a lawsuit against Mr Combs - in which she accused him of rape and sexual trafficking - for an undisclosed sum. But Mr Combs' lawyer said the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing\".\n\nCelebrities continued to voice support for him afterwards - but that his position unravelled with the CCTV video obtained by CNN and published last week.\n\nThe assault shown in the footage is brutal. After kicking Ms Ventura like a football, Mr Combs, wearing just a towel, is seen dragging her across the floor.\n\nThe video appears to be a compilation of surveillance footage angles dated 5 March 2016, which CNN said was filmed at the InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles. In her lawsuit, Ms Ventura had described a March 2016 incident at that hotel, in which Mr Combs allegedly attacked her.\n\nA string of lawsuits have since been brought against Mr Combs for abuse, sexual misconduct and rape. When they were filed, the rapper called the accusations \"sickening\" and said the alleged victims were looking for \"a quick pay day\".\n\nBut the video of the assault on Ms Ventura undermined his denials.\n\nCombs was silent for two days after its release, before posting an apology to Instagram, admitting it was him in the tape and calling his actions \"inexcusable\".\n\n\"I was disgusted then when I did it,\" he said, \"and I'm disgusted now.\"\n\n\"I went and I sought out professional help,\" he continued. \"I got into going to therapy, going to rehab.

McKinney is seeking unspecified damages and claims she was drugged and sexually assaulted by Diddy during a party in 2003. She was 22 at the time, and claims that Diddy invited her back to his studio after connecting with him at a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in New York City.\n\nOnce at Diddy's studio, McKinney claims multiple people were there and that they were all passing around a joint. She was offered a hit and took it, describing it as \"very powerful.\" She said she felt like she was floating, and Diddy asked to accompany her to the bathroom. She says Puff began kissing her and shoved her head down to his crotch before demanding she \"suck it.\" When she refused, he allegedly forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nShe said she tried to leave and felt woozy and lost consciousness. McKinney says the next thing she remembered was waking up in a taxi, and realizing she'd been sexually assaulted. TMZ claims it's unclear from the lawsuit if McKinney is referring to the alleged forced oral sex, or another sex act that might have occurred while she was unconscious.\n\nMcKinney said the experience led to a suicide attempt in 2004, and that she was blackballed from the modeling industry.\n\nXXL has reached out to Diddy's team for further comment.\n\nThis is just the latest legal snafu for Diddy. Just a few days ago, Puff issued an apology for a video that emerged showing him brutally beating his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel hallway back in 2016.\n\nIt's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life, but sometimes you got to do that,\" Diddy began in his video on Sunday (May 19), which can be viewed below.\n\n\"I was f**ked up -- I hit rock bottom -- but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he continued. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab.

Your time is coming.'\n\nBeckinsale did not share the name of who she was directing her warning to, or share further details about what the post concerned.\n\nHer story comes hours after Combs was hit with another abuse lawsuit - stemming from an alleged incident in New York in 2003.\n\nFormer model Crystal McKinney alleged that he forced her to perform a sex act on him after allegedly promising her a career boost.\n\nIn her filing, obtained by multiple outlets, she claimed that they met at a 2003 Men's Fashion Week event, where he invited her back to his music studio.\n\nMcKinney, aged 22 at the time, said the businessman and several of his entourage were drinking and smoking cannabis at the studio - she smoked with them and described the weed as 'very powerful'.\n\nSky News reports that she 'later came to understand' that the joint may have been laced with another drug.\n\nCombs then allegedly demanded for McKinney to follow him into the bathroom, where he forced himself on her, kissing her and shoving her head to his crotch - before ordering her to perform a sex act.\n\nAccording to the documents, he pushed her head down again when she refused, and forced her into the act.\n\nMcKinney - who is seeking undisclosed damages - alleged that she later lost consciousness and woke up in a taxi, where she realized she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nShe claimed that she was then blacklisted from the modeling industry, and attempted suicide in 2004, amid fears she 'sabotaged her own career'.\n\nCombs has yet to respond to the latest allegations.\n\nOver the weekend, he issued a groveling apology to Ventura after footage of his 2016 attack against her was made public last week - months after she filed a lawsuit.\n\n'I was f***ed up. I mean, I hit rock bottom. But I make no excuses. My behavior in that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,' he said.\n\n'I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, I'm disgusted now.\n\n'I went and I sought professional help, started going to therapy, I've been going to rehab.

A litany of similar accusations from other women ensued.\n\nBonds claimed Combs was violent toward women at least \"four or five times\" during his tenure and told Morgan the \"king manipulator\" frequently got into \"wrestling and punching matches\" with women. He added: \"I've seen him with ... Kim [Porter], his kids' mother.\"\n\n\"I've seen him inside the car, grab her up,\" Bonds told Morgan. \"I've seen him smack her, and one thing about Kim is Kim got to the point where she fought back because she realized how powerful she was.\"\n\nPorter had three children with Combs and died suddenly of apparent pneumonia in 2018.\n\nBonds told Morgan he wasn't surprised by footage of Combs assaulting Ventura because he'd \"seen things to this nature before\" and \"gotten in-between things\" as early as 2012. He recalled thinking that Combs was simply \"up to the same games\" yet again.\n\nVentura alleged in her 2023 lawsuit, which was settled for an undisclosed amount one day after filing, that Bonds witnessed Combs stomping her in 2009 after he learned she'd spoken to a music manager at a club in Los Angeles -- and that Bonds tried to stop Combs.\n\nCombs issued an apology Sunday that made no direct mention of Ventura or the harm she suffered. Meredith Firetog, a partner at the Wigdor LLP legal firm who represented her in the suit, described the apology to Deadline as \"pathetic\" and \"disingenuous.\"\n\nBonds said Monday that Combs only \"said what he thought people wanted to hear\" and is merely sorry because he got caught. Combs is currently facing five other civil lawsuits that regard accusations of sexual misconduct, coercion and other illegal activities.\n\n\"It's a deeper anger when you're hitting and punching a woman in that type of manner,\" Bonds told Morgan. \"When you have a problem with every woman that you're dealing with, then I think that problem is inside of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan_Uncensored", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan Uncensored"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century City"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Male prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/dc77aabe02028e3da00b7840942e866f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

If you believe you have experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct and are looking for support, consult the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime to find resources in your area.\n\nFormer model Crystal McKinney is suing the music mogul for allegedly forcing her to perform oral sex on him at his studio in 2003, according to the complaint obtained by Pitchfork. McKinney claims to have met Diddy at a fashion event when she was 23 and to have accepted an invitation to go to his recording studio that night.\n\nThere, she says she was pressured into consuming alcohol and marijuana, which she later believed to have been laced with some narcotic substance. Once intoxicated, McKinney remembers Diddy leading her into the bathroom and kissing her against her will. As per the lawsuit, he proceeded to \"shove her head down his crotch\" and told her to \"suck it\" -- and when she refused, she claims Diddy physically forced her.\n\nMcKinney passed out shortly thereafter and recalls waking up in a cab, realizing she had been sexually assaulted.

Many want to see Diddy face legal repercussions for what he did to Cassie, but the LAPD clarified that they cannot make an arrest due to how long ago the incident took place. This, however, has not stopped other women from coming with other allegations against Diddy.\n\nOn May 21, Crystal McKinney filed a lawsuit in which she claimed to have been drugged and sexually assaulted by the Bad Boy founder. The model claimed that she encountered Diddy at a Men's Fashion Week event in 2003, and was invited back to his studio for an afterparty. While there, Diddy gave her drinks and various items to smoke. McKinney recalls taking a hit from a joint she described as \"very powerful,\" and believes that it was laced with various narcotics.\n\nRead More: Eric Adams Is Looking Into Revoking Diddy's Key To NYC Following Cassie Assault Video\n\nDiddy took her to a bathroom and allegedly tried to force himself on McKinney. The model claimed that he shoved her head down into his crotch. He then ordered her, allegedly, to \"suck it.\" McKinney states in the lawsuit that she lost consciousness shortly after the incident. She woke up the next day in a taxi cab. Per TMZ, it hasn't been made clear whether McKinney's assault allegations stemmed from the bathroom encounter or another unspecified incident involving Diddy.\n\nMcKinney claimed that she was subsequently blacklisted in the modeling industry. She struggled to find work after her encounter with Diddy and noted that she attempted suicide in 2004. The former model is seeking unspecified damages as a result. McKinney's allegations fall in line with previous suits brought against Diddy. In November 2023, two women sued the mogul for assault, beatings and forced drugging in the 1990s.

On November 16, 2023 singer Cassie, real name Casandra Ventura, sued her former partner and record label boss, Sean 'Diddy' Combs, alleging over 13 years' worth of abuse, including sex trafficking and sexual assault. The levels of coercion, control, humiliation and violence endured by the singer since meeting Combs at the age of 19 in 2005 is utterly shocking. 'After years in silence and darkness I am finally ready to tell my story,' Cassie said, in a statement given to the New York Times, 'and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships'.\n\nDespite initially denying the accusations, billionaire Combs - who also goes by the name of 'Love' - agreed to a settlement a day later on November 17. 'We have decided to resolve this matter amicably,' Diddy said in a statement the following day. 'I wish Cassie and her family all the best. Love.' In the six months since, he has been served six further sexual assault lawsuits, the latest of which was filed on May 21, days after surveillance footage obtained by CNN showed an incident which appeared to corroborate parts of Ms Ventura's original complaint against Combs. The video from March 2016 showed Combs chasing her down the corridor of a Los Angeles hotel and proceeding to punch and kick her outside a set of elevators. Taking to Instagram on May 19, two days after the video's release, Combs admitted that it was him in the CCTV footage and took 'full responsibility' for beating Ventura, calling his actions 'inexcusable.'\n\nClaims like Cassie's against powerful men in the music business are nothing new. There's the alleged grooming of a 14-year-old Priscilla by Elvis Presley in 1959 and the Rolling Stone bassist Bill Wyman courting 13-year-old Mandi Smith in 1984. He was 47. 'She took my breath away... she was a woman at thirteen,' he wrote in his 1997 autobiography, Stone Alone. More recently, there's been R Kelly - say no more. While Aerosmith's Stephen Tyler is facing questions over historic sexual assault allegations (Tyler has issued a denial over all accusations). In a case of a rare guilty verdict, British MC Solo 45 (real name Andy Anokye) was convicted and sentenced in 2020 to 24 years for waterboarding, interrogating and raping four women. His sentence was increased to 30 years in 2021 after the Court of Appeal ruled that his initial sentence was 'unduly lenient'.\n\nFIND OUT MORE ON ELLE COLLECTIVE\n\nThe music industry is, in fact, so entrenched in sexism, inappropriate behaviour and serious assault that earlier this year a Misogyny in Music inquiry was set up in Parliament by the Women and Equalities Committee. Former Radio 1 DJ Annie Macmanus and X Factor alumni Rebecca Ferguson are among those who have given evidence.\n\n'[Misogyny] is the tip of the iceberg of the things that are happening behind the scenes. If you read the unredacted version of my written evidence, you will see how sinister music has become. What is scary is that it will only get worse if the Government doesn't act,' Ferguson told the committee, highlighting exploitation, assault, bullying, corruption, and human rights abuses as part of her evidence. 'It's infuriating the amount of women who just have stories of sexual assault, they just had to bury them and carry them, it's just unbelievable,' Macmanus told the inquiry. 'So I do think if something were to happen, if one person were to speak that had enough profile where it got media attention, there could be a kind of tidal wave of it. Definitely.'\n\nAnd here Macmanus gets to the heart of the problem. In the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, more women have coming forward. But history has proved that for women who do speak up, it's an incredibly slow, painful and often re-traumatising task; I empathise with why so many are reluctant to do so.\n\nIt's not just the victims. Those in the industry witness and are party to - or aware of - behaviour that is not only immoral but illegal. Yet so few people report it. Partly from fear of losing a job or other retaliations, but also possibly because there are so few systems in place within the music and creative industries to report such behaviours. During my time as a music journalist, I've heard about countless 'handsy' (at best) editors, artists and executives. Yet I've only had a HR department in three of my eight staff jobs. Even if I had information, I had nowhere to take it. If you do attempt to report - does anything happen? Lily Allen was willing to discuss her own experiences of assault by a record industry exec, yet, as far as we know, her alleged perpetrator is still at large. Why isn't more being done?\n\nReactions to Cassie's allegations were initially relatively muted within the music industry. The singer Ke$ha changed the lyrics to her 2009 single 'TikTok' while performing in California two days after the suit was settled. 'Wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy', became 'Wake up in the morning feeling just like me'. Other artists previously signed to Combs's Bad Boy Records also spoke out in support of Ventura, including Danity Kane's Aubrey O'Day, who echoed Macmanus' statement. 'It isn't easy to take on one of the most powerful people in this industry,' she said. 'May her voice bring all the others to the table, so we can start having more transparent conversations about what is actually happening behind the scenes.' 50 Cent predicted more women will talk and is apparently developing a documentary about Combs and there was a cryptic comment on Instagram Stories from Kimora Lee Simmons, who in a 2004 interview with New York magazine accused Diddy of threatening to punch her in the stomach while pregnant.\n\nThe world of business reacted more decisively, with brands Combs worked alongside, such as Diageo and Pound Cake, almost immediately severing ties. A New York school that he had pledged $1 million (\u00a3787,000) to has also ended its partnership with him. In November, after settling with Ventura, Combs himself stepped down as chairman of Revolt, the cable TV network he co-founded in 2013 -- albeit temporarily. But, despite reaching a settlement, Combs's attorney Ben Brafman told the Independent that this is not an admission of guilt. 'Just so we're clear, a decision to settle a lawsuit, especially in 2023, is in no way an admission of wrongdoing. Mr. Combs' decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best.'\n\nAnd so it goes, another rich, famous, powerful man settles a lawsuit and the subject is muted.\n\nIn 2018, the Washington Post wrote a lengthy article about how people in power were wilfully blind to Kelly's behaviour. Barry Weiss, the chief executive of Kelly's record label, Jive, from 1991 to 2011, told the Post he never talked to Kelly about his behaviour because it didn't concern him. 'I was a record company putting out R. Kelly's records,' said Weiss. 'That was all I knew. I wasn't involved in his criminal cases. We were a record company, for God's sakes.' The founder of Jive, Clive Calder, was a little more contrite. 'But I'm not a psychiatrist, and this guy is a troubled guy. Clearly, we missed something.'\n\nThe second crucial issue here, raised in kind by Ferguson, is the problem with prosecuting sex crimes. It is incredibly hard to get a rape case to court - let alone win it. According to Rape Crisis, 68,109 rapes were recorded by police in England and Wales between July 2022 and June 2023. Charges were brought in just 2.2% (1,498) of cases. That means only two out of 100 rapes resulted in someone being charged - let alone convicted. And those able to get a case to court can expect to wait over two years for it to complete.\n\nSo Cassie's options: in a civil court, a conviction is reached on a balance of probability. The accuser needs to prove that it is 51% likely that the defendant is guilty. But if Cassie takes it to criminal court, she must prove beyond reasonable doubt that she's telling the truth. And that could take years. There's a much higher threshold of truth in a criminal court and it is therefore much, much harder for victims of rape and sexual assault to obtain a positive verdict. Most rape and assaults take place in private with little evidence, making it difficult to prove - it becomes your word against theirs. There are other factors too: a lack of police resources, the time it takes to get to court, and a lack of support for victims themselves. Such low rates of conviction are hardly an incentive for men to stop committing these crimes - regardless of their job, role or position in society.\n\nCassie was able to avoid a long, humiliating and potentially unsuccessful court case, receive compensation of sorts and let people know her truth about a man she claims has been allowed to commit crimes for decades without reproach.\n\nHowever, the naming and shaming of Combs lawsuits feels unlikely to change much. Even the film industry's initially galvanising #MeToo moment seems to have stalled, especially given that Harvey Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction was overturned in New York in April 2024. There have been so few other convictions, with cases being settled or no charges being brought against the accused. All the while, rape cases rise.\n\nAgain from Rape Crisis, the most recent report published by the Office of National Statistics shows rape offences have increased dramatically in England and Wales since 2012/13. 1 in 4 women are raped or sexually assaulted as an adult and the overall statistics in England and Wales found that 85,000 women experience rape, attempted rape or sexual assault every year.\n\nIt's not only the music industry that has a problem - it's human beings. Yes, men are also subject to rape but it is overwhelmingly women and trans people who are victims and it is overwhelmingly men committing these crimes. Women need to feel safe reporting crimes to the police - one police officer per week is currently accused of rape, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and Channel 5. Until we're able to support victims - and believe them -- until the criminal justice system can find a fairer way to convict rape and sexual offences, the music industry and the world at large has a huge problem. And no amount of hashtags can help that.\n\nThose affected by rape or sexual abuse can contact Rape Crisis on 0808 802 9999 (England and Wales) or on 08088 01 03 02 (Scotland).\n\nELLE Collective is a new community of fashion, beauty and culture lovers.

Months of speculation and social media buzz have finally resulted in the revelation that Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson's production company, G-Unit Film & Television, will spearhead this riveting expos\u00e9, set to unravel the intricate web of accusations against Combs.\n\nThe genesis of this project traces back to December when Jackson first hinted at the possibility of shedding light on the dark shadows clouding Combs' legacy.\n\nVisit streaming.thesource.com for more information\n\nFueling the anticipation, faux posters teasing a documentary began circulating on social media, igniting fervent discussions among netizens. Amidst the buzz, Jackson confirmed in a tweet that Netflix had emerged victorious in the heated \"bidding war,\" securing the rights to the series. However, with a poignant caveat, Jackson acknowledged that should more victims come forward, the narrative might necessitate additional episodes -- a testament to the gravity of the allegations at hand.\n\nCentral to the documentary's focus are the distressing accounts of sexual abuse, rape, and sex trafficking leveled against Combs by multiple women over the past six months.\n\nCombs, vehemently denying these claims, finds himself ensnared in a storm of accusations, with the latest lawsuit surfacing on the very day of Netflix's announcement. The documentary promises an unflinching examination of these allegations, juxtaposed against Combs' staunch denials.\n\nTestimonies of individuals once entrenched within Combs' inner circle, including former rapper Mark Curry, who divulged unsettling anecdotes from their time under Combs' tutelage. Notably, lyrics from a Rick Ross song, eerily echoing themes of drugging and sexual assault, underscore the chilling allegations permeating the documentary's discourse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA pivotal moment occurred with the release of surveillance footage depicting Combs' altercation with his former girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura -- a visual testament to the dynamics overshadowing their relationship. Combs' subsequent apology video signifies a recognition of past transgressions, yet leaves lingering questions regarding accountability. Netflix's decision to greenlight this docuseries reflects a commitment to amplifying voices long silenced by power dynamics within the industry.\n\nThoughts?", "source": {"uri": "thesource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Unit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "G-Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Production company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Curry_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Curry (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_R&B", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary R&B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screen-Shot-2024-05-22-at-11.07.47-AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

However, he deleted the post in a few hours.\n\n\"Got damn boy another one (eyes emoji),\" 50 Cent wrote in the caption of the since-deleted post. \"This my last puffy post I think he might kill himself. I don't want no parts of that,\" he added.\n\nSean is in fresh trouble as the music mogul has been hit by another lawsuit, which was filed in New York. This time, a former model is claiming that he drugged her and then forced her to perform oral sex on him during a visit to his studio in New York two decades ago. (Also read: Sean 'Diddy' Combs' ex-assistant not surprised at Cassie Ventura video as 'intuition' told her rapper is violent)\n\nAccording to People magazine, in the complaint, Crystal McKinney has alleged that she was 22 years old when she was introduced to the mogul, now 54, by a fashion designer while working as a model back in 2003. They met at a restaurant in Manhattan.\n\nLater that night, according to the lawsuit, Sean invited her to his recording studio, where Crystal claims she was given alcohol and marijuana which she now believes was laced.\n\nShe said that Sean then led her to the bathroom, shoved her head down to his crotch, following which she was forced to perform oral sex on him. The lawsuit further stated that she then lost consciousness, and gained consciousness in a cab where she realised that she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nIn the complaint, Crystal also alleged that she was instructed to sit \"directly across from Sean\" at the event, adding that he \"made a very public display of coming on to (her) in a sexually suggestive manner which continued throughout the dinner\" at the event.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Crystal described Sean as \"flirtatious\" during the course of their meeting, saying that he had a lot of alcohol throughout the dinner, and refilled her glass with wine.\n\nShe also claimed that Sean \"blackballed\" her career. \"Due to the traumatic events to occur later, Plaintiff (Crystal) saved the unwashed clothing from that night in her closet where they remain in a plastic wrap,\" stated the lawsuit.\n\nThe amount she is seeking in damages is not known. At the moment, Sean is yet to react to the fresh lawsuit.\n\nThis is the sixth lawsuit against the rapper since he was accused of rape and abuse by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, known as Cassie, in November last year. The lawsuit was settled in one day. Three more suits followed from women who accused him of rape. In March, two of Sean's homes were raided as part of an investigation.\n\nThe music mogul has called the allegations against him false and \"sickening,\" describing the accusers as looking for \"a quick payday.\"\n\nTo add to the trouble, Sean's conduct has come under intense scrutiny in recent days after CNN published footage from 2016 in which he is seen hitting his former girlfriend Casandra.\n\nOn Sunday, he apologised, saying in a video posted to Instagram, \"My behaviour on that video is inexcusable\".", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Combs", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Combs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_da_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "In da Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassie_Ventura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassie Ventura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recording studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/22/1600x900/Sean_Diddy_50_cents_1716368900367_1716368912637.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588107", "eventUri": "eng-9588107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

She met the Bad Boy founder at the event, and was invited back to his studio, where they consumed alcoholic beverages and smoked joints. McKinney called the joint \"very powerful\" as she felt like she was \"floating\" after taking a hit. She believes that it was laced with a narcotic.\n\nMcKinney claims that the \"I Need A Girl\" artist urged her to follow him to the bathroom, and it was there that he began to force himself on her with kisses. At one point, he attempted to push her head down to his crotch area and told her to \"Suck it.\" She refused, but the former Making The Band star continued his efforts and forced oral sex, she claims.\n\nShe attempted to walk away only to begin feeling woozy, and eventually lost consciousness. She later woke up in a taxi and came to terms with the fact that she was sexually assaulted. McKinney claims that she attempted to continue her modeling career, but was blackballed from the industry, which led to her feeling depressed and attempting suicide in 2004.\n\nDespite over 20 years passing since this incident, McKinney claims that she \"knew she had a moral obligation to speak up\" after seeing Cassie and other women file lawsuits against Diddy. She is seeking damages via litigation, though the number was not specified in the court documents.\n\nThis latest lawsuit against the former REVOLT chairman comes after CNN shared footage of him assaulting Cassie in a now-closed Los Angeles hotel in 2016. Puff can be seen grabbing his former partner by the neck as she attempted to get on an elevator and throwing her to the ground. He kicked her twice, gathered her belongings, and tried to drag her back to their room, all while holding up a towel wrapped around his waist. Later in the video, he can be seen throwing objects at the \"Long Way 2 Go\" singer.\n\nDiddy shared an apology video days after the footage surfaced. \"It's so difficult to reflect on the darkest times in your life,\" he said. \"Sometimes you gotta do that. I was f**ked up. I mean, I hit rock bottom but I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted.

It's the latest in a series of allegations against the embattled hip-hop mogul. Crystal McKinney said she was a successful 22-year-old model when she met Combs at a restaurant during Men's Fashion Week in Manhattan. Combs invited her to his recording studio later that night, according to the federal complaint filed in New York City. The lawsuit alleges that McKinney arrived to find Combs drinking and smoking joints with several other men. The suit says she smoked some marijuana, which she \"later came to understand\" was laced with a narcotic or intoxicating substance. The lawsuit was filed days after CNN aired security video that shows Combs attacking singer Cassie in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Combs on Sunday released a video admitting he attacked Cassie in the hotel hallway, saying he was \"truly sorry\" and his actions were \"inexcusable.\"\n\nMore details emerge about company trying to auction Graceland\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - A notary whose name is listed on documents that purportedly show Lisa Marie Presley putting up Graceland as collateral for a loan says she never met Presley or notarized any documents for her. Presley's daughter, actor Riley Keough (KEE'-oh), is suing a company called Naussany (NAW'-sah-nee) Investments and Private Lending that had planned to auction Graceland tomorrow. The company said Presley owed $3.8 million on a 2018 loan. Keough inherited the estate after Presley died last year. Representatives for Naussany directed questions to their attorneys, but none are listed in court records. An injunction hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.\n\nSerj Tankian explains the thinking behind \"Chop Suey!\"\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Serj Tankian (TAHN'-kee-an) of System Of A Down jokes the reason they called their song \"Chop Suey!\" instead of \"Suicide\" is because it doesn't take a linguistic or marketing expert to tell you that \"Suicide\" is not a great name for a song. So why did they call it that? Tankian says part of it is because the song is choppy: it starts and stops a lot. He says another part is because he would regularly insert food lyrics into songs to make the band laugh. Tankian has an autobiography out now called \"Down With The System.\"\n\nWillie Nelson writes cannabis cookbook\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - If you had to guess the secret ingredient in Willie Nelson's cooking, what would that be?

It also will have a chapter on making cannabis-based ingredients like simple syrups and tinctures. The cookbook will be out Nov. 12.\n\nMartina McBride will be a judge on competition show\n\nMartina McBride will be a judge on a new talent competition aimed at people who put aside their dreams of being on stage because life got in the way. \"Second Chance Stage\" will feature performers who sing, dance and do stand-up comedy as they compete for the chance to win a $100,000 prize. The audience will be full of talent scouts, agents and producers. Actor Taye Diggs and comedian Heidi Gardner also will be judges. Sports broadcaster Emmanuel Acho will host. \"Second Chance Stage\" will air on Magnolia Network this fall.\n\nAni DiFranco leaves \"Hadestown\" as Yola joins\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Yola will take over for Ani DiFranco in the role of Persephone in the Broadway production of \"Hadestown.\" DiFranco will play the role until June 30.

Former Model Claims Mogul Drugged Her Before Horrifying SA In Bathroom", "body": "[Warning: Potentially Triggering Content]\n\nDiddy has been sued for sexual assault again.\n\nAccording to TMZ on Tuesday, a former model named Crystal McKinney filed a lawsuit against the music mogul for an alleged assault she claimed happened in 2003 -- when she was 22. In the suit, she recalled meeting Diddy during a Men's Fashion Week event at Cipriani Downtown in New York City. The rapper invited her back to his studio, where he and several colleagues drank Hennessy and passed around joints. Crystal took a hit, which was \"very powerful,\" to the point where it felt like she was floating. In the filing, she claimed the joint was laced with a narcotic or some other drug.\n\nRelated: Diddy's Ex Misa Hylton Says She Knows 'Exactly' How Cassie Feels After Seeing Hotel Video\n\nCrystal claims Diddy then demanded she follow him into the bathroom. And what allegedly happened next is horrifying. She says the Bad Boy Records founder forced himself on her and kissed her before pushing her head down to his crotch, commanding her to \"suck it.\" Crystal said she refused. However, Diddy allegedly did not stop. She claimed he then pushed her head down again and forced oral sex.\n\nWhen Crystal tried walking away, she felt woozy and suddenly passed out. She later regained consciousness in a taxi and realized she had been sexually assaulted. Crystal doesn't elaborate on whether she's referring to the alleged forced oral sex or another sexual act that might have happened while unconscious.\n\nAfter the alleged incident, Crystal claimed she was blackballed from the modeling industry. She also suffered from severe depression afterward and attempted suicide in 2004. Incredibly heartbreaking. The model shared in the filing she was inspired to come forward with her story after seeing news of the lawsuits by Cassie Ventura and others, saying she \"knew she had a moral obligation to speak up\" now. Crystal is seeking unspecified damages.\n\nDiddy has been in hot water since November 2023, when Cassie sued him for physically abusing, raping, and trafficking her throughout their decade-long relationship. Others have come forward to sue him for similar allegations of assault and sex trafficking. The Department of Homeland Security then raided his homes in Beverly Hills and Miami in connection to a sex trafficking investigation. He vehemently denied all the accusations. But recently, he made more headlines after security footage from 2016 showed him brutally abusing Cassie at a hotel. After the video dropped, Diddy apologized for his actions in a video posted on social media -- without mentioning her name.\n\nDiddy has not addressed the new allegations against him.

The artist/mogul's legal future is still up in the air, with various lawsuits still pending against him.\n\nBut it seems like his public reputation is finished.\n\nThis isn't always the case with Black celebrities. There are plenty of examples of celebrities who have been able to maintain their success. Chris Brown may have a certain ceiling, but he's continued to satisfy a loyal fan base despite assaulting Rihanna and having other, less visible cases that followed.\n\nBasketball star Derrick Rose escaped a rape case in 2015 and had fans lauding him three years later when he had a 50-point game. Dr. Dre allegedly violently assaulted women in the 1990s, and he's weathered the storm enough to even have a new Grammy Award named after him.\n\nMany who have been found guilty of crimes such as sexual assault or domestic violence -- whether legally or in the public eye -- have been able to redeem themselves through a combination of silence, contrition, and continued quality of whatever product made fans fall in love with them in the first place. It's all about the veneer of honesty and repentance, followed by art that's so powerful that people can't deprive themselves of it. Or, if there's no proof of the crimes being committed, simply staying out of the public eye before returning with some of their best work.\n\nBut Combs' journey toward public forgiveness is uniquely difficult for two reasons: because of damning video footage and because that footage surfaced after he had already begun the sort of rebranding campaign that allows so many to build themselves back up: In recent years he had taken on several strategic steps toward helping his image: adopting the moniker \"Love,\" releasing an R&B album loaded with guest appearances by other stars and returning masters ownership to artists who were previously signed to his label Bad Boy. There was still skepticism, but they were still steps in the right direction.\n\nShortly after Cassie and three others issued explosive lawsuits accusing him of crimes such as rape, sex trafficking, sexual misconduct with minors and more, he released a statement that denied all wrongdoing, with no concessions.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" he wrote in a December post. \"I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and legacy... Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged.\"\n\nBy spring 2024, Combs had already begun to lose all that he'd worked for, with his many corporate partners cutting ties. But he still may have had a chance at redemption. Some supporters may have chosen not to believe the allegations at all, adopting one or more of many methods of plausible deniability. They may have claimed that these were simply people going after a payday, that they \"knew what they were getting into\" by dealing with him, or that this was another example of powers that be corralling in an attempt to take down a Black man who had made it.\n\nEven if people hadn't believed his denials, they could have convinced themselves that he had changed. Had he stayed out of the public eye and continued his safe, sporadic posts about his family, there would have still been a substantial amount of people who refused to support him, but there also could have been people who came back around.\n\nBut the footage from the hotel changed things, because it put his duplicity in such clear and undeniable terms. The video directly corroborated one of the stories that Ventura said in her filing...stories that Combs had denied. Had this video been released upon the time of the lawsuits, he could have apologized, retreated, and returned after extended time away.\n\nBut a dismal attempt at accountability after he's already so clearly lied won't be enough. It'll be difficult to forget such damning footage of him assaulting a woman who we so clearly recognize, and even more difficult to reconcile such adamant denials with the truth that we saw.

Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams made us laugh, swoon and uncontrollably sob in equal measure, making for a seminal romance that still hits us right in the feels all these years later. But while that heartbreaking ending may be permanently seared into our memory, you might be surprised just how much went on behind-the-scenes that you weren\u2019t aware of. Read on for 17 facts you probably never knew about The Notebook\u2026 Director Nick Cassavetes only ever read the script so he could be convincing when he turned it down Nick Cassavetes almost didn\u2019t direct The Notebook at all. According to Entertainment Weekly, the project spent seven years in development limbo and was passed between various potential directors, before it eventually landed with him. The reason he even bothered to read it? So he could \u201cspeak intelligently about it\u201d when he turned it down. It seems the script won him over in the end, though, and he wound up directing it after all, and the rest is cinema history... But Nick Cassavetes wasn\u2019t the only prolific filmmaker who was linked with The Notebook According to an interview casting director Matthew Barry did with E! News, even Steven Spielberg had expressed interest in the script at one point. There were some pretty huge actors up for role of Allie, too Scarlett Johansson, Claire Danes,, Amy Adams and This Is Us star Mandy Moore were just some of the actors who auditioned for the role, as casting director Matthew Barry told the Daily Mail. Each with their own impressive resumes and plenty of romantic leading roles throughout their filmography, we\u2019re happy to say that missing out on this one didn\u2019t exactly set their careers back too much. Jessica Biel also had a particularly memorable audition experience In a 2011 interview with Elle, Jessica Biel remembered that The Notebook was one role she \u201cwanted so badly\u201d. It turned out she was willing to go to some pretty serious lengths to be in with a shot at playing Allie. \u201cI was in the middle of shooting Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I auditioned with Ryan Gosling in my trailer \u2013 covered in blood,\u201d she shared. \u201cNick Cassavetes put me through the wringer in an interesting, excitingly creative way. But there\u2019s a million that get away.\u201d And one pop star came very close to landing the role\u2026 It was actually Britney Spears who nearly won the role over Rachel McAdams, with casting director Matthew sharing that the \u2026Baby One More Time singer outperformed all the aforementioned stars. \u201cBritney beat out several of the top female actresses at the time,\u201d he told the Daily Mail. \u201cBritney beat out all of them. Everybody who was anybody that year wanted this part.\u201d Before this point, Britney had already starred in the 2002 teen road trip movie Crossroads, but quit acting soon after. We even have the audition tape, which is quite an emotional watch We can see why Britney nearly landed the role, because her audition was amazing \u2013 and she even managed to cry on cue. In her memoir, The Woman in Me, Britney reflected on auditioning for the part. \u201cEven though it would have been fun to reconnect with Ryan Gosling after our time on the Mickey Mouse Club, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t do it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf I had, instead of working on my album In the Zone I\u2019d have been acting like a 1940s heiress day and night,\u201d Britney added, referring to the fact that when she made Crossroads, she wound up finding her character hard to shake off. However, Rachel McAdams\u2019 audition just gave that little bit more \u201cWe were all sort of crying,\u201d Rachel McAdams recalled in a behind-the-scenes video about her audition. \u201cMatthew Berry, the casting director, was filming and he had to stop and get a tissue and stuff, it was really nice. And then we did the third scene and it was pretty electric.\u201d She added that it was \u201cthe best audition experience I\u2019ve ever had\u201d. After Rachel left, Ryan and Nick shared a hug out of relief from having found their Allie. And the actors who could have been cast as Noah were just as impressive Tom Cruise and George Clooney were just two of the actors considered for Noah, according to director Nick. But, as he told Entertainment Weekly in a new interview, he didn\u2019t want to see an actor that\u2019s already \u201cfallen in love with 10 other actresses\u201d on screen. \u201cYou get to the point where you\u2019re like, oh, look, it\u2019s Tom Cruise, falling in love with somebody different this time. It doesn\u2019t feel quite as authentic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we were lucky to have [Ryan and Rachel] at the beginning of their careers. And you really believed it.\u201d But there was one Star Wars actor who did not impress at all Hayden Christensen \u2013 otherwise known as Anakin Skywalker from the Star Wars prequels \u2013 was also considered for the role of Noah, according to an interview casting director Matthew did with E! News. Unfortunately, though, he failed to make an impact in the audition process. \u201cWe lasted probably 20 to 25 minutes and we were like, \u2018He cannot act,\u2019\u201d Matthew said. But the reason for Ryan\u2019s casting wasn\u2019t exactly flattering In a 2012 interview with Company magazine (via Vanity Fair), Ryan revealed that director Nick chose him for the role because of his looks \u2013 but not in the way you might think. \u201cHe called me to meet him at his house,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWhen I got there, he was standing in his backyard, and he looked at me and said, \u2018I want you to play this role because you\u2019re not like the other young actors out there in Hollywood. You\u2019re not handsome, you\u2019re not cool, you\u2019re just a regular guy who looks a bit nuts.\u2019 \u201d Have you taken a good look at Ryan\u2019s eyes in the movie? Ryan may be a blue-eyed heartthrob in most of his movies, but The Notebook isn\u2019t one of them. It was a subtle change, but Ryan opted for brown contacts in The Notebook to look more like James Garner, who plays the older Noah. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams bickered on set When you watch their on-screen chemistry, it\u2019s hard to believe that things were actually a little bit frosty between the leading stars behind-the scenes. In an interview with VH1, director Nick Cassavetes revealed things got so bad between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, at one point that the future Barbie star actually wanted his co-star replaced. \u201cRyan came to me, and there\u2019s 150 people standing in this big scene, and he says, \u2018Nick come here.\u2019 And he\u2019s doing a scene with Rachel and he says, \u2018Would you take her out of here and bring in another actress to read off camera with me?\u2019,\u201d Nick recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018What?\u2019 He says, \u2018I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do it with her. I\u2019m just not getting anything from this.\u2019\u201d Not unlike their on-screen counterparts, apparently they managed to resolve things after a bit of a shouting match. \u201cWe went into a room with a producer; they started screaming and yelling at each other,\u201d the director recalled. \u201cI smoked a cigarette and everybody came out like, \u201cAll right let\u2019s do this.\u201d Apparently things improved from there, with Nick suspecting that Ryan respected Rachel for \u201cstanding up for her character\u201d. \u201cThe rest of the film wasn\u2019t smooth sailing, but it was smoother sailing,\u201d he said. However, Nick has since admitted that he regrets dropping that bombshell, telling Entertainment Weekly this year: \u201cI regretted it. Everyone\u2019s like, why are you telling that? I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know. It caught me on a bad day, but if they are around, I apologise to you guys. I shouldn\u2019t have spilled the beans.\u201d Despite getting off to a rough start, Ryan and Rachel actually went on to date in real life The two actors clearly worked things out in the end, because they went on the date for real in 2005, about one year after the film came out (you might remember their iconic MTV Movie & TV Awards kiss). But they broke up in 2007, with Ryan opening up about the split in 2011. \u201cShow business is the bad guy,\u201d he told The Times of their breakup. \u201cWhen both people are in show business, it\u2019s too much show business. It takes all of the light, so nothing else can grow.\u201d Nick Cassavetes\u2019s real-life (Oscar-nominated) mum plays older Allie If the older Allie looked familiar in The Notebook, that\u2019s because she\u2019s the Academy Award-winning actor Gena Rowlands, known for her collaborations with her late husband John Cassavetes in films like A Woman Under the Influence and Gloria, both of which landed her leading actress Oscar nominations. She later received an honorary Oscar in recognition of her career in 2016. Nick recently revealed that his mother is sadly now living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, just like the character she played in the film. \u201cI got my mom to play older Allie, and we spent a lot of time talking about Alzheimer\u2019s and wanting to be authentic with it, and now, for the last five years, she\u2019s had Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly. And Gena Rowlands was seriously unimpressed when her son asked her for reshoots The film studio behind The Notebook felt the final scene could have been a bit more emotional, and asked for the climax to be redone with more tears from Gena\u2019s character. \u201cLet me get this straight. We\u2019re reshooting because of my performance?\u201d Nick recalled his incredulous mum asking at the time. He continued: \u201cWe go to reshoots, and now it\u2019s one of those things where mama\u2019s pissed and I had asked her, \u2018Can you do it, mom?\u2019 She goes, \u2018I can do anything\u2019.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the one time I was in trouble on set,\u201d he added, revealing his mum nailed her crying scene on the first take of reshoots.. One of the most iconic lines in the film was totally improvised It\u2019s one of the most famous lines of dialogue from the film, but Ryan\u2019s iconic \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d line wasn\u2019t actually in the script. \u201cThere was a scene at the end where Ryan improvised,\u2019 What do you want? What do you want?\u2019 And it became one of the most iconic things from the film [that] wasn\u2019t in the script,\u201d director Nick told VH1. \u201cHe just knew it. I\u2019m a literary guy, I was a lit major in college, and I like words, but I also like improvisation, [so] that\u2019s fine. But he was so on it. We just let him go. They deserve all the credit in the world, those guys.\u201d And another famous scene almost didn\u2019t happen at all Remember the scene where Noah and Allie row a boat through an impossibly perfect flock of white geese? That nearly didn\u2019t make it into the movie, but director Nick fought to make it happen. \u201cWe went into New Line and they were like, \u2018You can\u2019t do the birds. There\u2019s just too much \u2013 you\u2019ve got to take the birds out\u2019,\u201d Nick shared in an interview with VH1 (via Cheat Sheet). \u201cWe said, \u2018How come?\u2019 And they said, \u2018It just doesn\u2019t work. We talked to every animal wrangler \u2014 you can\u2019t do it. The birds aren\u2019t trained. You\u2019ve got to take it out\u2019.\u201d Thankfully, Nick didn\u2019t listen, and the team actually went to some pretty crazy lengths to make it happen. \u201cWe went down and bought a trailer like the back of one of those semis, talked to some of the animal people down there and bought a bunch of hatchlings and just raised them as chicks and marched them out to the lake every day and fed them out there,\u201d the filmmaker said. He added: \u201cBy the time the movie was shooting, they were kind of grown, but they had been fed out there every day.\u201d But Ryan wasn\u2019t convinced by another bird moment in the film Be honest, you know you\u2019ve recited it before: \u201cIf you\u2019re a bird, I\u2019m a bird.\u201d In an interview with MTV News, Ryan admitted that he wasn\u2019t entirely sure on the now-iconic dialogue when he first read it. Joking that he went to the \u201cMarie Kondo school of acting\u201d, meaning he prefers to cut dialogue that doesn\u2019t \u201cspark joy\u201d, the actor explained: \u201cThat line, I did not think was going to spark joy. It didn\u2019t spark joy in me. I said it and somehow\u2026 but it did. You don\u2019t know. You think you do, but you don\u2019t know.\u201d Oh, and did you know The Notebook is now a musical? The stage musical based on The Notebook opened on Broadway earlier this year, even scooping three nominations at the recent Tonys. Ingrid Michaelson handled the show\u2019s original songs, having previously worked on TV shows like Little Fires Everywhere and Tiny Beautiful Things.", "summary": "<div><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/667eb5522500001e007c1b6a.jpg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" alt=\"Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in The Notebook\" data-caption=\"Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in The Notebook\" data-credit-link-back=\"\" data-credit=\"New Line/Kobal/Shutterstock\" />Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in The Notebook</div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It\u2019s been 20 years since we first fell head over heels for Noah and Allie\u2019s epic (yet devastating) love story in </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/the-notebook/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Notebook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entertainment/topic/ryan-gosling\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Ryan Gosling</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/rachel-mcadams/\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Rachel McAdams</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> made us l", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/the-notebook-20-behind-the-scenes-facts-ryan-gosling-rachel-mcadams_uk_667eb48fe4b0415858d6a532", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/667eb8f62600001e007cd938.jpg?cache=EbIP8LFIKO&ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:39", "author": "Hollie Geraghty", "authors": ["Hollie Geraghty"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.007}

The guys break down Notre Dame defensive line recruiting, talk Irish quarterback commit Deuce Knight and more.\n\nThe show aired live on the Blue & Gold YouTube page Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET. Watch a replay of this week's show in the video player above.\n\nAlso, make sure to subscribe to the Blue & Gold YouTube channel for more video coverage of Fighting Irish football and recruiting.\n\nWhen The Athletic senior college football writer Ari Wasserman put together his post-spring top-25 rankings Tuesday morning, he headlined it with \"Does Notre Dame deserve to be in the top five?\"\n\nThe answer, he felt, was yes.\n\nWasserman slotted Notre Dame at No. 5, behind Ohio State, Georgia, Oregon and Texas, respectively.

Notre Dame hired OC Mike Denbrock back from LSU and added quarterback Riley Leonard through the portal. It addressed its receiver issues with Kris Mitchell and Beaux Collins. It should have one of the best defenses in the country with a ton of returning production.

USC could challenge the Irish in Los Angeles... maybe. The Trojans lost Caleb Williams and did very little to fix the offensive line that doomed them in 2023.\n\nLosing any other game on its schedule would be a disaster for Notre Dame. The 2024 slate is neither as daunting at the top nor as challenging in the middle as it was last season.\n\nAs for the Irish themselves, the remade wide receiver room certainly looks promising. Notre Dame needs to prove all the new weapons work together on the field to consider its issues addressed, though. And while the Leonard-Denbrock combination is exciting as well, the ex-Duke quarterback is also in prove-it territory after missing most of spring practice with his second ankle surgery.\n\nWasserman is dead-on about Notre Dame's defense, which should keep the Irish in every game.

While his comments don't directly impact Notre Dame, the comments were a reminder why the Irish program is better off with Kelly down in Baton Rouge.\n\nThere is no doubt that Kelly did a lot of good things at Notre Dame. You don't win 113 games by accident no matter how long you coach at a place like Notre Dame. While too much of the credit for the success in recent years is given to him, it would be unfair and disrespectful to not recognize the role he did play in helping the program bounce back after 20 years of mediocre football.\n\nBut Kelly's comments this week once again show why he had a self-imposed ceiling at Notre Dame.\n\nKelly was asked about LSU's inability to land a couple of transfer portal defensive tackles to address a major position of need for the Tigers. Kelly said the following about why they didn't land both players.\n\n\"We're not in the market of buying players,\" Kelly said to Jacques Doucet of WAFB. \"Unfortunately, right now, that's what some guys are looking for. They want to be bought.\"\n\nOn the surface, this seems like it has the potential to be a reasonable comment. If you're trying to build the right culture as a head coach, you have to be careful with the type of personalities you're adding to your program. You need to make sure any high school player or transfer you add are going to buy in to the bigger picture, and if it's only about money then you'll run the risk of tearing down the culture. You also have to be smart about where you commit the financial resources you do have.\n\nLet's be honest, this isn't really what Kelly is doing here, and Notre Dame fans who paid attention to his career see right through it. It's what Kelly always does, which is tamp down expectations, lower the standard and create built in excuses just in case things don't go well. Lower the bar, and that way if things work out you can take all the credit, tell everyone how wonderful you are and then ask for more money.\n\nThat was his modus operandi at Notre Dame. During Kelly's tenure he constantly talked about how winning was so hard at Notre Dame, and how stumbling block after stumbling block kept his program from being success. It wasn't his fault that Notre Dame lost to teams like Tulsa, South Florida, Navy, Northwestern, Duke and Pittsburgh despite having loaded rosters.\n\nIt wasn't his poor coaching hire at defensive coordinator in 2014, and unwillingness to make a change until it was forced upon him, that kept him from winning. It wasn't him allowing the strength program to bottom out that hurt the program, or his decision to go for two when already up 11, or to roll out a true freshman to throw a go ball when already in field goal range and down a point in the fourth quarter, or any other poor decision he made that kept him from reaching the pinnacle in South Bend.\n\nIt was the academic standards that forced those decisions, it was the lack of a chef for the football team that caused him to make some poor coaching hires. It was the cold weather in Indiana that forced him to \"shop down a different aisle\" at Notre Dame. So when Notre Dame fans hear Kelly talk about them not being in the business of buying players - when everyone knows LSU has done that in recent seasons - it sounds so much like the recruiting excuses he made at Notre Dame.\n\nHere's what I don't know, I don't know if Marcus Freeman will win a championship at Notre Dame. The only thing I can guarantee is that he won't win fewer than Kelly won at Notre Dame. Beyond that we still have a lot to learn about the Irish head coach. But here's what I also know, in just two and a half years, Freeman has destroyed all the false narratives that were created by his predecessor. Here's what I also know, when Freeman has fallen short he has owned it and sought to correct mistakes, he doesn't create excuses that allow him to point the blame in other directions.\n\nFreeman wasn't happy about how the 2023 season played out, you could see it on his face clear as day in the final two games of the regular season. Notre Dame finished 10-3, and were a yard away from beating Ohio State, and the ball bouncing a couple of different ways against Clemson away from being a much better team. They beat nine of their opponents by at least 21 points, something that has never been done in South Bend. His offense set a program scoring record of 39.2 points per game, and his defense was a Top 5 unit.\n\nBut when the season ended, we didn't hear the \"We just have to coach a little better and play a little harder\" talk like we did back in 2015 when the 10-3 Irish were a play here and a play there away from beating Clemson and Stanford to finish with a much better record. Kelly stood pat that offseason and didn't make a single change to his coaching staff, despite it being obvious the defensive coordinator was tremendously misusing the talent he had.\n\nThat 2015 season was followed by a 4-8 dumpster fire, and Kelly was then forced to make changes. Those changes were fueled as much by Jack Swarbrick and Bob Diaco (who helped Notre Dame get Matt Balis) as they were Kelly.\n\nFreeman didn't sit on his hands after the 10-3 campaign in 2023, he made changes. As soon as the regular season was over he let go of his receivers coach, and he made a huge hire at offensive coordinator, hiring Mike Denbrock away from LSU after the Tigers led the nation in scoring and total offense this past season. The Irish were far more aggressive in the transfer portal, and in about a two month period Freeman addressed multiple issues that he clearly felt were needed to advance the program.\n\nNo excuses. No blaming others. No using Notre Dame's high standards as a crutch. He went to work, garnered the support needed to bring about change, and improved the program. When I then see the latest comments from Kelly, I'm reminded of the stark contrast between how Freeman handles himself and how Kelly did.\n\nIt should be yet another reminder to Irish fans that while Freeman still has plenty to prove, the program finally has a head coach willing to do what it takes to get the most out of his program, and will do it all while embracing what makes Notre Dame unique.\n\nIt's a refreshing change.\n\nBe sure to check out the Irish Breakdown message board, the Champions Lounge\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nBecome a premium Irish Breakdown member, which grants you access to all of our premium content and our premium message board!

And it's always fun to put together an article on the #1 ranked Notre Dame Fighting Irish lacrosse team, it's always great to cover off on what's happened over this past week and it's so neat to look ahead to what is in front for our boys.\n\nI took a look back, and last year on May 10th, 2023 I wrote my \"Time to Be Great\" article here on OneFootDown. You can read what I wrote there as we looked to get our NCAA tournament run started with an upcoming matchup against Utah. Here is a quick snippet from my writing:\n\n\"No need to go through the full bracket and whether or not the Irish should be seeded #3, there is no time for that as the seedings are the seedings and they are set. With the Irish at #3, if things play out true to form, we would be looking at a Final Four of #1 Duke versus #4 Maryland and #2 Virginia versus #3 Notre Dame. I am only going to cover off on this quickly, but what Notre Dame lacrosse fan would not want to see the Irish avenge their only two losses in the regular season in the Final Four against UVA, and then try to change our 0-5 record in the postseason against Duke on Championship Monday? To be the best, you have to beat the best, and right now the seedings are saying that Duke and UVA are better than the Irish. It would be a fitting end to the 2023 Notre Dame lacrosse revenge tour and not sure I could imagine a more magical run for our first ever lacrosse National Championship (and of course Coach Corrigan's first championship as well). It's too far away to think about that and now it is only time to focus on the Utah game and \"Time to be Great.\"\"\n\nThings worked out pretty true to form last year with the only caveat being that it was Penn State versus Duke in the other semifinal matchup. Other than that, our Irish did what they had set out to do coming off the tough end to the 2022 spring. It was a season to remember and a weekend for the ages as we hoisted our first ever national championship trophy.\n\nNow we are here in 2024 and our Irish are ranked #1 and have are the #1 seed as the tournament gets underway this weekend. Notre Dame will play on Mother's Day on Sunday, May 12th as we will take on Albany who beat Sacred Heart in the play-in game on Wednesday night. This is the NCAA lacrosse tournament and because of that, every game will be a battle so it doesn't matter who Notre Dame plays, that team will be ready and fired up coming into Arlotta for a 5 PM EST matchup (ESPNU).\n\nLots more to write about around the tournament, but let's first look back at last weekend and what we saw as the Irish won the ACC Tournament in dominating fashion, first beating Virginia 18-9 and then besting Duke 16-6. Both games were played down in Charlotte and it was so awesome to see so many Irish fans in attendance to cheer on the team.\n\nI am not going to do a regular recap and cover off on each quarter in each game, but thought I would take a look at some of the key factors to our winning this weekend. From there we will look at the tournament and some additional Irish news as one of the things that happened this week was that the PLL draft took place.\n\nAll right, so much to talk about around Notre Dame lacrosse, let's get after it...\n\nNotre Dame Team Depth\n\nWe have been talking about this all year, but the Notre Dame depth was on full display on Friday and Sunday in Charlotte. Against Virginia, we saw FOURTEEN (14!!!) different players score goals for the Irish. On Sunday against Duke, it was NINE (9) players who got on the board with goals and THIRTEEN (13) overall players getting at least one point on the day. That is some serious rotation of the players and the the biggest thing we have been seeing of late is the rise of the third line midfield with Jalen Seymour, Bryce Walker and Fisher Finley getting run. We have been talking about this third line all season and hoping they will get their opportunity and over the last stretch of games they have finally gotten their opportunity....and it has paid off with massive dividends. Being able to run out nine offensive middies across the course of a game has made Notre Dame a more complete team. Not only can this line compete and run with any other midfield line in the country, but they give Notre Dame the chance to rest our top two lines so they can be fresher as the day goes on. I am not sure if any other team in the country is running three midfield lines, let alone having a third line that legitimately could be a first line midfield on most other teams in the country. Against Duke and Virginia, with the temperatures starting to get hotter and with stamina and energy being at a premium, the Irish were the fresher, deeper and more complete team on the field. This is going to pay off on a huge level here in May and I for one am beyond excited around what having three complete midfield lines can mean for this team in the weeks ahead.\n\nAlso noted within our depth is players like Fulton Bayman, Tyler Buchner, Jeffery Ricciardelli, Colin Hagstrom, Danny Parker, Andrew Greenspan, Will Maheras, BJ Burlace, Brock Behrman, Nate Schwitzenberg, Will Gallagher, Alex Zepf, Ronan Doherty and Thomas Porell getting some good run over the weekend.\n\nTo note, we did not see Christian Alacqua this past weekend, something for us to watch as we hope he is okay and ready to go for the NCAA tournament. He has been an important part of our SSDM unit this whole year, we will see what happens this weekend.\n\nStrength on Defense\n\nOn Friday against Notre Dame, Connor Shellenberger had zero goals and two assists. On Sunday against Notre Dame, Brennan O'Neill had one goal and zero assists. So across two of the best overall players in the country, the Notre Dame defense held those two to a total of one goal and two assists. And if you watched the game against Duke and saw O'Neill's goal, you know that was a generous opportunity to score his lone goal.\n\nLacrosse defense is a team game and while individual matchups are important and get studied / analyzed all week, what you have to be able to do as a team - when playing the game - is manage your switches, know your slide packages, play good off ball defense, and communicate as a team.\n\nNotre Dame did a tremendous job on all fronts this past weekend as we held two of the more talented offensive teams in the country to under ten goals in each game. And it wasn't just the close defense, but it was also our SSDM unit and our LSMs that continued to prove they are some of the best units in the country. It was a complete and overall dominant performance from our defensive unit and it really was fun to watch. They are peaking at the right time and kudos to the players and coaches for a job BEYOND well done.\n\nOutstanding Goaltending\n\nIncluded with our defensive talk is the goaltending for the Fighting Irish. And Liam Entenmann was just unreal this past weekend as he continues to prove himself as the best goalie in the country. It does not go unnoticed here how many times he makes difficult saves look easy and if you rewatch games on a regular basis, you will always find a save that Liam makes at a crucial time which prevents a run from our opponent, prevents a momentum switch, or prevents a closing of the scoring gap. These saves happen every game and we all know that lacrosse is a game of momentum. This is one of the biggest things that Liam does....stopping our opponents from even getting the chance to change the outcome the game. This is a stat that will not show up in the scoresheet, but it is the #1 reason he is the best in the country right now.\n\nFaceoffs and Time of Possession\n\nHow many times were you watching the Irish this weekend and seeing the ball in our offensive side of the field? The faceoff unit, led by Will Lynch, did an all around awesome job this past weekend and it allowed our Irish to play to the best of our abilities. When we win faceoffs, when we get ground balls, when we own the time of possession...there is not a team in the country that can beat us.\n\nDominating Consistency\n\nThere is just something about the consistent nature with which Notre Dame is playing lacrosse these days. Whether in person at these games or watching on TV, we have come to expect a consistent level of play from our Irish. This team comes to each game with a mindset to dominate and they have consistently delivered that over these last two months.\n\nLeadership coming to the forefront\n\nI don't think we can be talking about what Notre Dame is doing without focusing as well on the leadership that is embedded within this team. And that starts up top with our four captains: Liam Entenmann, Max Manyak, Eric Dobson and Pat Kavanagh. It continues with the senior class who has been so integral in everything Notre Dame has done in the last four years. They have kept this team focused, they have not let the team get complacent and they have kept their eyes on the ultimate prize. When we won the ACC tournament, it seemed like it was just another win, that is was just another weekend. Everyone on this team knows what the ultimate goal is and the leadership on this team is making sure that everyone knows where our focus is moving forward.\n\nPlaying your best lacrosse\n\nWith that leadership and with that dominating mindset comes some of the best lacrosse we have seen from Notre Dame this year. We are playing at an extremely high level right now and when we do play at this level, it is very hard for others to compete against us. No better time of year to be playing your best, and an awesome job by everyone involved to be where we are at today with this mindset.\n\nGreat Job by the Coaching Staff\n\nWhile the players play the game, it is the job of the coaching staff to put everything together and put the team in a position to win. This coaching staff has done a really good job throughout the whole season on a variety of levels. If you think about it, there was so much to manage coming into this year and coming in as the defending national champions. The fall was a celebration tour, the Princeton scrimmage was a wake up. Then when the season started, that Georgetown loss could have gone one of two ways. The way that it has gone has been exactly where the coaching staff wanted things to head and has gotten us to this point in the season. We are playing at an extremely high level with buy-in from every single player and person involved within Notre Dame lacrosse. Kudos to Coach Corrigan, Coach Wellner, Coach Wojcik and Coach Garnsey. Awesome work.\n\nTournament bracket and some thoughts\n\nHere is the full bracket breakout for the NCAA tournament as the sixteen team field is now set with Albany winning on Wednesday night. Not a ton of surprises in the field outside of the Ivy League only getting Princeton in. There could be a case for Yale, Cornell and Penn to all be in there, but Michigan stole a bid by winning the Big Ten. Other than that, there are a lot of teams that are coming off losses as we head into play this weekend. We could analyze this forever, but the seeds are set, the games are scheduled, and there is no better time to be a fan of college lacrosse than right now. Let's Go!\n\nLast year I picked the first round winners, but this season has been so unpredictable around matchups and who is the better team each and every week. If you put me to the fire, here are the teams that I think are making it to the round of 8:\n\nNotre Dame, Penn State, Duke, Princeton, Michigan, Syracuse, Virginia, Johns Hopkins\n\nNotes and Thoughts\n\nBig news this week for some of the Irish as the PLL draft took place on Tuesday night. Three members of Notre Dame heard their name called with Liam Entenmann going #5 to the Atlas, Pat Kavanagh going #6 to the Cannons and Eric Dobson going #12 to the Chaos. Congrats to these three players, and a special congrats to the Kavanagh family as Pat will be joining his brother Matt on the roster in Boston. What a family moment for them!\n\nUSA Lacrosse Magazine announced their All-American teams and NINE (9) Notre Dame players made the list. Congrats to the following:\n\nPat Kavanagh (1st Team), Ben Ramsey (1st Team), Liam Entenmann (1st Team), Will Donovan (2nd Team), Chris Kavanagh (Honorable Mention), Eric Dobson (Honorable Mention), Devon McLane (Honorable Mention), Will Lynch (Honorable Mention) and Chris Conlin (Honorable Mention).\n\nI don't have much of an argument across this except that I think Will Lynch should be higher as he has had such a good year. I also think Carter Parlette could have gotten an Honorable Mention spot at SSDM. Lastly, I would not have minded seeing Shawn Lyght being named an Honorable Mention for his outstanding freshman campaign.\n\nFred's Pics\n\nFred Assaf was everywhere this past weekend covering the ACC tournament down in Charlotte. Thanks always to him for his pics, they are so good and you can see them below. The close-ups from the Duke game are just AWESOME. All photo credits to Fred Assaf.\n\nWhat's Next\n\nThe \"Time to Be Great\" mantra is here. This is what this year has been building toward and it's crazy to think that in 18 days the 2024 NCAA lacrosse champion will be crowned in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Irish get our road to Philly underway with the Albany Great Danes coming to visit Arlotta for the first round matchup. Albany got here through winning the play-in game on Wednesday against Sacred Heart by a final of 13-7. They are led by LSM Jake Piseno who has been all over the internet this year with videos of his play and some of the goals he has scored. And like they always do, Albany has some dynamic offensive talent who will hit you with lots of creativity over the course of an afternoon. Definitely something to keep an eye on as the game gets underway on late Sunday afternoon.\n\nNo need for speeches or pep talks this year as the entire season we have been the hunted. We have done an unreal job of getting ready and prepared for each and every game we have played and we know we are going to get our opponents' best game. It has been seen time over time that this is a team that doesn't flinch and one that will be ready to show up and show out when the moment comes.\n\nI get the sense that winning last year took so much of a weight off so many peoples' shoulders as it relates to Notre Dame lacrosse and our first national championship. This group is playing free, they are playing unencumbered and it is noticeable and palpable. They are playing like the best lacrosse team in the country, they are playing each game like it is their last and they are playing for each other.\n\nContinue to do so this upcoming Sunday and we will be okay, we will show everyone what it means to play Notre Dame brand of lacrosse.\n\nIf you are near Arlotta, get there as it will be the last time to see our Irish in South Bend this season.\n\nAnd to all the Moms out there and to all the Moms in our lives (shout out Bridget, Jackie, Joan, Betsy, Kelly, Kate and Al), enjoy your day on Sunday, Happy Mother's Day. You deserve it each and every single day.\n\nFinal, final...the next Exit 77 podcast should be coming your way tomorrow on Friday. David Brogan and I will break down the ACC tournament and look ahead to Albany and the brackets as a whole.

Head coach Marcus Freeman and his staff have made strides in several areas as the program looks to get back to the top of the college football field.\n\nIrish Breakdown took a deep dive into the areas where Notre Dame is closing the gap under Freeman, and why the Irish are closer to being a legit title contender than they've been in quite some time. That was the primary topic of discussion in the video below.\n\nClosing the gap isn't just about what is done on the field. The football program needs support from the administration, and the breakdown above begins with a dive into what the leadership at Nore Dame is doing to better support the football program. Notre Dame has raised and spent a lot of money to upgrade the program, and that's the first reason to be optimistic. New apparent and TV deals also have raised the bar for Notre Dame.\n\nThat support has allowed Freeman to make very strong coaching hires, and also allowed him to retain important coaches already on the staff. Hiring Mike Denbrock and Mike Brown, and keeping Al Golden and Mike Mickens, are certainly important for Freeman and the Irish program.\n\nNotre Dame is also developing a much better roster, and the next segment of the show dives into those areas. Quarterback recruiting has certainly seen a major upgrade since Freeman was hired as the program's head coach. There is still plenty to prove from a production and play standpoint, but there is no doubt that the talent has upgraded with Riley Leonard from the portal, and landing prep stars like CJ Carr, Deuce Knight and Kenny Minchey.\n\nMickens has done a lot to upgrade the cornerback position, from both a recruiting and development standpoint. A position that was an issue for much of the previous 20 years is now not only a strength, but Notre Dame has one of the best cornerback rooms in the country. That is crucial to Notre Dame's success. The Irish have also greatly upgraded the depth of talent at linebacker, which is another area where Notre Dame is closing the gap on the top programs.\n\nOf course, Notre Dame is the trend setter at offensive line and tight end, so getting better in those areas is crucial to the Irish program and Freeman closing the gap.\n\nBe sure to check out the Irish Breakdown message board, the Champions Lounge\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nBecome a premium Irish Breakdown member, which grants you access to all of our premium content and our premium message board!

The Irish are 19-7 the past two years, coming off of a 10-win season and have recruited extremely well since Freeman took over.\n\nIs Freeman's squad ready to take the next step and go undefeated in 2024? That's a question On3's Andy Staples was recently asked on \"Dear Andy.\"\n\nAccording to Staples, it's definitely a possibility.\n\n\"I went to ESPN's SP+ ... it's a predictive model, so kind of like a Vegas power ranking, which is what they would use to set the lines with games,\" Andy Staples explained. \"So Notre Dame is No. 9 in SP+. The next closest teams to Notre Dame that are on Notre Dame's schedule are Florida State and Texas A&M. Florida State's 12, Texas A&M's 13.\"\n\nThe Texas A&M game is the opener for the Irish and will be played at Kyle Field in College Station. It's also the first game for new Texas A&M coach Mike Elko.\n\nThe Florida State game will be played in early November and could have College Football Playoff implications. Playing at USC (No. 23 in SP+) is another game that could be tough for the Irish, but Staples believes that as things stand, Notre Dame will be favored against all 12 teams on its schedule.\n\n\"Texas A&M is at Kyle Field, so remember, we're going to probably give them 3 points in the spread for home-field advantage. So that's probably a slight Notre Dame favorite or a pick 'em,\" Staples said. \"Florida State, obviously that's later in the season. A lot can change between now and then. But I believe Notre Dame, as the home team, would be a slight favorite. They're favored in every other game. Every other game. So they're probably favorites, as we start the season right now, in 12 of their 12 games.\"\n\nUpsets obviously happen every week in college football, and the Irish have lost some games they shouldn't have under Freeman.\n\nStill, it's at least possible Freeman's squad goes undefeated in 2024.\n\n\"Yea, undefeated is definitely on the table,\" Staples said. \"Is it easy?

President Joe Biden condemned the \"ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world\" on Wednesday in an address on Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nNotre Dame joined the ranks of colleges such as the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) and Columbia University in New York where student protests have been rampant. Protests at Notre Dame began at the end of April and continued this week, with a rally on Sunday just off campus.\n\nProtests have continued despite the arrests of 17 students on May 2 at about 10 p.m. in the pouring rain, according to the local newspaper The Observer. Earlier that day, students had attempted to establish an encampment on campus, but Notre Dame police confiscated the tent. After being asked to leave by school administrators, police arrested the students for criminal trespassing. Most students were released shortly with court dates set for June 28, though three protesters charged with resisting arrest had hearings on May 3.\n\nDays after the arrests, protesters gathered in front of the Notre Dame campus on May 5 at the cross-section of Notre Dame Avenue and Angela Boulevard for an \"All eyes on Palestine rally\" organized by the organization \"Occupation Free ND.\"\n\nOccupation Free ND published its \"demands,\" asking the university for the \"disclosure of invested fund[s] accompanied by genuine efforts towards divestment from weapons manufacturing companies\" as well as requesting \"Academic Boycott and Ethical Engagement with Universities in Israel\" in a post on X. The post also recommended that protesters wear face masks and cover any identifying tattoos and jewelry to the rally.\n\nFootage by local news station 16WNDU showed protesters holding signs that had slogans such as, \"Ceasefire now,\" \"We're a Catholic University funded by blood money,\" and \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nThese protests began at the end of April during the celebration of Notre Dame president Father John Jenkins' retirement.\n\nProtesters demanded transparency from the university on its investments in military contractor companies, that it reevaluate the university's ties to Israeli universities, and that the university alter a 1969 rule that requires protests receive approval from the administration in addition to other regulations, according to a statement by Occupation Free ND on X.\n\nThey also called for revoking a \"15-minute protest rule,\" which was designed in the wake of disruptive protests in the 1960s to prevent protests from impinging on regular campus activity, according to the university's website.\n\nWhile Notre Dame has prevented the protests from intervening with school activities, the same cannot be said for other elite colleges and universities.\n\nUCLA announced the cancellation of its largest graduation ceremony last week, while Columbia has reverted to online classes in addition to canceling graduation earlier this week.

For this week's throwback Thursday journey, let's rewind to 1984 and revisit the showdown between Notre Dame and Missouri. In the vast tapestry of college football history, certain moments are etched with an intensity that transcends time. The 1984 clash between Notre Dame and Missouri stands as a testament to the unpredictability and sheer drama that defines the sport. As the clock ticked down to its final seconds, the fate of both teams hung in the balance, poised on the precipice of victory or heartbreak.\n\nFor Notre Dame's head coach Gerry Faust, the game was more than a mere contest; it was a test of faith. With memories of past defeats haunting him, Faust found himself praying fervently, hoping against hope for a different outcome. But across the field, Missouri's nose guard, Steve Leshe, echoed a similar sentiment, his prayers mingling with the tension that permeated the stadium.\n\nAs I delve into the intricacies of this unforgettable showdown, I invite you to join me on a journey through time, where the echoes of missed opportunities and moments of brilliance still reverberate. As I look back on the 1984 Notre Dame vs. Missouri game, I discover a story full of emotion, excitement, and the lasting essence of college football.\n\nThe following excerpt is from the April 1, 1985 special issue of The Scholastic Magazine, which contained the 1984 Notre Dame Football Review.\n\nNotre Dame football coach Gerry Faust wasn't bashful. He admitted he was praying.\n\nSo was Missouri nose guard Steve Leshe: \"I'm an old Catholic boy and I was praying for the Lord to get the damn ball through the uprights.\"\n\nIt was strictly deja vu for Faust. In four seasons with the Irish he'd seen his team lose four times with less than a minute left on the clock.\n\nGive a kid a chance of a lifetime to beat Notre Dame with the pressure on and he'll come through every time.\n\nScott Campbell did. On September 26, 1981, his two-point conversion throw to Steve Bryant with :19 on the clock let Purdue beat the Irish 15-14.\n\nMax Zendejas did. On October 16, 1982, his 48-yard field goal as time expired let Arizona beat the Irish 16-13.\n\nMichael Harper did. On November 27, 1982, his one-yard scoring dive with :48 on the clock let USC beat the Irish 17-13.\n\nDoug Strang did. On November 12, 1983, his eight-yard run with :19 on the clock let Penn State beat the Irish 34-30.\n\nSo why should Brad Burditt be any different? Keep praying, Gerry.\n\nGive a 22-year-old senior from Monroe City, Mo., a chance to kick a 39-yard field goal to beat Notre Dame with seven seconds left and how's he ever going to miss? Especially when he has made every kick but two from inside the 40 in his entire career.\n\nBut Burditt missed. Plenty of people on both sides were surprised.\n\nThe kick was on target, but-like a pop fly-it didn't quite carry far enough. It landed harmlessly in the end zone. Fourteen out of 16 became 14 out of 17.\n\nBurditt, his Tiger teammates and coach Warren Powers took it like men. Faust and the Irish just took it.\n\n\"I stood behind three guys,\" said Irish linebacker Rick DiBernardo. \"I didn't want to see it.\"\n\n\"A lot of people would be lying if they said they didn't think of any flashbacks,\" said linebacker Mike Golic.\n\n\"I followed the flight of the ball all the way,\" said defensive tackle Mike Gann. At first I thought it would be too far to the right. Then it started coming back and I thought it was good. Then they told me it was short.\"\n\n\"Mr. Corrigan (Irish athletic director Gene) told me the difference between good teams and great teams is they win games like this,\" said tailback Allen Pinkett.\n\n\"The last three years that kick would have been good,\" said safety Joe Johnson, a senior who saw it happen more times than he cared to remember.\n\n\"I feel sorry for him as an individual,\" said Burditt's Irish counterpart, John Carney. \"He probably feels the weight of the world on his shoulders. He'd probably give anything to get that kick back.\"\n\n\"I was confident,\" said Mizzou quarterback Marlon Adler. \"I felt like, 'I want to get back on the bench so I can watch this.' I know Brad and I know what he can do. I felt like we had it. He's kicked those so many times. But this time, it wasn't in the cards. I knew it was going to be close. I was just hoping it would go, go, go.''\n\n\"When I hit it, I knew it was questionable,\" said Burditt. \"I didn't hit it properly. It's the most difficult moment of my career. I'm just a victim of circumstances.''\n\nA full house of 70,915 fans and a national television audience via ABC couldn't have expected a more finger-nail-dooming finish. There were plenty of miscues by both sides. But when a pair of high-powered offenses are shut down by sturdy defensive play, it makes for high drama on every possession.\n\nTouchdowns proved tough to come by-as Missouri proved on its opening drive. Stealing a play from the Notre Dame playbook, the Tigers warmed up in their traditional black jerseys, only to re-emerge just before kickoff in bright gold shirts and a cannon-full of hazy, gold smoke. It was a tribute to former Mizzou coach Don Faurot, the weekend's honored guest whose Tiger teams had worn all gold.\n\n\"Ever since I got into town, I had a feeling they might do something like that,\" said Faust. \"I saw advertisements that said, 'Wear yellow, or bring it to the game.' We heard rumors before the game they were going to wear yellow uniforms.''\n\nThe Tigers nearly struck gold on that initial march down to the Notre Dame one. But after quarterback Warren Seitz landed short on a third-down quarterback sneak, Eric Drain tried the skydive route on fourth down. The problem was Gann, who nailed him in mid-air. \"There was a hole and I filled it,\" said Gann. \"I didn't expect him to be in the air. He just popped up there right in front of me.''\n\n\"I was shocked that I was stopped,\" said Drain, who finished with a career-high 120 yards. \"I never should have left my feet. I felt those seven points. We didn't have those seven points because I was stopped.\"\n\nKeep reading here! (Bottom of page 19)\n\nThank you for joining me on this journey through history once more.

(WSBT) -- A local public and cyber safety leader is retiring. Mitch Kajzer served on the South Bend Police Department and was shot in the line of duty in 1992.\n\nToday, he is saying goodbye to Notre Dame and the St. Joseph County Prosecutors Cybercrimes Office.\n\nKajzer worked on an innovative program allowing Notre Dame students to assist in the county's prosecutor's office.\n\nHe has helped his students and this entire area navigate cyber safety, a unit he started in 2003.\n\nThat program is still running today.\n\nStudents are helping solve crimes and that's something not seen too often. But, before Mitch Kajzer and the University of Notre Dame, this didn't exist at all.\n\nAbout eight years ago, Kajzer helped Notre Dame students get hands on experience with cyber safety. They assisted in real world investigations while learning in the classroom.\n\nNow,10 other universities across the state have a similar programs.\n\nA program the St. Joseph County Prosecutor wasn't a fan of in the beginning.\n\n\"This is something I did not want to do. I thought it was a huge mistake. Our students, I don't even call them students, our investigators, do some of the best work in this line, then anybody else in the country,\" said Ken Cotter - St. Joseph County Prosecutor.\n\nKajzer has been in law enforcement in some capacity for the last 35 years.\n\nHe says his students are helping with actual investigations all across our area.\n\n\"Looking for anything related to the crime under investigation.

That's right ahead of his younger brother, Chris, a junior who has posted 30 goals and 29 assists for 59 points on the year.\n\nYou could have picked a number of scorers from this year's Irish team to represent the school as a Tewaaraton Finalist. Graduate senior Jake Taylor has the third-best shooting percentage in the country at .500. He has a team-best 35 goals on 70 shots.\n\nEntenmann, meanwhile, has the ninth-best save percentage in the country at .563. He's allowed 117 goals while making 151 saves. His goals against average of 9.34 is good for No. 6 in the nation. He's been a staple for the Irish in net for years and a key part of the program's success.\n\nEntenmann has manned the Notre Dame net for over 751 of the team's 784 minutes played this season. He enters the NCAA Tournament having been named the ACC Tournament's most valuable player. He's only the third goalie to ever be named a Tewaaraton Award finalist and the first since 2011. The award has been doled out annually since 2001.\n\nWolak leads Notre Dame with 54 goals and 38 assists for a total of 92 points. Only 11 players nationwide have more points than Wolak this season. She's the fifth Notre Dame Tewaaraton Award finalist on the women's side in program history and the first since 2016.\n\n\"Jackie is a special player and so deserving of this recognition,\" head coach Christine Halfpenny said. \"Her selfless play and team-first mentality is inspiring to the entire team.

Kavanagh said this is the healthiest collegiate season he's ever had with Notre Dame starting an NCAA Tournament run as the defending national champion against Albany on Sunday.\n\nHere are the highlights from Kavanagh's appearance on the show.\n\nPat McAfee Show: What's the general feeling of the team going into a game week?\n\nPat Kavanagh: \"There is a lot of scouting that goes into each week but our team is really focused on ourselves and we feel we got the deepest roster in the country so if we just come out and execute our game plan every week we're going to have success.\"\n\nPMS: Is this Notre Dame team better than last year's?\n\nPK: \"I'd say we're deeper, for sure, at a lot of different positions. Guys are more experienced. We had never won a national championship before so I think having that experience, making that run in May and getting that feeling of winning is definitely helping our team have a lot more success this year. And we picked up some good transfers in the transfer portal... We got a great team, and I'm excited for this run in May.\"\n\nPMS: How much is NIL a factor in transfer portal recruiting?\n\nPK: \"It's starting to gain more traction in the lacrosse world. I know a lot of different programs are getting into it. Not as much at Notre Dame. And obviously not as big of a deal as football. They got millions of dollars to play with and they generate the most revenue. Lacrosse isn't there yet but I feel like it could get there eventually.\"\n\nPMS: What can you tell us about Notre Dame dual-sport star Jordan Faison?\n\nPK: \"He's a freshman. He had a lacrosse scholarship out of high school. He's from Florida. Was an option quarterback in high school and then committed to lacrosse here. Walked onto the football team as a receiver and just killed it in training camp. Got a look because a bunch of wide receivers got hurt and then scored a touchdown against Louisville. Got a full scholarship for football. He's been balancing both. He's an incredible athlete. He's on our first line midfield. One of the best freshmen in college lacrosse. He's having a great year. He's got like 20 goals, close to 30 points. Not sure of his stats but he plays the whole game for us every game.\n\n\"And we also have Tyler Buchner, the former Notre Dame and Alabama quarterback. He transferred back to Notre Dame in January. He actually played in the Rose Bowl in January and then we had our first preseason practice for lacrosse here Jan. 9. He was at our first practice the week after unfortunately losing the Rose Bowl. But it was pretty cool seeing an Alabama, Notre Dame football player just chilling in the locker room with us. And he's actually starting to get a lot more time now. He's playing defensive midfield. Freak athlete. The kid is an insane athlete and he just keeps getting better at lacrosse. He was actually committed to Michigan in seventh or eighth grade for lacrosse then ultimately chose to play football. There are definitely some freak athletes in the sport of lacrosse.\"\n\nPMS: How do you feel about getting drafted by Boston in the PLL and having the chance to play with your older brother?\n\nPK: \"Me and my family have been manifesting that for the last year. I knew this was my last year, I was going to get drafted this year, so we had been talking about it for a while. They had the sixth pick and I was projected to go in the first few, so I didn't really think it was going to happen. But I guess how the draft shook out a bunch of teams needed players at different positions and I just fell right into the Cannons' lap at six. I was so happy.\"\n\nPMS: What are your thoughts on a potential rematch with Georgetown, who handed Notre Dame its only loss this season?\n\nPK: \"Haven't really thought about that much. They're a great team. We lost to them in February. I think we're a completely different team at this point. do get to play them, that'd be cool. But we;re looking forward to Sunday and we got to win that game first.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_horka@on3.com", "name": "Tyler

The first thing Hidalgo was asked elicited some laughter from the live audience, to nobody's surprise.\n\nHidalgo is appointment viewing, on and off the court.\n\n\"My teammates call me a gnat because I'm all over them,\" Hidalgo said when asked if she has a go-to nickname.\n\nThere were a couple other quick-hitting questions thrown Hidalgo's way. She said the high point of her career so far was Notre Dame winning the ACC Tournament in March. The low point was Notre Dame losing to Oregon State in the Sweet 16. She gave props to her parents and coaches for getting her to where she is today.\n\nHere's everything else Hidalgo said at the summit.\n\nOn arriving at Notre Dame and becoming one of the best players in the country as a true freshman...\n\n\"I know what God instilled in me. I know the gifts that he's placed in me, even from a young age. I'm big on my faith. I know God as blessed me with a talent so it's so easy to be able to just go out there and just play my game. Also, I have coaches and teammates that have so much confidence in me. When they tell me to go score the ball, we need you to score, we need you to play defense like you do, it just makes everything so easy to just go out and do it when they give you the keys to do so.\"\n\nOn Notre Dame head coach Niele Ivey being a players' coach...\n\n\"It's definitely a blessing to be able to have that connection with your coach, to be able to go to her and say, 'This isn't working' or 'What do you see? I don't know what to do in this situation.' It just makes the game so much easier and it makes me as a player want to run through a wall for a coach like that who gives everything and instills everything in you. It's truly a blessing to be able to have that connection with her.\"\n\nOn Notre Dame's chances of winning the national title in the next few seasons...\n\n\"Absolutely. Absolutely. Not to be cocky, but we have a lot of talent. Women's basketball in general has a lot of talent. You can find it all over. But we have a lot of injuries coming back and transfers, especially players like Olivia Miles coming back. A lot of people might have forgotten, but she's going to come back and shock the world with the talent she has. Emma Risch, Cassandre Prosper. We just have so much firepower coming back. It's going to be exciting.\"\n\nOn someone she looks up to...\n\n\"[Skylar Diggins-Smith], for sure. Obviously she went to Notre Dame, but she is just a dog on the court. Her being a smaller guard and just the defensive firepower that she brings, I'm able to look at that and kind of model my game after that.\"\n\nMore on what Ivey means to her...\n\n\"Just to persevere. Obviously Coach Ivey went through some stuff during the season, and just to be able to see her come out on the court with all the stuff that she had gone through and was still going through and still to be able to come to practices and talk to recruits even through everything that she had been through, it was amazing to see.

The Irish had several close calls down the stretch of the regular season, but they clobbered Virginia and Duke by 9 and 10 goals, respectively, in the ACC Tournament.\n\nNotre Dame enters the NCAA Tournament on a 10-game win streak. The Irish are the defending national champions, the No. 1 seed and the overwhelming favorite to go back-to-back. They earned a first-round matchup at home against UAlbany, starting at 5 p.m. ET on Sunday in South Bend.\n\nIt would be easy for a team in that position to pat itself on the back. Notre Dame -- not just the team itself, but most of the key players -- has a ring in its back pocket and has been the best team in college lacrosse for the past year. So was there a sense of accomplishment inside the Loftus Sports Center on Thursday morning?\n\nKavanagh, Notre Dame's all-time leader in career points (281) and assists (173), said the Irish had been scraping by on talent and effort. He thought the execution wasn't there, or at least not where it needed to be. At best, it was inconsistent.\n\nHe'd seen his team play to its potential in small stretches, but too often, it made games closer than it should have. Kavanagh pointed to Notre Dame's 14-12 win over then-No. 3 Syracuse, when the Irish took a 13-7 late-third quarter lead but let the Orange back into it.\n\nAs the Irish rolled through the ACC Tournament, though, they showed the lacrosse world what they can do if they play a complete game. The No. 2 Blue Devils, in particular, had no chance against a locked-in Notre Dame team.\n\n\"During both the Duke and UVA games, we were just so focused and weren't letting our foot off the gas,\" Kavanagh said. \"Having that mindset and keeping that same mentality going into the tournament will be huge.\"\n\nPutting together a full-team effort had been an issue for the Irish, too. Graduate student goalie Liam Entenmann mentioned Notre Dame's 18-17 win over Cornell on April 13, when he and the defense had an off day and the offense had to pull through. There were other games, Entenmann acknowledged, when the offense didn't produce as much and the defense had to take control.\n\n\"We never had a full effort from every aspect of the field,\" Entenmann said.\n\nThat changed in the ACC Tournament, but Entenmann, widely considered the best goalie in the college lacrosse, still wanted more.\n\n\"Honestly, even then, I feel like there were still some things we could've done better\" Entenmann said. \"I think that we have yet to play our best lacrosse, and hopefully we start to reach that point in the tournament.\"\n\nWith the success the Irish have had over the past year, they've also accomplished several things that could distract them from the task at hand.\n\nKavanagh going on the Pat McAfee Show, which he said was a surreal experience, is one of them. Entenmann, Kavanagh and senior midfielder Eric Dobson took a break from both finals week and tournament preparation to hear their names called in the 2024 Premier Lacrosse League Draft, with Kavanagh joining his older brother, Matt on the Boston Cannons.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" Kavanagh, who is nearly a decade younger than his brother, said. \"I've been watching him my entire career. I never really thought I'd have a chance to play with him.\"\n\nThese individual accomplishments, as well as the increased attention that comes with being the team to beat, are certainly worth celebrating. But Notre Dame takes pride in being an unselfish team that remains focused on the common goal.\n\nThe goal right now: Beat UAlbany. Nothing else.\n\n\"We're very aware of the fact that they're a conference champion,\" Entenmann said. \"They're a team that just won a game yesterday, so they have momentum and they're gonna give us their best. We're very prepared for them. We're certainly not looking past them.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_soble@on3.com", "name": "Jack Soble", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_lacrosse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College lacrosse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bend,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Bend, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ACC men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_at_Albany,_SUNY", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University at Albany, SUNY"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lacrosse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syracuse, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Syracuse, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannons_Lacrosse_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannons Lacrosse Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Lacrosse_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier Lacrosse League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/08140221/Pat-Kavanagh-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551631", "eventUri": "eng-9551631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-25", "textStart": 46, "textEnd": 53}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-13", "textStart": 2011, "textEnd": 2019}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Protests at Notre Dame began at the end of April and continued this week, with a rally on Sunday just off campus.\n\nProtests have continued despite the arrests of 17 students on May 2 at about 10 p.m. in the pouring rain, according to the local newspaper The Observer. Earlier that day, students had attempted to establish an encampment on campus, but Notre Dame police confiscated the tent. After being asked to leave by school administrators, police arrested the students for criminal trespassing.

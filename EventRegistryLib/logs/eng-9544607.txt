Following two weeks off, Nelly Korda will be going for a record-setting sixth straight win in the Cognizant Founders Cup at the Upper [...]\n\nCLIFTON, N.J. (AP) -- Things are going well for Nelly Korda these days, that's for sure.\n\nThe 25-year-old has won a record-tying five straight tournament starts. She has the No. 1 ranking in the world, along with the 2024 lead in earnings, scoring average and points for the player of the year award. And on top of it all, she got to live out a childhood dream by walking the red carpet at the Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nKorda will try to become the first woman to win six consecutive LPGA starts when play in the 72-hole Cognizant Founders Cup gets underway Thursday at the Upper Montclair Country Club.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who has not played since winning The Chevron Championship in Texas. \"Then obviously yesterday -- or Monday -- I had the Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nIn winning her second career major two weeks ago, Korda tied Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) for most consecutive tournament wins. Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nWhile she has been off the past two weeks, Korda said she never got far away from her game, despite catching up on sleep and spending a lot of time on the couch.\n\n\"There is two sides to it,\" she said. \"Obviously when I'm home, I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique. When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\"\n\nIn the past, Korda said she would come to events and do too much. Now she knows she has put in the work beforehand, and it's just time to execute when an event starts.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when Korda got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people-watching for me. I was just silently looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda was given a number of Oscar de la Renta dresses to try on, and seemingly settled on long-sleeve gown.\n\nTwenty minutes before walking on the carpet, she had a golf moment, like when the breeze picks up before a shot to the green. The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said. \"Switched it up on everyone. It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses. To be on the red carpet or green carpet was a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda has not fared well playing in New Jersey. She missed the cut in this event and the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in 2023. The Florida resident will be paired for the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 champion Minjee Lee of Australia. Lee lost in a playoff with Ko last year.\n\nHall of Famers Pat Bradley and Beth Daniel, who are here for the event that honors the 13 founding members of the LPGA Tour, feel the pressure is on Korda.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I watched when she won the fifth in a row and she said that was the most nervous she's been down the stretch,\" Daniel said. \"I can only imagine how nerve-wracking this week is going to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Just a few weeks ago, Korda took her fifth consecutive victory on the LPGA Tour, which also doubled as her second major win. Korda tied the record for the most consecutive wins, and will be looking to break that record this week.\n\nNelly Korda has been announced in the field for the 2024 Cognizant Founders Cup at the Upper Montclair Country Club, New Jersey. The 25-year-old took a break before coming to the Cognizant Founders Open, and became only the second golfer to attend the famous Met Gala.\n\nNow that she is back in action, Korda said that she will not be forcing another win or taking unnecessary pressure while playing this weekend. Already tied with Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam, Korda has the opportunity to break the record for the most consecutive wins on the LPGA Tour.\n\nSpeaking via SkySports, Nelly Korda said:\n\n\"I'm not trying to push anything. I hope that people see me for who I am and I love this game and doing it naturally. At the end of the day I think if you perform well in your sport that's what grabs people's attention. I'm not the type of person that tries to push anything or does anything I'm not really comfortable with. So I hope that I just do it naturally and that catches people's attention.\"\n\nNelly Korda has been winning continuously since January, but decided to withdraw from the JM Eagle LA Championship to rest up for future tournaments.\n\nNelly Korda talks about her experience at the Met Gala\n\nThe LPGA World No. 1 became the only golfer apart from Tiger Woods to attend the Met Gala. Describing the experience as amazing, Korda said:\n\n\"It was so, so crazy. You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're star-struck the entire time.\"\n\nGoing into this weekend, however, Korda has to be back at her full potential.

(AP) - Things are going well for Nelly Korda these days, that's for sure.\n\nThe 25-year-old has won a record-tying five straight tournaments. She has the No. 1 ranking in the world, along with the 2024 lead in earnings, scoring average and points for the player of the year award. And on top of it all, she got to live out a childhood dream by walking the red carpet at the Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nKorda will try to become the first woman to win six consecutive LPGA starts when play in the 72-hole Cognizant Founders Cup gets underway Thursday at the Upper Montclair Country Club.\n\n\"If I\u00b4m being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I\u00b4ve had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who has not played since winning The Chevron Championship in Texas. \"Then obviously yesterday - or Monday - I had the Met, so haven\u00b4t had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nIn winning her second career major two weeks ago, Korda tied Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) for most consecutive tournament wins. Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nFILE - Nelly Korda watches her shot during the final round of the Chevron Championship LPGA golf tournament Sunday, April 21, 2024, at The Club at Carlton Woods in The Woodlands, Texas.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nWhile she has been off the past two weeks, Korda said she never got far away from her game, despite catching up on sleep and spending a lot of time on the couch.\n\n\"There is two sides to it,\" she said. \"Obviously when I\u00b4m home, I\u00b4m definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique. When I\u00b4m out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much.

Now she knows she has put in the work beforehand, and it's just time to execute when an event starts.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when Korda got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You\u00b4re standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you\u00b4re like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they\u00b4re like famous singers and you\u00b4re starstruck the entire time.

The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said. \"Switched it up on everyone. It\u00b4s just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses. To be on the red carpet or green carpet was a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda has not fared well playing in New Jersey. She missed the cut in this event and the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in 2023. The Florida resident will be paired for the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 champion Minjee Lee of Australia. Lee lost in a playoff with Ko last year.\n\nHall of Famers Pat Bradley and Beth Daniel, who are here for the event that honors the 13 founding members of the LPGA Tour, feel the pressure is on Korda.\n\n\"I\u00b4m sure she can\u00b4t wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I watched when she won the fifth in a row and she said that was the most nervous she\u00b4s been down the stretch,\" Daniel said. \"I can only imagine how nerve-wracking this week is going to be.\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nFILE - Nelly Korda attends The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute benefit gala celebrating the opening of the \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" exhibition on Monday, May 6, 2024, in New York.

She has the No. 1 ranking in the world, along with the 2024 lead in earnings, scoring average and points for the player of the year award. And on top of it all, she got to live out a childhood dream by walking the red carpet at the Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nKorda will try to become the first player to win six consecutive LPGA starts when the 72-hole Cognizant Founders Cup gets underway Thursday at Upper Montclair Country Club.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who has not played since winning the Chevron Championship in Texas. \"Then obviously yesterday - or Monday - I had the Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nNelly Korda attends The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute benefit gala on Monday in New York. Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nIn winning her second career major championship two weeks ago, Korda tied Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) for consecutive LPGA wins. Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight PGA Tour wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she has been off the past two weeks, Korda said she never got far away from her game, despite catching up on sleep and spending a lot of time on the couch.\n\n\"There is two sides to it,\" she said. \"Obviously when I'm home, I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique. When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\"\n\nIn the past, Korda said she would come to events and do too much. Now she knows she has put in the work beforehand, and it's just time to execute when an event starts.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when Korda got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people-watching for me. I was just silently looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda was given a number of Oscar de la Renta dresses to try on, and seemingly settled on long-sleeve gown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty minutes before walking on the carpet, she had a golf moment, like when the breeze picks up before a shot to the green. The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said. \"Switched it up on everyone. It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat, though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl, I watched it growing up and (was) just in awe of all the dresses. To be on the red carpet or green carpet was a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda has not fared well playing in New Jersey. She missed the cut in this event, as well as the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in 2023. The Florida resident will be paired for the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 champion Minjee Lee of Australia. Lee lost in a playoff with Ko last year.\n\nHall of Famers Pat Bradley and Beth Daniel, who are here for the event that honors the 13 founding members of the LPGA Tour, think the pressure is on Korda.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I watched when she won the fifth in a row and she said that was the most nervous she's been down the stretch,\" Daniel said. \"I can only imagine how nerve-wracking this week is going to be.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

And on top of it all, she got to live out a childhood dream by walking the red carpet at the Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nKorda will try to become the first woman to win six consecutive LPGA starts when play in the 72-hole Cognizant Founders Cup gets underway Thursday at the Upper Montclair Country Club.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who has not played since winning The Chevron Championship in Texas. \"Then obviously yesterday - or Monday - I had the Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nIn winning her second career major two weeks ago, Korda tied Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) for most consecutive tournament wins. Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile she has been off the past two weeks, Korda said she never got far away from her game, despite catching up on sleep and spending a lot of time on the couch.\n\n\"There is two sides to it,\" she said. \"Obviously when I'm home, I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique. When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\"\n\nIn the past, Korda said she would come to events and do too much. Now she knows she has put in the work beforehand, and it's just time to execute when an event starts.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when Korda got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people-watching for me. I was just silently looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda was given a number of Oscar de la Renta dresses to try on, and seemingly settled on long-sleeve gown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty minutes before walking on the carpet, she had a golf moment, like when the breeze picks up before a shot to the green. The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said. \"Switched it up on everyone. It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses. To be on the red carpet or green carpet was a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda has not fared well playing in New Jersey. She missed the cut in this event and the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in 2023. The Florida resident will be paired for the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 champion Minjee Lee of Australia. Lee lost in a playoff with Ko last year.\n\nHall of Famers Pat Bradley and Beth Daniel, who are here for the event that honors the 13 founding members of the LPGA Tour, feel the pressure is on Korda.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I watched when she won the fifth in a row and she said that was the most nervous she's been down the stretch,\" Daniel said. \"I can only imagine how nerve-wracking this week is going to be.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

As boring as it sounds, or as many times as you're going to hear me say it, that's the motto and I'm going to stick to it.\"\n\nKorda, the first American player to win five LPGA titles in a season since Juli Inkster in 1999, found herself starstruck on the red carpet at the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\n\"Everyone was really amazing. The dresses were unbelievable and the whole evening was just a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda said no one recognized her, adding, \"I think I'm just a grain of sand in such a big room.\"\n\nYou won't find her in the sand often on the golf course these days.\n\nKorda started her historic victory run at January's Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida, then took a break before winning three times in as many weeks -- at March's Seri Pak and Ford championships and in April's Match Play tournament.\n\n'Simplify it'\n\nTwo weeks after that came a second major win after her first at the 2021 Women's PGA Championship. Now three weeks after Chevron, Korda is taking her \"Keep it simple\" strategy to epic levels.\n\n\"When I'm home I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique,\" she said. \"When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\n\n\"I've gotten in the past too caught up in coming out here and thinking I need to do a little extra when I've already done my work going into this event. It's time to just see my shots and execute them. That's how I've tried to simplify it.\"\n\nAmong the LPGA pioneers being honored this week is Pat Bradley, who said she is pulling for Korda to win her sixth straight start.\n\n\"All eyes are on her. It's going to be tough. It is going to be a challenge for Nelly,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does.

(AP) -- Things are going well for Nelly Korda these days, that's for sure.\n\nThe 25-year-old has won a record-tying five straight tournament starts. She has the No. 1 ranking in the world, along with the 2024 lead in earnings, scoring average and points for the player of the year award. And on top of it all, she got to live out a childhood dream by walking the red carpet at the Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nKorda will try to become the first woman to win six consecutive LPGA starts when play in the 72-hole Cognizant Founders Cup gets underway Thursday at the Upper Montclair Country Club.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who has not played since winning The Chevron Championship in Texas. \"Then obviously yesterday -- or Monday -- I had the Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nIn winning her second career major two weeks ago, Korda tied Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) for most consecutive tournament wins. Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nWhile she has been off the past two weeks, Korda said she never got far away from her game, despite catching up on sleep and spending a lot of time on the couch.\n\n\"There is two sides to it,\" she said. \"Obviously when I'm home, I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique. When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\"\n\nIn the past, Korda said she would come to events and do too much. Now she knows she has put in the work beforehand, and it's just time to execute when an event starts.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when Korda got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people-watching for me. I was just silently looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nKorda was given a number of Oscar de la Renta dresses to try on, and seemingly settled on long-sleeve gown.\n\nTwenty minutes before walking on the carpet, she had a golf moment, like when the breeze picks up before a shot to the green. The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said. \"Switched it up on everyone. It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses. To be on the red carpet or green carpet was a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda has not fared well playing in New Jersey. She missed the cut in this event and the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in 2023. The Florida resident will be paired for the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 champion Minjee Lee of Australia. Lee lost in a playoff with Ko last year.\n\nHall of Famers Pat Bradley and Beth Daniel, who are here for the event that honors the 13 founding members of the LPGA Tour, feel the pressure is on Korda.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I watched when she won the fifth in a row and she said that was the most nervous she's been down the stretch,\" Daniel said. \"I can only imagine how nerve-wracking this week is going to be.\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri":

It's very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing and it's wet this year so it's even worse.\n\n\"Just not getting too ahead of myself and taking it a shot at a time. As boring as it sounds, or as many times as you're going to hear me say it, that's the motto and I'm going to stick to it.\"\n\nKorda, the first American player to win five LPGA titles in a season since Juli Inkster in 1999, found herself starstruck on the red carpet at the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\n\"Everyone was really amazing. The dresses were unbelievable and the whole evening was just a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda said no one recognized her, adding, \"I think I'm just a grain of sand in such a big room.\"\n\nYou won't find her in the sand often on the golf course these days.\n\nKorda started her historic victory run at January's Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida, then took a break before winning three times in as many weeks -- at March's Seri Pak and Ford championships and in April's Match Play tournament.\n\n- 'Simplify it' -\n\nTwo weeks after that came a second major win after her first at the 2021 Women's PGA Championship. Now three weeks after Chevron, Korda is taking her \"Keep it simple\" strategy to epic levels.\n\n\"When I'm home I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique,\" she said. \"When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\n\n\"I've gotten in the past too caught up in coming out here and thinking I need to do a little extra when I've already done my work going into this event. It's time to just see my shots and execute them. That's how I've tried to simplify it.\"\n\nAmong the LPGA pioneers being honored this week is Pat Bradley, who said she is pulling for Korda to win her sixth straight start.\n\n\"All eyes are on her. It's going to be tough. It is going to be a challenge for Nelly,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does.

Wearing an Oscar de la Renta dress and her first spray tan, Korda was especially starstruck by Grammy-winning artist Shakira, who was also making her Met Gala debut.\n\n\"It was just a dream come true,\" said Korda.\n\nLife lately for the most dominant player in golf has been nothing but dreamy. Korda enters this week Cognizant Founders Cup in Clifton, New Jersey, with a chance to become the first player in LPGA history to win six consecutive starts.\n\nAfter capturing her fifth straight title at the Chevron Championship, she pulled out of the L.A. stop at Wilshire Country Club so that she could take two weeks to rest.\n\n\"First night, Sunday, I really didn't sleep much at all,\" said Korda. \"The adrenaline, you actually feel really sick. You can't sleep. The adrenaline wears off and the body starts to ache a little bit.\"\n\nAfter that, she was sleeping nine to 10 hours a night, which is standard when she's at home in Florida. The mental break was just as important for a player who is leading just about every area of the tour statistically.\n\nDuring the second week off, Korda hosted her first all-girls AJGA event, \"The Nelly,\" at the Concession Golf Club in Bradenton. She brought out one of the rescue dogs from Satchels Last Resort for the Junior Am. Marvel was up for adoption, and she hopes he found a home.\n\n\"You're your most genuine self when you see a puppy,\" said Korda. \"That really gave me a lot of positive energy.\"\n\nAlthough Korda, 25, is a 13-time winner on the LPGA and Oylmpic gold medalist, she doesn't feel that far removed from the AJGA. When she saw one junior warming up with a TrackMan on the range, however, she realized how much things had changed.\n\nKorda flew up to New Jersey on Saturday and played Upper Montclair Country Club on Sunday and then on Monday again before the gala. She doesn't have the best record in New Jersey, having missed the cut at this event last year as well as the KPMG Women's PGA at Baltusrol.\n\n\"This golf course is tough,\" said Korda. \"It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing. And it's wet this year, so it's even worse.\"\n\nOne player who is exceedingly comfortable this week is former No. 1 Jin Young Ko, who won last year's Founders Cup in a playoff over 2022 champ Minjee Lee. Ko is a three-time winner of the Founders, though her other two victories were at different venues.\n\nKo suffered a shoulder injury earlier this year that took her away from the tour for a month and a half and recently tied for fourth at the JM Eagle LA Championship.\n\n\"I think my game is going well,\" said Ko, who is back to playing (and sleeping) pain-free. \"Like, I think I found good direction to (be) going.\"\n\nNancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) are the only other players in LPGA history to win five consecutive starts.\n\nSorenstam said all she could see during a streak like that were fairways, greens and one-putts.\n\n\"If I hit a bad shot, it didn't affect me,\" she said. \"It just kind of repelled.\"\n\nIn her mind, Sorenstam knew plenty more good shots were coming.\n\nKorda, the first American player to win five times in an LPGA season since Juli Inkster in 1999, said she hasn't thought much at all about what it would mean to win six in a row. She's kept too busy.\n\nEarlier this week U.S. captain Stacy Lewis organized a Solheim Cup dinner and World Golf Hall of Fame members Pat Bradley, Beth Daniel and Meg Mallon were in attendance. Daniel and Bradley are being honored this week as LPGA pioneers.\n\n\"They are just so positive and so fun to talk to,\" said Korda. \"I just hope that when I'm in their position, girls my age will think that about me, too.\"\n\nPat Bradley was a fixture in the winner's circle on the LPGA Tour in the 1980s. She won 31 Tour events, including six major titles.\n\nBradley and Daniel are no strangers to monster seasons. Daniel won seven times in 1990, including a major, while Bradley won three of her six majors in 1986.\n\nBradley actually won the 1983 LPGA Chrysler-Plymouth Classic at Upper Montclair, which sits just 12 miles west of Manhatten.\n\n\"I mean, last night I said to Beth and Meg, how did I find this place? We didn't have GPS; we didn't have a phone,\" said Bradley. \"I must have stopped at 12 gas stations and said, 'Joe, where is Upper Montclair Country Club?' Because it was tucked back here so nicely.\"\n\nPerhaps one day Korda will be back at Upper Montclair, regaling players with stories about the time she \"felt like a princess\" at the Met Gala a few short days before she made LPGA history.\n\nThe stage is hers. Back in her Nike apparel, hair bun and visor, she hopes her work inside the ropes is enough to move the tour forward.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I think if you perform well in your sport, that's what grabs people's attention,\" said Korda. \"I'm not the type of person that tries to push anything or does anything I'm not really comfortable with ... I hope that I just do it naturally.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA",

It's very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing and it's wet this year so it's even worse.\n\n\"Just not getting too ahead of myself and taking it a shot at a time. As boring as it sounds, or as many times as you're going to hear me say it, that's the motto and I'm going to stick to it.\"\n\nKorda, the first American player to win five LPGA titles in a season since Juli Inkster in 1999, found herself starstruck on the red carpet at the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\n\"Everyone was really amazing. The dresses were unbelievable and the whole evening was just a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda said no one recognized her, adding, \"I think I'm just a grain of sand in such a big room.\"\n\nMore from this section Why fire departments need money for rescue boats Death Toll From Flooding in Southern Brazil Rises to 85 - TaiwanPlus News 'Survivor' exhibit highlights 18 local Holocaust survivors\n\nYou won't find her in the sand often on the golf course these days.\n\nKorda started her historic victory run at January's Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida, then took a break before winning three times in as many weeks -- at March's Seri Pak and Ford championships and in April's Match Play tournament.\n\n- 'Simplify it' -\n\nTwo weeks after that came a second major win after her first at the 2021 Women's PGA Championship. Now three weeks after Chevron, Korda is taking her \"Keep it simple\" strategy to epic levels.\n\n\"When I'm home I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique,\" she said. \"When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\n\n\"I've gotten in the past too caught up in coming out here and thinking I need to do a little extra when I've already done my work going into this event. It's time to just see my shots and execute them. That's how I've tried to simplify it.\"\n\nAmong the LPGA pioneers being honored this week is Pat Bradley, who said she is pulling for Korda to win her sixth straight start.\n\n\"All eyes are on her. It's going to be tough. It is going to be a challenge for Nelly,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does.

Grace Kim of Australia was three shots back, and eight other golfers were four back.\n\nKorda holding steady on back nine\n\nOn the back nine, Korda started with a par on the first hole and then made easy work of the Par 5 second hole to get within three shots of the lead, but Madelene Sagstrom has increased her lead after a birdie on three straight holes and is the leader at 7-under through 16 holes.\n\nKorda sinks birdie putt to drop to -1\n\nKorda finished her Thursday Front 9 on a positive note: She sank a lengthy birdie putt to drop to one-under in the tournament. It's her second birdie of the day, though she did bogey the Par 4 13th hole.\n\nNelly Korda score\n\nThrough nine holes in Thursday's Round 1, Korda is one-under (tied for 11th).\n\nHow to watch Nelly Korda at the Cognizant Founders Cup\n\nESPN+ and Peacock broadcast the Cognizant Founders Cup beginning Thursday.

She has the No.1 ranking in the world, along with the 2024 lead in earnings, scoring average and points for the player of the year award.\n\nAnd on top of it all, she got to live out a childhood dream by walking the red carpet at the Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nNow Korda will try to become the first woman to win six consecutive LPGA events when play in the Founders Cup gets underway on Thursday at the Upper Montclair Country Club in suburban New York.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who has not played since winning the Chevron Championship in Texas.\n\n\"Then obviously on Monday I had the Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nIn winning her second career major two weeks ago, Korda tied Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) for most consecutive tournament wins. Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when she got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time.\n\n\"It's the best people-watching for me. I was just silently looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda was given a number of Oscar de la Renta dresses to try on, and seemingly settled on long-sleeve gown.\n\nTwenty minutes before walking on the carpet, she had a golf moment, like when the breeze picks up before a shot to the green. The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said.\n\n\"Switched it up on everyone. It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses.

On Monday, she was in New York City, walking the carpet at the Met Gala.\n\n\"I haven't had too much time to think about it,\" Korda said of the record amid her busy schedule.\n\nShe said her mind has otherwise been focused on ramping up her training and the course at Upper Montclair Country Club, which is the site of this weekend's Cognizant Founders Cup and also where she failed to make the cut last May.\n\n\"This golf course is tough,\" Korda said. \"It's very, very narrow off the tee, the rough is very penalizing. And it's wet this year, so it's even worse.\n\n\"So just not getting too ahead of myself and taking it a shot at a time. As boring as it sounds or as many times as you guys are going to hear me say it, that is the motto and I'm going to stick to it.\"\n\nIn addition to missing the cut at last year's Cognizant Founders Cup, Korda also didn't make it to the weekend at the following event -- the KPMG Women's PGA Championship, which was also held in New Jersey.\n\n\"My track record hasn't been the greatest in New Jersey,\" Korda said. \"So I'm really just trying to keep it one shot at a time, and see how it goes.\"\n\nHer winning streak began in late January, with a win at the LPGA Drive On Championship in Bradenton. After a seven-week layoff, she returned to action in mid-March, then rattled off three more wins before taking a break the week before the Chevron Championship.\n\nKorda admitted the stretch has been mentally taxing, particularly as she's gotten closer to the record. It's why she skipped the JM Eagle LA Championship in Los Angeles after her last win.\n\n\"I just felt like mentally, I just needed the rest,\" Korda said. \"I was just so mentally tired going through all those situations and high-pressure moments.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_Founders_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LPGA Founders Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Golf Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clifton, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clifton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montclair,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montclair, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montclair, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradenton,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JM_Eagle_LA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JM Eagle LA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_Drive_On_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LPGA Drive On Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0417%2Fr1320392_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clifton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

As she stood in line waiting to walk the green carpet - the dress code was \"The Garden of Time\" - Korda was mostly silent as she took in the scene. Wearing an Oscar de la Renta dress and her first spray tan, Korda was especially starstruck by Grammy-winning artist Shakira, who was also making her Met Gala debut.\n\n\"It was just a dream come true,\" said Korda.\n\nLife lately for the most dominant player in golf has been nothing but dreamy. Korda enters this week Cognizant Founders Cup in Clifton, New Jersey, with a chance to become the first player in LPGA history to win six consecutive starts.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Nelly (@nellykorda)\n\nAfter capturing her fifth straight title at the Chevron Championship, she pulled out of the L.A. stop at Wilshire Country Club so that she could take two weeks to rest.\n\n\"First night, Sunday, I really didn't sleep much at all,\" said Korda. \"The adrenaline, you actually feel really sick. You can't sleep. The adrenaline wears off and the body starts to ache a little bit.\"\n\nAfter that, she was sleeping nine to 10 hours a night, which is standard when she's at home in Florida. The mental break was just as important for a player who is leading just about every area of the tour statistically.\n\nDuring the second week off, Korda hosted her first all-girls AJGA event, \"The Nelly,\" at the Concession Golf Club in Bradenton. She brought out one of the rescue dogs from Satchels Last Resort for the Junior Am. Marvel was up for adoption, and she hopes he found a home.\n\n\"You're your most genuine self when you see a puppy,\" said Korda. \"That really gave me a lot of positive energy.\"\n\nAlthough Korda, 25, is a 13-time winner on the LPGA and Oylmpic gold medalist, she doesn't feel that far removed from the AJGA. When she saw one junior warming up with a TrackMan on the range, however, she realized how much things had changed.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by American Jr Golf Association (@ajgagolf)\n\nKorda flew up to New Jersey on Saturday and played Upper Montclair Country Club on Sunday and then on Monday again before the gala. She doesn't have the best record in New Jersey, having missed the cut at this event last year as well as the KPMG Women's PGA at Baltusrol.\n\n\"This golf course is tough,\" said Korda. \"It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing. And it's wet this year, so it's even worse.\"\n\nOne player who is exceedingly comfortable this week is former No. 1 Jin Young Ko, who won last year's Founders Cup in a playoff over 2022 champ Minjee Lee. Ko is a three-time winner of the Founders, though her other two victories were at different venues.\n\nKo suffered a shoulder injury earlier this year that took her away from the tour for a month and a half and recently tied for fourth at the JM Eagle LA Championship.\n\n\"I think my game is going well,\" said Ko, who is back to playing (and sleeping) pain-free. \"Like, I think I found good direction to (be) going.\"\n\nNancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) are the only other players in LPGA history to win five consecutive starts.\n\nSorenstam said all she could see during a streak like that were fairways, greens and one-putts.\n\n\"If I hit a bad shot, it didn't affect me,\" she said. \"It just kind of repelled.\"\n\nIn her mind, Sorenstam knew plenty more good shots were coming.\n\nKorda, the first American player to win five times in an LPGA season since Juli Inkster in 1999, said she hasn't thought much at all about what it would mean to win six in a row. She's kept too busy.\n\nEarlier this week U.S. captain Stacy Lewis organized a Solheim Cup dinner and World Golf Hall of Fame members Pat Bradley, Beth Daniel and Meg Mallon were in attendance. Daniel and Bradley are being honored this week as LPGA pioneers.\n\n\"They are just so positive and so fun to talk to,\" said Korda. \"I just hope that when I'm in their position, girls my age will think that about me, too.\"\n\nPat Bradley was a fixture in the winner's circle on the LPGA Tour in the 1980s. She won 31 Tour events, including six major titles.\n\nBradley and Daniel are no strangers to monster seasons. Daniel won seven times in 1990, including a major, while Bradley won three of her six majors in 1986.\n\nBradley actually won the 1983 LPGA Chrysler-Plymouth Classic at Upper Montclair, which sits just 12 miles west of Manhatten.\n\n\"I mean, last night I said to Beth and Meg, how did I find this place? We didn't have GPS; we didn't have a phone,\" said Bradley. \"I must have stopped at 12 gas stations and said, 'Joe, where is Upper Montclair Country Club?' Because it was tucked back here so nicely.\"\n\nPerhaps one day Korda will be back at Upper Montclair, regaling players with stories about the time she \"felt like a princess\" at the Met Gala a few short days before she made LPGA history.\n\nThe stage is hers. Back in her Nike apparel, hair bun and visor, she hopes her work inside the ropes is enough to move the tour forward.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I think if you perform well in your sport, that's what grabs people's attention,\" said Korda. \"I'm not the type of person that tries to push anything or does anything I'm not really comfortable with ... I hope that I just do it naturally.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_ann_nichols@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "Beth

Her look received wide praise from fans on social media.\n\nNelly Korda is having an amazing season and has won five back-to-back titles on the LPGA Tour, the most recent being the Chevron Championship. Once again, she stole the show, but this time at the Met Gala, which took place on Monday. For the uninitiated, the Met Gala is an annual fashion event where stars from multiple fields make appearances at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe world No. 1 golfer was a guest of Casey Wasserman at this year's Met Gala. Korda sported a red and green floral ankle-length dress based on this year's theme, 'Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.' Her dress was designed by acclaimed designer Oscar de la Renta.\n\nFans online showered praise on Korda for her amazing fashion and for impressing on the field outside of golf. Here's a look at some of the responses:\n\n\"with Ms Korda's Beauty and equally impressive Golf skills, it's easy to understand her record of success. KUDOS,\" one fan praised.\n\n\"Gorgeous! Nelly is an exceptional woman, on & off the course,\" this user commented.\n\nIs Nelly Korda the first golfer to attend the Met Gala?\n\nNelly Korda received wide praise for her appearance at this year's Met Gala. She became the first LPGA Tour star to attend the annual fashion event. However, she is not the first golfer to do so.\n\nBefore Korda, Tiger Woods attended the Met Gala in 2013 with his then-partner and former Olympian Lindsey Vonn. While golfers have made rare appearances at the event, many athletes from other sports have been regular features. Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Megan Rapinoe, Tom Brady, Simone Biles, Lewis Hamilton, and many other sports superstars have graced the event.\n\nThis year, the likes of Hamilton, Odell Beckham Jr., Angel Reese, Serena Williams, and her sister Venus Williams graced the Met Gala with their presence.\n\nAs for Nelly Korda, she will return to action with the 2024 Cognizant Founders Cup after a two-week break. The event will take place at Upper Montclair Country Club from Thursday, May 9th to Sunday, May 12th.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shobhit_kukreti@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Shobhit Kukreti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_de_la_Renta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar de la Renta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Beckham_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odell Beckham Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Vonn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Vonn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Rapinoe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megan Rapinoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venus Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montclair,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montclair, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montclair, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/75a26-17150800757900-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 149, "textEnd": 154}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 2194, "textEnd": 2201}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 2213, "textEnd": 2221}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

She has the No.1 ranking in the world, along with the 2024 lead in earnings, scoring average and points for the player of the year award.\n\nAnd on top of it all, she got to live out a childhood dream by walking the red carpet at the Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nNow Korda will try to become the first woman to win six consecutive LPGA events when play in the Founders Cup gets underway on Thursday at the Upper Montclair Country Club in suburban New York.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who has not played since winning the Chevron Championship in Texas.\n\n\"Then obviously on Monday I had the Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nIn winning her second career major two weeks ago, Korda tied Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) for most consecutive tournament wins. Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when she got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time.\n\n\"It's the best people-watching for me. I was just silently looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda was given a number of Oscar de la Renta dresses to try on, and seemingly settled on long-sleeve gown.\n\nTwenty minutes before walking on the carpet, she had a golf moment, like when the breeze picks up before a shot to the green. The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said.\n\n\"Switched it up on everyone. It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses.

It was there that Korda mingled with celebrities from across multiple industries, all showing off the latest from some of the world's greatest fashion designers.\n\nAttending the prestigious event was a childhood dream come true, says Korda, who revealed that she tried on a couple Oscar de la Renta, decided on one and then 20 minutes before she was supposed to begin getting ready switched to a different dress.\n\n\"I had to completely change my entire look,\" Korda said. \"I was going to go with a long-sleeve gown, so I was going to have my hair up. Then I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready. Switched it up on everyone.\"\n\nKorda then looked down at her golf attire.\n\n\"This is my comfort zone,\" she added. \"It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that. That was my first time ever walking a red carpet and went out with a bang. I think it's just downhill from here.\"\n\nAs a self-described \"grain of sand in such a big, big room,\" Korda said she was especially starstruck by Shakira. She also had Jaden Smith come up and introduce himself.\n\n\"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet, and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies, and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time,'\" Korda said. \"It's the best people watching for me. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nNow, it's back to reality for Korda, who is tied with Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam for the LPGA record for consecutive victories. She hasn't competed since winning the Chevron Championship, taking the past two weeks off to recharge. She said she slept nearly 10 hours the first few nights back home in Bradenton, Florida, before ramping up her training last week. She also spent some time last weekend at the AJGA event she hosts at Concession Golf Club, capping a busy break that has given Korda little chance to think about the history that's at stake this week at Upper Montclair Country Club in Clifton, New Jersey.\n\n\"What was crazy to me is there was this one girl that was warming up on the range with a TrackMan,\" Korda said. \"I was like, I don't remember any of this in junior golf. ... It's pretty incredible and amazing to see how dedicated the girls are at a really, really young age as well.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old Korda, not that far removed from junior golf herself, surely is inspiring all those young girls right now. In her mind, though, she's not trying to do anything special.\n\n\"I'm just out here doing what I love and hopefully that's what grows the game naturally,\" Korda said. \"I'm not trying to push anything. I hope that people see me for who I am, and I love this game and doing it naturally.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I think if you perform well in your sport, that's what grabs people's attention.\"\n\nAfter a night of turning heads with her fashion, Korda is back to letting her clubs do the talking.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_Founders_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA Founders Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_de_la_Renta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar de la Renta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fashion design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakira", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shakira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alpine skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Junior_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Junior Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montclair,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montclair, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montclair, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clifton, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clifton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradenton,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f57e62/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2813+0+260/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0e%2F8a%2F2e838e694212b7ba15e60f8caaa3%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2151815206", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The current World No.1 golfer recently graced the Met Gala alongside the glamorous stars of the entertainment industry.\n\nNelly Korda wore an elegant red floral dress designed by renowned designer Oscar de la Renta. The golf prodigy dazzled in a stunning off-shoulder gown with a beautiful necklace.\n\nHer look received praise from Paige Spiranac, who took to her X (formerly Twitter) account to laud Nelly Korda. She wrote:\n\n\"Love seeing Nelly at the Met Gala! She looks amazing.\"\n\nNelly Korda became the first LPGA Tour player to attend the Met Gala event. However, she is not the only golfer to have attended the event. Before her, in 2013, Tiger Woods attended the Met Gala with his then-girlfriend Lindsey Vonn.\n\nNelly Korda set to play at 2024 Cognizant Founders Day\n\nNelly Korda will compete in this week's Cognizant Founders Day event, the next stop on the LPGA Tour. The tournament will commence with its first round on Thursday, May 9, and will continue through the weekend, concluding on Sunday, May 12, at Upper Montclair Country Club.\n\nHaving secured victory in five consecutive tournaments in 2024, Korda is aiming for her sixth consecutive win at the upcoming event. Her winning streak began at the 2024 LPGA Drive On Championship, where she shot four rounds of 65, 67, 68, and 73 to claim victory. This was followed by another win at the FIR Hills Series PAK Championship.\n\nNelly Korda also triumphed at the Ford Championship, marking it as her third consecutive win of the season. She also lifted the trophy at the T-Mobile Match Play presented by MGM Rewards, followed by another victory at The Chevron Championship, the first Major of the year.\n\nReflecting on her win at The Chevron Championship, Korda said (via Golf Digest):\n\n\"It was not an easy decision. After the unbelievable week at The Chevron and grinding through the mental and physical challenges of four events in the past five weeks, I am definitely feeling exhausted.

She joined Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) as the only players in LPGA Tour history to win five straight starts.\n\nKorda played 25 holes on the final day to make up for a weather delay on Saturday on her way to winning her 13th LPGA Tour event. She was able to stay in the moment and make clutch shots down the stretch.\n\n\"I feel like every time I do learn more about myself and I can lean on what I've practiced on and I can lean on the situations that I've been through to help me through that and to really take it a shot at a time,\" Korda said Wednesday.\n\n\"Getting ahead of yourself is just going to lead you down a bad, bad rabbit hole. We made sure we were very, very present coming down the stretch. Even if I had a five-shot lead I was still going to be very nervous.\n\n\"To be very present during that time really helped me to soak in the entire moment as well.\"\n\nIt could apply to her Monday evening in New York City, and to her approach to the possibility of a record-breaking result this weekend in New Jersey.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who took a short break from the tour and hosted her first junior amateur event. \"Then obviously yesterday -- or Monday I had The Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nShe noted that her \"track record hasn't been the greatest in New Jersey,\" as she missed the cut at this event as well as the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in 2023.\n\n\"I'm really just trying to keep it one shot at time, see how it goes,\" Korda said. \"This golf course is tough. It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing. And it's wet this year, so it's even worse.\n\n\"So just not getting too ahead of myself and taking it a shot at a time.

On Monday night, the 25-year-old from Bradenton, Florida, stepped onto the red carpet at potentially the world's most prestigious fashion event - the Met Gala in New York.\n\nThe Met Gala takes place every year in the first week of May as a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in Manhattan. It is widely considered to be \"fashion's biggest night\" and includes \"culturally-relevant\" faces among contemporary society from a variety of different circles - including sport, fashion, business, entertainment, and politics.\n\nInvitations - sent out by fashion icon, Anna Wintour - are highly-sought after, with tickets costing $75,000 each in 2024 - up from $50,000 per person in 2023. Korda was on the list as a guest of Casey Wasserman, the chair of her agency.\n\nAnd dressing to impress at the who's who of current pop-culture, Korda wore a poppy-covered dress created by famous designer, Oscar de le Renta.\n\nWhile golfers are rarely included on the Met Gala's guest list, Tiger Woods was the most recent in 2013, Korda is believed to be the first LPGA Tour golfer ever to have stepped foot inside the unique event.\n\nKorda belonged to a wider group of sporting faces at this year's Met Gala, too, with the likes of WNBA star Angel Reese, tennis legend Serena Williams, Australian NBA player Ben Simmons, and NFL icon Odell Beckham Jr also in attendance.\n\nFollowing her night in front of the paparazzi, Korda will return to more comfortable surroundings on the golf course. Although, the pressure could well be just as intense as the Floridian attempts to secure a sixth LPGA Tour crown at this week's Cognizant Founder's Cup.\n\nShould Korda lift the trophy, she would become the first woman ever to claim six LPGA Tour titles in a row - surpassing her joint-record alongside Annika Sorenstam and Nancy Lopez.\n\nKorda was due to play in the JM Eagle LA Championship the week after she scooped number five - the Chevron Championship , which just so happened to also be her second career Major - but withdrew citing exhaustion.\n\nIn a statement, she said: \"It was not an easy decision. After the unbelievable week at The Chevron and grinding through the mental and physical challenges of four events in the past five weeks, I am definitely feeling exhausted.\n\n\"With so much still to come throughout 2024, I feel I need to listen to my body and get some rest, so I can be ready for the remainder of the season.\"\n\nThe World No.1 - fresh off the back of an iconic appearance in New York - will now look to further cement her place as the player everyone is looking at this weekend.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradenton,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JM_Eagle_LA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JM Eagle LA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntwSovXKdAR5Sd8bFSbCgX-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

I hope that people see me for who I am and I love this game and doing it naturally.\n\n\"At the end of the day I think if you perform well in your sport that's what grabs people's attention. I'm not the type of person that tries to push anything or does anything I'm not really comfortable with. So I hope that I just do it naturally and that catches people's attention.\"\n\nSpeaking about the experience, Korda added: \"It was so, so crazy. You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're star-struck the entire time.\n\n\"It's the best people watching for me. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses. I would say like I saw Shakira and I just love Shakira. She's so beautiful. Then Jaden Smith was really, really nice. He was the first person to say hello to me and introduce himself. Everyone was really amazing.\"\n\nKorda claimed her second major title and fifth straight victory in the Chevron Championship last month, equalling the record set by Nancy Lopez in 1978 and matched by Annika Sorenstam (2004-05).\n\nWhen asked whether she is confident of extending the winning streak this week, Korda said: \"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on these two weeks. On Monday I had The Met, so haven't had too much time to think about it.\n\n\"My track record hasn't been the greatest in New Jersey. Last year missed the cut and we played KPMG here last year too and that was a nice missed cut as well. I'm really just trying to keep it one shot at time, see how it goes.\n\n\"This golf course is tough. It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalising. And it's wet this year, so it's even worse. So just not getting too ahead of myself and taking it a shot at a time. As boring as it sounds or as many times as you're going to hear me say it, that's the motto and I'm going to stick to it.\"\n\nWill Nelly Korda continue her winning streak?

She was even par through the first eight holes at Upper Montclair Country Club, which might seem just average to those who were expecting immediate dominance, but Korda's brilliance this year has been outlasting everyone over 72 holes, not the first nine or 18.\n\nHer second birdie of the day arrived on the 18th hole, her ninth, and then another followed on the next par-5, her 11th of the day. Korda is one of the longest players in the women's game, so that's a bit of the same story, too. Hitting one good drive with her length allows her to turn par-5s into long par-3s. She played those four holes in three under Thursday. The afternoon wave is still on the course, but Korda is just four off the early lead held by Madelene Sagstrom, who is seven under and currently three ahead of the next closest competitor.\n\nAsked about her round afterward, Korda called it \"solid,\" because that's all it feels like when you've won five tournaments in a row. Just solid.\n\nThursday's round came after a busy week for Korda. Over the weekend, she was there for the very first junior tournament in her name, The Nelly, down in Florida. Then she was up to New York City for the Met Gala on Monday. (When's the last time a golfer was at the Met Gala?) On Tuesday morning, she gave a press conference, as she is getting extremely accustomed to doing, and did an interview with ESPN. During her last conquest, a few weeks ago, Korda did a virtual interview with SportsCenter, but now ESPN has sent extra staffers to cover every step she takes this week.\n\nESPN+ is also providing streaming coverage of this week's event, so on a playing field much bigger than a basketball court, not a shot will be missed for those who want to see it the most. (Considering the Golf Channel is delaying showing that coverage until the evening time, ESPN+ might be the spot for you.) The pressure is ramping up, one would think. And every round adds to it. Will that get to her, eventually? We get the lovely opportunity to watch her go through that.\n\n\"I have not thought about the streak at all honestly,\" Korda said. \"I think that's only going to do more harm for me than do good. Big thing for me is taking it a shot at time and being present and in my own bubble. That's what I'm focusing on.\n\n\"I'm not trying to think about the outside noise. Would it be amazing? Of course. But it's still so far away and proud of what I've achieved so par.\"\n\nWhether or not it happens is obviously up to her, but there's only so much defense she can play. Part of it is up to a field that is growing increasingly (in awe of and) tired of losing to her. Korda is a beloved figure on the LPGA Tour, but at some point, her reign of beating everyone will end. And it might come at the hands of Sagstrom, who is in the driver's seat right now, but ask any of the ladies who have held that distinction this year and they'll tell you it doesn't mean much.\n\nLauren Coughlin led Korda by two at the Chevron Championship in April. She lost by three. Korda was well outside of the stroke play cutoff at the T-Mobile Match Play after one round in Las Vegas, but she rallied in time to pick apart the contenders in match play, slowly but surely, one at a time.

If her first-round score is any indication, she hasn't missed a beat. She fired a 69 in her first round as she attempts something no woman has ever done on the LPGA Tour: win six consecutive starts.\n\nKorda is currently sitting in a tie for fifth after the conclusion of her first round. She's three under par, while Madelene Sagstrom sits in first with seven under par. Korda is four strokes back, but she looks to be in solid shape and has plenty of time to make that up.\n\nWhile much of the golf world's attention is focused on Scottie Scheffler's impressive hot streak, he isn't even the most successful golfer in the sport right now. He's won four out of five straight starts including a Major, but Korda has won five in a row and that also includes a Major.\n\nNelly Korda opens up on first round, winning streak\n\nNelly Korda is in a decent position to contend for her sixth straight win. The World No. 1 has some ground to make up, but a four-stroke lead is hardly insurmountable for her, especially after just one round.\n\nKorda said via Sports Illustrated:\n\n\"Yeah, feels good ... overall a solid day. Didn't really make too many mistakes, and if I did -- this golf course is very, very narrow off the tee -- I kind of gave myself a good chance at par.\"\n\nShe hit four birdies in the first round but also had one bogey to put her three under for the day. Korda admitted that the win streak isn't her main concern:\n\n\"I have not thought about the streak at all, honestly. I think that's only going to do more harm for me than do good. Big thing for me is taking it a shot at time and being present and in my own bubble. That's what I'm focusing on. I'm not trying to think about the outside noise. Would it be amazing? Of course. But it's still so far away and proud of what I've achieved so far.\"\n\nOther LPGA Tour golfers have won five straight starts, but no one has ever won six. So a win at the Founders Cup would break that tie and place her firmly in the record books by herself.\n\nNelly Korda is the favorite to win according to DraftKings. She has +450 odds, which is not too far ahead of Rose Zhang (+750) and current leader Madelene Sagstrom (+900).\n\nThe final three rounds will be interesting, and the golf world will surely be watching either to see history made or to see the world's top-ranked golfer fail for the first time in a very long while.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelene_Sagstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madelene Sagstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Zhang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rose Zhang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/c10a6-17152812696694-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

(Photo: Andy Lyons/Getty Images)\n\nKorda's record in six LPGA starts this season is a staggering 507-1-20 in stroke-play events. (She also went 3-0 in the match-play portion of the T-Mobile event at Shadow Creek in Vegas.)\n\nKorda lost to 15 players at the season-opening Tournament of Champions and finished sixth in the stroke-play portion of T-Mobile after 54 holes. The top eight players advanced to match play.\n\nStrokes gained brilliance\n\nNelly Korda holds up four fingers for her fourth win in a row after winning the 2024 T-Mobile Match Play at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. (Photo: Orlando Ramirez/Getty Images)\n\nSince starting her streak at the LPGA Drive On, Korda has gained a whopping 3.60 strokes per round on the competition, according to KPMG Performance Insights. That does not include her three match-play victories in Las Vegas.\n\nFor the season, she leads the tour in strokes gained around the greens and greens in regulation, hitting 76 percent.\n\nRoom for improvement\n\nPHOENIX, ARIZONA - MARCH 31: Nelly Korda of the United States poses with the trophy after the final round of the Ford Championship presented by KCC at Seville Golf and Country Club on March 31, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. (Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images)\n\nKPMG stats guru Justin Ray broke down Korda's work on the greens, which by all accounts has been stronger this season. Even so, Ray says she has one of the lowest putt-make percentages from 5 to 10 feet on tour. She also ranks 102nd on tour in one-putts per round.\n\n\"Her ball-striking prowess is such that she easily overcomes a miscue or two per round on the greens,\" Ray wrote for LPGA.com.\n\nScoring average\n\nNelly Korda of the United States and World Golf Hall of Famer Se Ri Pak imitate a \"selfie\" with the trophy following Korda's win in the FIR HILLS SERI PAK Championship at Palos Verdes Golf Club on March 24, 2024 in Palos Verdes Estates, California. (Photo by Orlando Ramirez/Getty Images)\n\nKorda's scoring average during the streak is 68.74, and that includes some brutal weather on the West Coast and major championship conditions. She's 46 under par on the par 5s alone, dating back to the Drive On.\n\nFor the season, Korda leads the tour in par-5 scoring (4.43), par-4 scoring (3.93) and ranks 74th in par-3 scoring (3.09).\n\nSo far this season, 16 of her 26 rounds have been in the 60s, a 62 percent clip.\n\nYoungest to ...\n\nNelly Korda pretends to take a selfie with the championship trophy after a victory on the second play-off hole during the final round of the LPGA Drive On Championship at Bradenton Country Club on January 28, 2024 in Bradenton, Florida.

And at age 25, Korda became the youngest American player to win two major titles since Juli Inkster managed the feat at age 24 in 1984. Amy Alcott won two majors by age 24 in 1980.\n\nThere's much to look forward to.", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It put her in the hunt for yet another victory in 2024. As of this writing, she is tied for sixth on a stacked leaderboard.\n\nKorda is riding a five-tournament win streak, which is tied with Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam for the most ever.\n\nDespite her strong start, Korda is four shots off the leader, Madelene Sagstr\u00f6m, who fired off a 7-under 65. Nevertheless, she is in good spirits.\n\n\"I made four birdies and one bogey, so overall, a solid day,\" Korda said after her round. \"Didn't make too many mistakes, and if I did -- this golf course is very narrow off the tee -- I gave myself a good chance at par. So, I got bailed out with my short game a couple of times. Overall, it was a solid day.\"\n\nThe No. 1 player in the world had one blemish on her card at the par 4 13th when she made bogey. After that slip-up, though, she got back on track and stayed the course.\n\nAt her ninth hole, the 18th, she made her second her second birdie of the day. Korda would make two more on her back nine, including the par-5 9th, to finish her day on a high note.\n\nDespite a challenging history at this track, Korda's quest for a sixth consecutive win is off to a promising beginning. Her resilience and determination are evident as she prepares to face the Upper Montclair Country Club, a course that hasn't always been favorable to her.\n\nShe missed last year's cut after going 72-74 to finish at 2-over.\n\nHowever, this year, her five consecutive wins have all come on different types of tracks.\n\n\"You have to stay present and know you have the game to play on anything,\" she said. \"Making those four, five footers for par are big confidence boosters. You have to lean on all the stuff you have practiced and capitalize on your opportunities. Everyone is in the same boat. Everyone is playing the same golf courses every week.\"\n\nShe tends to get more aggressive as the tournament progresses each week. Yet, Korda knows when she needs to play smart golf because winning the event on Day 1 is impossible; losing it is not.\n\n\"There are still three more days... I know the weather is not supposed to be great and there is just different factors that go into the rest of the tournament,\" Korda said. \"So it's nice to get a good round in. You know, still a long, long way away from Sunday.\"\n\nShe will tee off in the afternoon wave on Friday for the second round as Korda attempts to make history and win her sixth straight LPGA Tour event.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "savannah_leigh_richardson@sbnation.com", "name": "Savannah Leigh Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_Founders_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA Founders Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelene_Sagstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madelene Sagstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Montclair_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper Montclair Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mgf0CMtus-8N7qnY1EHCbzw1vYU=/0x347:5310x3002/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440914/2152201477.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

She has the No. 1 ranking in the world, along with the 2024 lead in earnings, scoring average and points for the player of the year award.

Byron Nelson holds golf's all-time mark with 11 straight wins in 1945.\n\nThe usually reserved Korda insisted she is not thinking that far ahead, noting that can lead to a deep rabbit hole.\n\nWhile she has been off the past two weeks, Korda said she never got far away from her game, despite catching up on sleep and spending a lot of time on the couch.\n\n\"There is two sides to it,\" she said. \"Obviously when I'm home, I'm definitely practicing a lot more and trying to work on technique. When I'm out here, the way I keep it simple is by not overdoing it too much. Going out, seeing the golf course, doing my work with my caddie, picking a game plan, and then that's it.\"\n\nIn the past, Korda said she would come to events and do too much. Now she knows she has put in the work beforehand, and it's just time to execute when an event starts.\n\nThe winning streak had an unexpected benefit this week when Korda got an invitation to the Met Gala.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy,\" she said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people-watching for me. I was just silently looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda was given a number of Oscar de la Renta dresses to try on, and seemingly settled on long-sleeve gown.\n\nTwenty minutes before walking on the carpet, she had a golf moment, like when the breeze picks up before a shot to the green. The 9-iron became a pitching wedge.\n\n\"I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready,\" Korda said. \"Switched it up on everyone. It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on, wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that.\"\n\nIt was neat though, and like everything Korda has done on the golf course, it was a perfect choice.\n\n\"I thought I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala,\" Korda said. \"As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses. To be on the red carpet or green carpet was a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda has not fared well playing in New Jersey. She missed the cut in this event and the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in 2023. The Florida resident will be paired for the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 champion Minjee Lee of Australia. Lee lost in a playoff with Ko last year.\n\nHall of Famers Pat Bradley and Beth Daniel, who are here for the event that honors the 13 founding members of the LPGA Tour, feel the pressure is on Korda.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"I watched when she won the fifth in a row and she said that was the most nervous she's been down the stretch,\" Daniel said. \"I can only imagine how nerve-wracking this week is going to be.\"\n\nTags Sports Golf Clothing Games And Toys Job Market Be the first

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nShe has won five consecutive tournaments and clinched her second major title at The Chevron Championship. This past Monday, Korda even attended The Met Gala, where she walked the red carpet alongside pop culture's finest.\n\nNow, her attention shifts to the Cognizant Founders Cup, where she looks to win in her sixth straight start in historic fashion. Nobody in LPGA history -- not even Annika Sorenstam -- has accomplished that feat.\n\nBut Korda explained why another victory is likely not in the cards in her pre-tournament press conference.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about [this tournament] at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" Korda said.\n\n\"Then obviously, Monday I had The Met, so I haven't had too much time to think about it.\"\n\nIn addition, Korda has not played her best in New Jersey, which also hosted the KPMG Women's PGA Championship one year ago. Korda missed the cut at Baltusrol by six shots after totaling an 11-over score through 36 holes.\n\nShe also missed the cut at last year's Cognizant Founders Cup, which saw Jin Young Ko prevail.\n\n\"My track record hasn't been the greatest in New Jersey,\" Korda added.\n\n\"I'm really just trying to take it one shot at a time and see how it goes. This golf course is tough. It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing. And it's wet this year, so it's even worse.\"\n\nPlaying courses in the Northeast in the spring always proves challenging. Weather is always a factor, and to nobody's surprise, temperatures will hover around the low 60s this weekend in New Jersey. Friday and Sunday's forecast calls for rain, too.\n\nThat means the golf ball will not travel as far as it would in sunny and dry conditions, making it much more challenging on the field.\n\nYet, Korda cannot get herself to look too far ahead.\n\n\"I just cannot get too ahead of myself; I have to take it one shot at a time,\" Korda added.\n\n\"As boring as it sounds or as many times as you're going to hear me say it, that's the motto, and I'm going to stick to it.\"\n\nThat motto has worked so far in 2024, and she should not shy away from it this week in New Jersey.

They just deliver them.\n\nThat's what Nelly Korda has been doing the past couple months.\n\nThe 25-year-old No. 1 ranked women's golfer in the world has been delivering on a record-setting level, winning her last five tournaments -- a feat only Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam have accomplished.\n\nKorda is on a heater reminiscent to what Tiger Woods was on in his prime when he won five consecutive starts in 2007-08, six in a row in 1999-2000 and seven straight in 2006-07.\n\nHer recent accomplishments have even superseded what men's world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler has been doing, winning four of his past five tournaments, including a second Masters title.\n\nWe are fortunate to have Korda's greatness in our midst on the New York sports landscape for the next two weeks -- with this week's Cognizant Founders Cup at Upper Montclair Country Club in Clifton, N.J., and the Mizuho Americas Open being played next week at Liberty National in Jersey City.\n\nThe unfortunate element to this is that the timing is bad for Korda's visit here because of the current bender that New York sports is on. With the Knicks and Rangers playoff runs and the Yankees and Mets in the throes of their respective seasons, there's not a lot of oxygen left for women's golf in our area.\n\nThe shame is that sports fans should be lining up at Upper Montclair this week and Liberty next week to witness one of the finest runs not just a women's golfer has ever been on, but any golfer.\n\nKorda's greatness warrants more attention than it's getting, and you wonder why she hasn't been the recipient of the kind of adulation that Caitlin Clark has received for her remarkable achievements.\n\nWith all due respect to what Clark did in her incredible NCAA Tournament run and drawing attention to her sport, Korda has been doing things that the best to ever to play the game never did.\n\nHad she not been photographed on the red carpet at the Met Gala on Monday, few might have even known Korda was in town.\n\nIf she wins the Founders Cup this week, maybe that changes.\n\nKorda won her second major title and fifth consecutive victory in the Chevron Championship last month, equaling the record set by Lopez in 1978 and Sorenstam in 2004-05.\n\nA win this week would separate Korda from the tie with those two women, who happened to be two of the all-time greats in the sport.\n\n\"I'm just out here doing what I love and hopefully that's what grows the game naturally,\" Korda said Wednesday. \"I'm not trying to push anything. I hope that people see me for who I am and I love this game and doing it naturally. At the end of the day, I think if you perform well in your sport that's what grabs people's attention. I hope that I just do it naturally and that catches people's attention.\"\n\nAfter Korda coasted to the third of her five-consecutive victories at the Ford Championship last month, her swing coach, Jamie Mulligan, told reporters: \"That's what it looked like when [Woods] won. She's an athlete making a hard game look easy.\"\n\nKorda's prowess has drawn the attention of some of the best players in the men's game, not the least of whom is Scheffler.\n\n\"One of the people here asked me, 'Is this turning into a competition between you and Nelly?' And I was like, 'I don't know, man, I think if it's a competition, she's got me pretty beat right now,' '' Scheffler said after winning the RBC Heritage last month the week after capturing the Masters.\n\nKorda insisted she hasn't been fixated on winning her sixth in a row to set the record.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on these two weeks,'' she said, referring to the Met Gala.\n\nBoth Pat Bradley and Beth Daniel, two of the LPGA greats in town this week for the Founders Cup, spoke Wednesday about the pressure on Korda.\n\n\"I watched when she won the fifth in a row and she said that was the most nervous she's been down the stretch, [so] I can only imagine how nerve-wracking this week is going to be,'' Daniel said.\n\n\"Nelly is not coming in here when you least expect it,'' Bradley said. \"It is going to be a challenge for Nelly. All eyes are going to be on Nelly.''\n\nMore eyes should be on Korda.

Just a couple weeks ago, Korda captured her second major championship and won her fifth tournament in a row, tying her with Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978), who accomplished the same feat. Except, maybe it was no denouement at all. Maybe it was just the beginning.\n\nKorda attempts a record sixth consecutive victory this week at the 2024 Cognizant Founders Cup in New Jersey. It will be her first time teeing it up since winning that Chevron Championship, and she'll arrive fresh off an appearance (unusual in the world of golf) at the Met Gala.\n\nA year ago at this event, Korda missed the cut as Jin Young Ko beat Minjee Lee in a playoff after they both finished at 13 under.

It is going to be a challenge for Nelly.\"\n\nIt could benefit Korda that she is now away from the added pressure and spotlight of the year's first major.\n\n\"I'm sure she can't wait for the bell to ring and get inside those ropes and be able to focus like she does,\" added Bradley. \"But right now, it's going to be interesting.\n\n\"To see her at the Met Gala, I mean, that was exquisite. She was absolutely beautiful, and it was just -- I was just so proud to see this young lady amongst all these celebs, and she pulled it off just fabulous, like she is. She's just a very talented, wonderful young lady. What a role model that we have to take our game forward.\"\n\nIn her bid for a sixth consecutive victory on the LPGA Tour, Sorenstam finished T12 at the Michelob Ultra Open at Kingsmill. She then won three of her next four. Lopez got walloped in her bid for a fifth, which came in her rookie year in 1978. She lost big to none other than Bradley but said the experience was a great one.\n\n\"It was fun for me. I liked the pressure, and I liked the attention at a young age,\" Lopez told Golf Digest. \"I did a lot of press conferences and played a lot of golf, probably when I didn't want to. I was tired, but it was just really fun.\"\n\nKorda did not seem to be having much fun down the stretch at the Chevron Championship, so perhaps this week will be a bit lighter. Then again, if she takes it to Saturday or Sunday and is at or near the lead, the pressure will be enormous, and she will once again simply try to get across the finish line.\n\nThankfully for her, she's been pretty good at that of late.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_Founders_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LPGA Founders Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Bradley_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Bradley (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC_Match_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WGC Match Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minjee_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minjee Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/08/780e2783-4933-4bac-97ff-3a2113daeebf/thumbnail/1200x675/4ea32a830a5a4193ac3190be416d6464/nelly-korda-2024-chevron-championship.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-21", "dateEnd": "2024-03-24", "textStart": 1080, "textEnd": 1090}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-28", "dateEnd": "2024-03-31", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1145}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "dateEnd": "2024-04-07", "textStart": 1176, "textEnd": 1185}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "dateEnd": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 1218, "textEnd": 1229}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Just doing something outside of my comfort zone is definitely really cool.\n\n\"I thought, you know, I would never ever think that I would ever be able to attend the Met Gala. As a girl I watched it growing up and just in awe of all the dresses. To be on the red carpet or green carpet was a dream come true.\n\n\"It was so, so crazy. You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're star struck the entire time. It's the best people watching for me. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\n\n\"I would say like I saw Shakira and I just love Shakira. She's so beautiful. Then Jaden Smith was really, really nice. He was the first person to say hello to me and introduce himself.\n\n\"It's just, I mean, this is me. This is me, visor on wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone. It was really, really neat to step outside of my comfort zone and do something like that. That was my first time ever walking a red carpet and went out with a bang. I think it's just downhill from here.\n\n\"But it was such a neat experience and I'm just so grateful that I had the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nNow back into golf mode - Korda insists she has not thought too much about the historic six in a row she could achieve this week.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" Korda insisted.\n\n\"My track record hasn't been the greatest in New Jersey. Last year missed the cut and we played KPMG here last year too and that was a nice missed cut as well.\n\n\"I'm really just trying to keep it one shot at time, see how it goes. This golf course is tough. It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing. And it's wet this year, so it's even worse.\n\n\"So just not getting too ahead of myself and taking it a shot at a time. As boring as it sounds or as many times as you're going to hear me say it, that's the motto and I'm going to stick to it.\"\n\nKorda has been held up as a beacon for women's golf in helping to grow the game - appearing at the Met Gala as an example - but she insists she's not seeking attention just merely trying to grow the game naturally through continuing to play well on the course.\n\n\"I mean, I'm just out here doing what I love and hopefully that's what grows the game naturally,\" Korda added. \"I'm not trying to push anything. I hope that people see me for who I am and I love this game and doing it naturally.\n\n\"At the end of the day I think if you perform well in your sport that's what grabs people's attention. I'm not the type of person that tries to push anything or does anything I'm not really comfortable with.\n\n\"So I hope that I just do it naturally and that catches people's attention.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_higham@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Paul Higham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakira", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shakira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognizant", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognizant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HovrXfHndNr2gubS5nF7iT-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Korda, who dazzled at the Met Gala earlier this week in New York City, opened with a 3-under 69 at Upper Montclair Country Club and sits four back of clubhouse leader Madelene Sagstrom.\n\nLPGA legends Annika Sorenstam and Nancy Lopez join Korda as the only players to win five consecutive starts.\n\n\"The fact that she's going for six in a row and really, in my opinion, the sports media is not there enough,\" Stubbs told ESPN+ reporter Chantel McCabe. \"So we are trying to bring a little bit of press, some social ... get people to actually understand that what Nelly Korda is on the precipice of actually doing is history-making in women's golf and in women's sports.\"\n\nStubbs, who won four Grand Slam doubles titles and two mixed-doubles titles, then headed back out to watch LPGA rookie Gabriela Ruffels finish her round her own round of 69. Stubbs was coached by Ruffels' father, Ray, early in her career.\n\nKorda, the 25-year-old daughter of two world-class tennis players from the Czech Republic, notched four birdies in an opening round she deemed \"solid.\" She was especially pleased with her irons.\n\n\"This golf course is pretty intimidating off the tee,\" she said of some wayward drives that got caught in the wind.\n\nWhile Korda had a large support team at the Chevron Championship, the LPGA's first major, this week it's back to a small contingent. Her swing coach, Jamie Mulligan, is out with Patrick Cantlay at the Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. Her agent was in town briefly, but her parents didn't make the trip at all to Cliffton, New Jersey.\n\nHer physio, Kim Baughman, who keeps fruit in her backpack for Korda, who enjoyed a mid-round plum, is with her all week along with longtime caddie Jason McDede.\n\nKorda said she's not thinking about what's on the line.\n\n\"I'm not trying to think about the outside noise,\" she said. \"Would it be amazing? Of course.

But then, Korda's play of late has been historically spectacular.\n\nThis week's LPGA event, the Cognizant Founders Cup takes place just outside New York at Upper Montclair Country Club in Cliffton, New Jersey, where Korda looks to become the first player in LPGA history to win six consecutive starts.\n\nThe exclusive Met Gala - attended by celebrities such as Matt Damon, Sarah Jessica Parker, Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman, Tom Ford and Ariana Grande - is a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute and, according to vogue.com, the event raises eight-figure sums annually.\n\nThe theme for this year's gala is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" and the dress code is \"The Garden of Time.\" Live coverage of the event is being streamed on Vogue.com as well as the publication's social channels. The event is co-chaired by Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and Zendaya.\n\nNelly Korda attends the 2024 Met Gala Celebrating \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion\" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Other athletes in attendance last year included Roger Federer, Dwayne Wade, Russell Westbrook, Patrick Mahomes Olympic champion skier Eileen Gu, and WNBA player Brittany Griner, who'd been released from a Russian prison just a few months prior.\n\nThe LPGA's Korda, 25, has teed it up in six events so far in 2024 and won all but the first start at the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions. Nancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) are the only players who have previously won five consecutive starts. Should Korda win this week's event, she would join Byron Nelson, Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods as the only golfers to win six.\n\nAfter Korda won her second major title at the Chevron Championship last month, she pulled out of the next week's event in Los Angeles, citing fatigue. She had two weeks off to prepare for the Founders Cup. Before heading to New York, Korda hosted an all-girls AJGA event near her home in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nAs Korda's streak grew this spring, she was asked on several occasions how she could help the tour capitalize at a time when the popularity of women's sports has never been higher.\n\n\"I feel like for me,\" Korda said, \"the way that I promote the game is just the way I am. I'm very true to myself. I'm never going to do something I'm not really comfortable with.\"\n\nThere's no doubt the red carpet suits her.", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"},

The tour's seasonlong purse total recently crossed the $120 million mark, a steep increase from $70 million in the pre-COVID season of 2019.\n\nAll told this season, 11 non-majors on the LPGA feature purse sizes of more than $3 million, up from just five last year. Also, in 2024 the women's majors will award more than $42 million in total prize money, a number that jumped from just $23 million in 2021.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2023, the average income for top 100 LPGA players grew by 46%, from $574,000 to $841,000, the tour said. For the first time, last year three players earned $3 million or more on the course.\n\nThe LPGA also has seen a boost this season digitally. On social media, impressions are up 62% from 2023, engagements are up 65% and video views have jumped by 70%, according to data from Zoomph.\n\nThe tour's global staff is now around 225 and grew by 18% last year. On the corporate partnerships side, the LPGA signed a deal last year with Fenway Sports Management to help facilitate deals through its vast portfolio.\n\nFSM helped the LPGA sign a deal with FM Global to title sponsor a new Boston event this year. In the last 18 months, the LPGA also has partnered with well-known companies such as SeatGeek and Legends. Overall, its number of corporate partnerships are up 20% since 2021.\n\n\"The biggest benefit for us is that we as an organization, we're best prepared now more than ever to try to capitalize on an athlete's performance,\" said Matt Chmura, the LPGA's chief marketing, communications and brand officer. \"Even metrics in events that Nelly hasn't played in are significantly higher.\"\n\nWith Korda, the question has been how the LPGA will capitalize on the moment around women's golf, as well as the larger rocket ship that is women's sports as a whole. The LPGA aims to take a measured approach, Chmura said.\n\n\"There's a balance,\" he said. \"You want to maximize on the moment, but the generational greatness you're seeing, you don't want to get in the way of that. You don't want to detract from her, but how do you maximize the reach? Our team is in touch with her team almost every day.\"\n\nKorda is a marketer's dream. On top of her recent winning streak, she's No. 1 in the world and has a sponsor roster longer than some of her arrow-straight drives (see chart).\n\nBut will all of that lead to a Caitlin Clark moment for women's golf?\n\n\"I think they can, but it's going to require a unique set of circumstances all coming together at once,\" said Bill Colvin, founder of the Colvin Sports Network, who has been in golf marketing for more than 30 years. \"At the LPGA, it has to have a Megan Rapinoe moment or Serena Williams moment, where their top athletes stand up and make their case that fans and sponsors can get behind.\"\n\nThe knock against Korda by some critics is that she doesn't promote herself or the LPGA enough. But Korda has been on the cover of both Golf Digest and Golf magazine. She's been on NBC's \"Today\" twice and was on \"SportsCenter\" around the Chevron Championship. She was set to host her own American Junior Golf Association event, The Nelly Invitational, in Bradenton, Fla., from May 3-6.\n\nShe also played in the Grant Thornton Invitational, the mixed event with PGA Tour players, in the offseason, as well as the PNC Championship, both of which are on network television.\n\n\"Our athlete pool right now is incredibly strong with great personalities,\" Chmura said. \"It's probably not the same lightning bolt that Caitlin Clark had for women's basketball, but Nelly's performance recently and over her career is shining a brighter light on the tour.\"\n\nKorda is represented by Wasserman and Chris Mullhaupt, while longtime tennis agent Patricio Apey also works as an adviser for the Korda family.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbusinessjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sportsbusinessjournal.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_carpenter@sportsbusinessjournal.com", "name": "Josh Carpenter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Colvin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Colvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Sports_Management", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Sports Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federated States of Micronesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federated States of Micronesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Junior_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Junior Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Rapinoe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megan Rapinoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Don't get used to it, she says", "body": "Nelly Korda attended Monday's Met Gala in New York City.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhen Nelly Korda appeared in a red dress on the red carpet at Monday's Met Gala in New York City, it felt like validation: golf's latest, greatest star was announcing her arrival on one of the flashiest cultural stages anywhere.\n\nAccording to our own red carpet correspondent, Korda was the first pro golfer to attend the Gala since Tiger Woods more than a decade ago. That feels significant. It also feels appropriate; she's seized the attention of the golfing world with a record-tying five-tournament win streak and she's built a monstrous gap between herself and the rest of the world. Surely it's time the rest of the world should take notice. Surely it's time for her ascent to superstardom.\n\n\"It's just -- I mean, this is me,\" Korda said as she addressed the media on Wednesday ahead of the Cognizant Founders Cup in New Jersey. \"Visor on. Wearing golf clothes. This is my comfort zone.\"\n\nIt was neat, she said, stepping outside of that comfort zone. She got to choose from a selection of Oscar de la Renta dresses (she went with a last-minute wardrobe change, settling on red) and she got the first spray tan of her life (\"I couldn't show everyone my lovely permanent sock tan,\" she said) and she felt \"like a princess.\" But she also admitted she felt very small.\n\n\"I think I'm just a grain of sand in such a big, big room,\" she said. \"I was just in awe the entire night.\"\n\nIn other words, a night of glamour has not gone to Korda's head. And by Tuesday she was glad to have her feet back planted firmly on the grass.\n\nSo what do we make of this moment? Korda's Met appearance came at a fascinating time in her career and in the larger landscape of women's sports. As her win streak has rocked on, there's been a general consensus among the golf pundit class that the league needs to capitalize on her brilliance, and fast, and in a big way. They're right, of course; we watch sports for greatness, and greatness is what Korda keeps serving up. Korda's greatness has made her relevant in a broadly identifiable way, and so her sport should take full advantage, and if not now then when? There have also been exhaustive comparisons to the way women's college basketball soared to historic new heights this spring, and questions posed to Korda as to how she might help the LPGA replicate that success.\n\n\"I mean, I'm just out here doing what I love and hopefully that's what grows the game naturally,\" Korda said. \"I'm not trying to push anything. I hope that people see me for who I am and that I love this game and do it naturally.\"\n\nNaturally. That was the focal word of her press conference. It was the perfect response. Tasking Korda with PR and brand-building for an entire sport isn't really her job, after all, and it's foolish to suggest that it should be Korda's responsibility just because women's basketball has done the same. Unlike Caitlin Clark, Korda has none of the baked-in pieces that helped to make Clark so popular -- no team, no rival, no built-in fanbase, no March Madness tournament. Even though she'd never show it, you could understand if Korda is already sick of hearing the comparisons.\n\nShe returned to that word naturally in the next answer, too.\n\n\"At the end of the day I think if you perform well in your sport that's what grabs people's attention. I'm not the type of person that tries to push anything or does anything I'm not really comfortable with. So I hope that I just do it naturally and that catches people's attention,\" she said.\n\nSo what kind of person is Korda? The kind who wants it all: the pressure, the stage, the title of dominant World No. 1. The kind who's eager to chase greatness. But she's also a golf purist. She's obsessed with the process. She relishes the opportunity to work on her game at home -- after wins and even more so after losses -- and she relishes the opportunity to test that game in the arena. And lately it's been up to the task, most recently at April's Chevron Championship, where she collected the second major of her career in her record-tying fifth win in a row. She felt the toll of all-in commitment in the hours that followed.\n\n\"That first night, Sunday, I really didn't sleep much at all,\" she said. \"The adrenaline -- you actually feel really sick. You can't sleep. The adrenaline wears off and the body starts to ache a little bit. You're like, oh-kay.\"\n\nThat was a nod to the experience of winning. But post-round Korda also acknowledged that, as much as she wants her golf to do the talking, the sport needs more from the networks who carry it.\n\n\"We need a stage,\" she said post-round. \"We need to be on primetime TV, and we need to showcase the talent we have out here, which is a lot. We also need the support from not just the crowds but the television networks.\"\n\nThe tournament was an obvious success both for Korda and for the tournament as a whole, which peaked at 1.9 million viewers and had NBC Sports crowing about its most-watched iteration of the event since 2010 -- though broadcast averages were relatively flat year over year. It wasn't perfect; pace of play was notably slow, which made a day of coronation and celebration feel sluggish down the stretch. (Our James Colgan recapped the underwhelming final-round broadcast here; not enough cameras and not enough action across a sprawling golf course.)\n\nKorda's sentiment was echoed by Matt Chmura, the LPGA's chief marketing, communications and brand officer, in an interview with GOLF's Jack Hirsh. He wasn't overly keen on Clark-Korda comparisons, either, but did emphasize the lengths ESPN went to make the women's NCAA tournament feel big.\n\n\"I think you can see the investment that the broadcasters [ESPN] have made on that side, in both the production quality and the timeslots that they're on and the marketing around it. You can see the emphasis the NCAA has placed on it, and if the infrastructure is there and the elite athletes are there, there's a market for it,\" he said.\n\nThat brings us back to this week's Cognizant Founders Cup, where Korda is chasing her sixth consecutive win. There are distinct signs of progress and more ways to watch than ever -- ESPN+ has stepped up with several featured-group streams, which is a huge move that has opened up early-week coverage to the masses -- but NBC's coverage is largely restricted to streaming on Peacock and tape-delayed coverage on Golf Channel. There's no live TV coverage other than a two-hour window on CNBC Sunday afternoon.\n\nThat's not to say that Peacock can't carry significant sporting events; an average of 23 million viewers took in the Dolphins-Chiefs playoff game on that platform earlier this year -- the largest streaming-audience ever for a live sports event. But the majority of golf viewers still watch on linear TV, which makes the Founders Cup's deference to the PGA Tour's opposite-field Myrtle Beach Classic and the PGA Tour Champions' Regions Tradition (both shown live throughout the week) particularly notable.\n\nKorda continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on the course. The work comes naturally and the golf does, too; Korda has spent years in red figures. Given she began this week on a red carpet, it still feels like this moment, all its history and gravity, should feel weightier. Like \"naturally\" isn't happening as quickly as it should. Like the sports world isn't meeting the moment and that we're not all doing our jobs.\n\nBut week after week, there's no question that Korda's doing hers.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType":

Her last round above 69 was an opening-round 72 on March 21 at the Fir Hills Seri Pak Championship, which she won in a playoff for her then-second straight victory.\n\n\"Yeah, feels good ... overall a solid day,\" Korda said after a round with four birdies and one bogey. \"Didn't really make too many mistakes, and if I did -- this golf course is very, very narrow off the tee -- I kind of gave myself a good chance at par.\"\n\nKorda made two birdies on her second nine (she started on No. 10) including a birdie at the par-5 9th hole. She birdied three of the four par-5s.\n\nWith a win, the 25-year-old would become the first LPGA player to win six consecutive events. Her major title last month at the Chevron Championship was her fifth straight and tied streaks by Nancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2004-05).\n\n\"I have not thought about the streak at all, honestly,\" Korda said. \"I think that's only going to do more harm for me than do good. Big thing for me is taking it a shot at time and being present and in my own bubble. That's what I'm focusing on.\n\n\"I'm not trying to think about the outside noise. Would it be amazing? Of course.

She had short birdies on No. 2 and No. 9, both par-5s, to finish.\n\n\"There is still three more days,\" said Korda, who used her short game to save par a couple of times. \"You still have a lot of things that you -- I know the weather is not supposed to be great and there is just different factors that go into the rest of the tournament. So it's definitely nice to get a good round in. You know, still a long, long ways away from Sunday.\"\n\nKorda, who fulfilled a childhood dream by walking on the red carpet at the Met Gala on Monday, was followed during her round by about 100 fans, who politely cheered her birdies on the course roughly five miles from New York. Among the group were five women wearing black T-shirts with \"Everyone Watches Nelly Korda\" on the front.\n\nSagstrom, a Swede who shot an opening-round 63 and finished third two years ago, had six birdies, an eagle and a bogey playing in the first threesome off the back nine. She finished 10th here last year.\n\n\"This golf course first of all suits my eye really well,\" Sagstrom said. \"I've been playing around with the ball flight a little bit. My coach, Hans (Larsson), is in town. This is the third year he's here, too. We love the golf course.\"\n\nMarina Alex, a native of nearby Wayne, New Jersey, was in a group at 68, along with Jin Hee Im of South Korea and Grace Kim of Australia.\n\nKorda was tied at 69 with a large group that included Hannah Green of Australia, who won the Los Angles Open two weeks ago for her second victory on tour this year. There was no event last week so she is going for her second straight win.\n\n\"I'm still a little bit surprised I've had two wins this year, I'll be honest,\" Green said. \"Wilshire, obviously I really love it there. Singapore was a great putt on the last. I just want to keep putting myself in contention and having those moments of trying to win the trophy on Sunday.\"\n\nLee and Ruoning Yin of China, who won the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in New Jersey last year, were in a group at 2-under.

In a career which started in 1974, the Bradenton Country Club member since 2010 won four major championships and 18 LPGA Tour events. Inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2012, Stacy said what Korda has accomplished is remarkable.\n\nAnd then again, it isn't.\n\n\"She has worked so hard to come back from her (back) injury and her surgery,\" she said. \"It just shows how much she really wanted to get back, and she really got back. It's not a surprise she has done this. If someone was going to do it, Nelly was going to do it. Her power and her efficiency with her swing, and her all-around game. Her ability to get the ball in the hole.\"\n\nStacy explained further.\n\n\"She's got an all-around game,\" she said. \"Her swing is simple, she is efficient, and she has a strong short game. The putting is directly related to how you're hitting the ball. They have an expression: Pros putting for par is like dogs chasing cars. If you do that, you're doomed. She is hitting lots of greens, she is hitting lots of fairways. But if she happens to not hit the green, she still has the ability to get the ball in the hole.\n\n\"I think she is confident right now, and I think she has surrounded herself with the right people to keep her focused on what she's doing. She is not walking around with her arms straight out like a zombie. She is as normal as the day is long. But once she gets her shoes and her glove on, she stays in the moment. Right now.\"\n\nStacy said Korda's tourney winning streak is impressive given the depth of the field compared to when she played.\n\n\"The same score won,\" she said, \"but there are more people at minus-12 to minus-15. There are more people shooting that. The ladies are hitting it longer because of the equipment and the physical (training) right now.\"\n\nAnd what makes Korda's run even more impressive is they've happened on five different types of courses, in varying conditions.\n\n\"Bradenton is a Donald Ross course where the greens are wicked as hell,\" Stacy said. \"And she plays in Vegas on the Steve Wynn course where there are trees everywhere. Then she won in Phoenix when it was freezing and the course was wide open.\"\n\nWith Korda having won five straight, Stacy thinks her goals now might shift.\n\n\"It's going to be impossible for her to win every one,\" she said. \"She has important tournaments coming up. She has the (Amundi) Evian (Championship), the U.S. Women's Open, and the KPMG (Women's PGA Championship). She has won two majors. She is validating herself as we speak.\"\n\nFive weeks after having knee replacement surgery, Stacy recently shot a 1-over for nine holes at the Bradenton Country Club.\n\nPerhaps Korda touched her putter and knee.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarasota_herald_tribune@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Sarasota

It's the longest par-4 hole on the PGA Tour schedule so far this season.\n\nWith the change, players are probably going to be less likely to fly the right fairway bunker with their tee shots.\n\n\"If you could fly it 320 [yards], that fairway is double the size, and you're hitting way less club in,\" two-time Wells Fargo Championship winner Max Homa said. \"So you could swing way harder and be kind of bailed out left and right a little bit. Now, it's like I don't think anybody can fly it. I say that and Wyndham will probably carry it.\"\n\nHoma said he isn't a fan of lengthening holes, but it probably needed to be done on No. 16.\n\n\"If you hit the ball far, that's a massive skill, but it felt like you were getting an enormous reward for about five to seven percent of the field,\" Homa said. \"I think it makes it a little bit better.\"\n\nSince 2003, the Green Mile has been ranked the hardest three-hole finishing stretch on tour with an average of +0.89 over par. Holes 16-18 have accounted for 24.1% of bogeys, 38.7% of doubles and 51.5% of triples or worse during the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nAfter taking a two-week break after capturing her second major championship at the Chevron Championship on April 21, Korda is back in action.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" Korda said. \"I'm really just trying to keep it one shot at a time, see how it goes. This golf course is tough. It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing.\"\n\nLast year, in her first start at Upper Montclair Country Club, Korda carded 72-74 and missed the cut. She also missed the cut at the 2023 KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey.\n\nKorda will play the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko and Australia's Minjee Lee.\n\n\"Obviously, with the weather they've had it's a little bit more wet compared to last year,\" Korda said. \"Last year was my first year playing and it was super firm, so a little different from last year. I think you can be a bit more aggressive this year. My track record isn't great in New Jersey, so I'm hoping to change that this year.\"\n\nNelly at Met Gala\n\nOn Monday, Korda attended the annual Met Gala at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She's among a handful of athletes who had been invited to the event -- tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams also were at this week's fundraiser.\n\n\"Gosh, it was so, so crazy,\" Korda said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet, and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies, and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people watching for me. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda said she saw Shakira, one of her favorite singers, and the rapper and actor Jaden Smith, who stopped and said hello.\n\n\"Everyone was really amazing,\" Korda said. \"I can't just point out one person. The dresses were unbelievable and the whole evening was just a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda wore a floral Oscar de la Renta gown on the red carpet. She was a guest of Casey Wasserman, chairman and CEO of the Wasserman entertainment and sports agency.\n\n\"I got a couple dresses to try on from Oscar de la Renta, and they were all so stunning,\" Korda said. \"It was so hard to decide. I actually switched it up last minute, probably like 20 minutes before I started to get ready, and I had to completely change my entire look. I was going to go with a long sleeve gown so I was going to have my hair up.\n\n\"Then I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready. Switched it up on everyone.\"\n\nShaw hoping to inspire others\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old from Litchfield Park, Arizona, is making her LPGA Tour debut after winning the John Shippen Cognizant Cup by 2 strokes Monday. The John Shippen events work to provide playing opportunities to top Black amateurs and pros.\n\nJohn Shippen Jr. was the first American-born golf professional and the country's first Black golf professional.\n\n\"I am extremely excited to be a part of the change and bringing more diversity to the game of golf,\" Shaw said. \"The game of golf, it doesn't have a lot of people who look like myself, and even just women in the game who stick with it.\n\n\"So being a part of events like the John Shippen, it brings kind of a closer-to-home type feel. When I play in the events I play in I'm usually the only one who looks like me -- most of the time. It's maybe two other people out there.\"\n\nShaw also competes on the Underrated Tour, which is supported by NBA star Stephen Curry and LPGA player Mariah Stackhouse.\n\nShaw says she hopes to inspire other young Black female golfers this week.\n\n\"I definitely hope that they see that when they have a dream, that if they stick to it and work hard they can achieve it,\" she said.", "source":

It's less clear that people who aren't already women's golf fans are tuning in. TV viewership for that last event, a major, was basically flat from the year prior.\n\nBeyond mere excellence, Korda has a lot in common with newly minted No. 1 WNBA draftee Caitlin Clark. While Clark plays an electric style of basketball that translates perfectly to a vertical video app, Korda has the most impressive swing in golf. For years, her move to the ball has been Instagram and YouTube catnip for golfers of all genders, a once-in-a-generation mix of relaxed tempo, flexibility, and speed. Korda, just 25, is a sought-after pitchwoman just like Clark. Both have lengthy lists of blue-chip sponsors. They have shared at least one: Goldman Sachs, which put Clark in a commercial during the 2023 NCAA tournament and has its name on Korda's visor as she plays. Both players have seen their fame and performance hit a crescendo lately, but both have been huge figures in their sport since 2021, the year Clark wrapped her freshman season at Iowa and Korda reached No. 1 in the world and won Olympic gold.\n\nWhere the comparison ends is that every American sports fan (and beyond) knows Clark, but most do not know Korda. The reasons for that discrepancy are outside the golfer's control. Korda plays a sport that isn't naturally given to making her a huge deal outside its walls, and those walls are high. Golf is an inconvenient and expensive game to play, and the women's pro game is a hard one to find, as a spectator. Korda is also dominant in a moment when it's not clear how much dominance sells. She will win many more tournaments, but it remains to be seen if she can elevate something that doesn't want to be elevated. If not, you can at least make yourself a more fulfilled sports fan by finding her rounds and watching them.\n\nThe story of Clark's cultural preeminence this spring has also been the story of women's basketball's rise. The star player and the rest of the sport were good for each other. Clark was undeniably compelling, and she came around at a time when the sport's popularity was growing and when NCAA economics were shifting in women's favor. The embrace of the sport by media companies was key, as several Clark games got network TV placement. Seeing the rising tide, ESPN marshaled its agenda-setting ability to drive more attention to the sport and the player. That meant everything from putting together a robust studio crew to having big names like Stephen A. Smith debate Clark's legacy in real time.\n\nNone of that is happening in women's golf. NBC aired the last few hours of the action on Saturday and Sunday, as Korda wrapped her fifth straight win. But most of her rounds are on Golf Channel or a streaming product, and many tournaments don't make it onto network TV at all. (The standard for men's tournaments is cable and streaming on Thursday and Friday, then network on long weekend afternoons.) This weekend, as Korda tries for her sixth win in a row, all four rounds are not just relegated to cable but to a tape delay, airing in the evenings while a (men's) PGA Tour event takes the slot during the day. Otherwise the only way to watch her will be on ESPN+, the Disney service that has just 25 million subscribers, about 100 million fewer than the number of households that have network television. The rest of the golfing press has by no means ignored Korda. She is a conversation topic all the time in a bunch of golf magazines and podcasts, and she is all over TaylorMade's equipment advertising. But that is just the thing: Golf fans are well acquainted with her. Generalist sports fans are not.\n\n\"We need a stage,\" Korda said after her last win. \"We need to be on prime-time TV.\" Eventually, the sport should get bigger support from networks. Any media executive with any familiarity with recent trends in the sports business should be interested in taking more of a stab at women's golf. The best way to showcase Korda is simply to have more people watch her play golf, and at the moment, the suits are not helping.\n\nAnd even when that changes, a TV network won't do the job alone. Golf is the favorite sport of 1 percent of the country, which is different from being the 1 percent's favorite sport, but only so much. All due respect to the people working hard to make the game accessible to more people, but golf is also on the shortlist of Earth's least progressive sports. It is a country club game steeped in conservative tradition and politics. That materializes in different ways at different times. Lately, you may have noticed the Saudi Arabian government attempting to lease the federal government's executive branch from 2025 to 2028 by holding golf tournaments at Trump courses.\n\nGolf is far from the only sport to have some cold, hard commercial arrangements. But it might be the least inclined to rally support for women's competition in a way that has mainstream appeal. In soccer, the growth of the U.S. women's national team into a cultural behemoth has been partly down to how great the team has been. But the USWNT has also positioned itself as a cause worth supporting -- in a fight with the national federation and for LGBTQ+ inclusion and women's rights. College basketball is somewhat similar. The caliber of play is excellent, some of the schools have rabid fanbases built in, and watching the sport fits with a belief that women's sports have gotten short shrift over the decades and deserve a chance to shine. The second-class treatment of the women's tournament not only made the NCAA look foolish but offered up a wrong for sponsors, fans, and media partners to right.\n\nIn basketball, mass uproar ensued after social media posts revealed a weight-room disparity between men and women at a tournament site. Golf allows far bigger, more structural inequities to pass by year after year. The Masters, the most prestigious tournament in the sport, does not feature a women's professional competition. Augusta National Golf Club didn't have a woman in its membership until 2012, and it only began staging an amateur women's event -- but still not a pro one -- in 2019. The gap is akin to the NCAA not holding a women's hoops tournament until 1982, when it did so at Title IX's gunpoint.\n\nProfessional golf makes its own rules, and there is no public groundswell to force the ritziest governing body in the sport to change its tack. Augusta would probably cite scheduling difficulties as a reason why it doesn't. (The course is only in top shape for a few months a year.) But that course should want a women's professional tournament, as its leadership frets about the best men's players hitting the ball farther than Augusta's course design was meant to handle. The Masters is just one weekend a year, but it is indicative of what the women don't have. To understate matters, \"the Chevron Championship\" simply does not have the same ring, nor does it get as much media coverage as a woman's major at the most iconic venue in the sport would get.\n\nMaking golf into the site of a feminist push is tricky given the sport's conservative traditions, golf's general resemblance to the Republican National Committee, and the women's game's corporate partners. Just this year, the LPGA explored a merger with its European counterpart. The deal didn't go through because the Saudi energy giant Aramco, a major financial backer of the European tour and the organizer of events that American stars play in, didn't want it to happen. What's a sport to do when its nation-state benefactor throws up a roadblock to putting the best possible product on the course?\n\nNone of those limitations are Korda's doing. Her domination has, in fact, been downright Woodsian, and there is nothing that captures attention in golf quite like that.\n\nBut golf may also be learning right now that a singular dominant star who isn't named Tiger only moves the needle so much. On the men's side, Scottie Scheffler is amid an utterly brilliant run in which he's making a mockery of his competition. People still did not seem interested in watching the Masters, even though it had the ideal cocktail of the world's No. 1 player going for a victory on Sunday and a competitive leaderboard with stars who had a chance to beat him. None did, just as nobody can touch Korda.\n\nFor now, Korda will have to keep being otherworldly on channels most people don't watch and on the phones of people who are already obsessed with golf. Right now, she could beat any competitor on the planet. But she cannot beat gravity and undo decades of golf's collective decisionmaking on her own.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kirshner@slate.com", "name": "Alex Kirshner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_Founders_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA Founders Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaylorMade", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TaylorMade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

(AP) -- Nelly Korda put herself in position for a record sixth straight win on the LPGA Tour, shooting a relatively mistake-free 3-under 69 in the first round of the Cognizant Founders Cup on Thursday.\n\nThe round of four birdies and a bogey on the Upper Montclair Country Club left the 25-year-old American four shots behind early leader Madelene Sagstrom, who had a 65 on a course she loves.\n\nTeeing off just before 8 a.m. EDT on the back nine with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 titlist Minjee Lee of Australia, Korda didn't do much for the first eight holes and only seemed to get going when she rolled in a 10-foot birdie on her ninth hole to get to 1 under. She had short birdies on No. 2 and No. 9, both par-5s, to finish.\n\n\"There is still three more days,\" said Korda, who used her short game to save par a couple of times. \"You still have a lot of things that you -- I know the weather is not supposed to be great and there is just different factors that go into the rest of the tournament. So it's definitely nice to get a good round in. You know, still a long, long ways away from Sunday.\"\n\nKorda, who fulfilled a childhood dream by walking on the red carpet at the Met Gala on Monday, was followed during her round by about 100 fans, who politely cheered her birdies on the course roughly five miles from New York. Among the group were five women wearing black T-shirts with \"Everyone Watches Nelly Korda\" on the front.\n\nSagstrom, a Swede who shot an opening-round 63 and finished third two years ago, had six birdies, an eagle and a bogey playing in the first threesome off the back nine. She finished 10th here last year.\n\n\"This golf course first of all suits my eye really well,\" Sagstrom said. \"I've been playing around with the ball flight a little bit. My coach, Hans (Larsson), is in town. This is the third year he's here, too. We love the golf course.\"\n\nMarina Alex, a native of nearby Wayne, New Jersey, was in a group at 68, along with Jin Hee Im of South Korea and Grace Kim of Australia.\n\nKorda was tied at 69 with a large group that included Hannah Green of Australia, who won the Los Angles Open two weeks ago for her second victory on tour this year. There was no event last week so she is going for her second straight win.\n\n\"I'm still a little bit surprised I've had two wins this year, I'll be honest,\" Green said. \"Wilshire, obviously I really love it there. Singapore was a great putt on the last. I just want to keep putting myself in contention and having those moments of trying to win the trophy on Sunday.\"\n\nLee and Ruoning Yin of China, who won the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in New Jersey last year, were in a group at 2-under.

After winning at Quail Hollow last year, he picked up victories at the U.S. Open at Los Angeles Country Club and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in February.\n\nClark is now ranked No. 3 in the world, behind Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy.\n\n\"Yeah, it's crazy,\" Clark said. \"I mean, in 12 months, it's crazy to think I jumped that many spots and have a few wins under my belt now. It's honestly really humbling and fun to be in this position. I'm just really looking to continue to grow and get better. I like to think this is just the beginning, and hopefully it's the start of a lot of really good golf in the future years.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Clark took a scouting trip to Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, where he'll defend his U.S. Open title on June 13-16.\n\nSimpson OK with exemptions\n\nWebb Simpson has heard some of the criticism about him and other PGA Tour policy board members receiving sponsors' exemptions into tournaments. While acknowledging that they are the \"most coveted sponsor exemptions in the history of the Tour\" because of $20 million purses at signature events, Simpson said he is satisfied with how they've been distributed so far.\n\nSimpson is playing on a sponsor's exemption this week -- he is a longtime resident and member of Quail Hollow Club.\n\n\"These tournament directors are working round the clock for a year trying to make their tournament the best,\" Simpson said. \"I know that this is my fourth sponsor exemption, and Adam Scott's received his fair share. There was controversy and guys were trying to link us being on the board, but it has nothing to do with me being on the board.\"\n\nSimpson, whose eight worldwide victories include the 2012 U.S. Open, said his track record and familiarity with tournament directors has more to do with getting the exemptions.\n\n\"I certainly think the criticisms, I knew they were going to come depending on who got them, but I'm very comfortable knowing that we've given the sponsors the opportunity to pick, and the tournament directors,\" Simpson said.\n\nPGA Tour chief competitions officer Tyler Dennis said Wednesday that the policy board would evaluate sponsor's exemptions at a meeting this summer.\n\nChanges to the \"Green Mile\"\n\nQuail Hollow club lengthened the par-4 16th hole -- the start of the fabled \"Green Mile\" three-hole finishing stretch. At 529 yards on the card, No. 16 is tied for the second-longest par 4 on tour this season. It's the longest par-4 hole on the PGA Tour schedule so far this season.\n\nWith the change, players are probably going to be less likely to fly the right fairway bunker with their tee shots.\n\n\"If you could fly it 320 [yards], that fairway is double the size, and you're hitting way less club in,\" two-time Wells Fargo Championship winner Max Homa said. \"So you could swing way harder and be kind of bailed out left and right a little bit. Now, it's like I don't think anybody can fly it. I say that and Wyndham will probably carry it.\"\n\nHoma said he isn't a fan of lengthening holes, but it probably needed to be done on No. 16.\n\n\"If you hit the ball far, that's a massive skill, but it felt like you were getting an enormous reward for about five to seven percent of the field,\" Homa said. \"I think it makes it a little bit better.\"\n\nSince 2003, the Green Mile has been ranked the hardest three-hole finishing stretch on tour with an average of +0.89 over par. Holes 16-18 have accounted for 24.1% of bogeys, 38.7% of doubles and 51.5% of triples or worse during the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nAfter taking a two-week break after capturing her second major championship at the Chevron Championship on April 21, Korda is back in action.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" Korda said. \"I'm really just trying to keep it one shot at a time, see how it goes. This golf course is tough. It's very, very narrow off the tee. The rough is very penalizing.\"\n\nLast year, in her first start at Upper Montclair Country Club, Korda carded 72-74 and missed the cut. She also missed the cut at the 2023 KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey.\n\nKorda will play the first two rounds with defending champion Jin Young Ko and Australia's Minjee Lee.\n\n\"Obviously, with the weather they've had it's a little bit more wet compared to last year,\" Korda said. \"Last year was my first year playing and it was super firm, so a little different from last year. I think you can be a bit more aggressive this year. My track record isn't great in New Jersey, so I'm hoping to change that this year.\"\n\nNelly at Met Gala\n\nOn Monday, Korda attended the annual Met Gala at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She's among a handful of athletes who had been invited to the event -- tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams also were at this week's fundraiser.\n\n\"Gosh, it was so, so crazy,\" Korda said. \"You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet, and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies, and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people watching for me. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda said she saw Shakira, one of her favorite singers, and the rapper and actor Jaden Smith, who stopped and said hello.\n\n\"Everyone was really amazing,\" Korda said. \"I can't just point out one person. The dresses were unbelievable and the whole evening was just a dream come true.\"\n\nKorda wore a floral Oscar de la Renta gown on the red carpet. She was a guest of Casey Wasserman, chairman and CEO of the Wasserman entertainment and sports agency.\n\n\"I got a couple dresses to try on from Oscar de la Renta, and they were all so stunning,\" Korda said. \"It was so hard to decide. I actually switched it up last minute, probably like 20 minutes before I started to get ready, and I had to completely change my entire look. I was going to go with a long sleeve gown so I was going to have my hair up.\n\n\"Then I saw this amazing red dress and I just changed my entire look probably 20 minutes before I started to get ready. Switched it up on everyone.\"\n\nShaw hoping to inspire others\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old from Litchfield Park, Arizona, is making her LPGA Tour debut after winning the John Shippen Cognizant Cup by 2 strokes Monday. The John Shippen events work to provide playing opportunities to top Black amateurs and pros.\n\nJohn Shippen Jr. was the first American-born golf professional and the country's first Black golf professional.\n\n\"I am extremely excited to be a part of the change and bringing more diversity to the game of golf,\" Shaw said. \"The game of golf, it doesn't have a lot of people who look like myself, and even just women in the game who stick with it.\n\n\"So being a part of events like the John Shippen, it brings kind of a closer-to-home type feel. When I play in the events I play in I'm usually the only one who looks like me -- most of the time. It's maybe two other people out there.\"\n\nShaw also competes on the Underrated Tour, which is supported by NBA star Stephen Curry and LPGA player Mariah Stackhouse.\n\nShaw says she hopes to inspire other young Black female golfers this week.\n\n\"I definitely hope that they see that when they have a dream, that if they stick to it and work hard they can achieve it,\" she said.", "source":

(AP) -- Nelly Korda put herself in position for a record sixth straight win on the LPGA Tour, shooting a relatively mistake-free 3-under 69 in the first round of the Cognizant Founders Cup on Thursday.\n\nThe round of four birdies and a bogey on the Upper Montclair Country Club left the 25-year-old American four shots behind early leader Madelene Sagstrom, who had a 65 on a course she loves.\n\nTeeing off just before 8 a.m. EDT on the back nine with defending champion Jin Young Ko of South Korea and 2022 titlist Minjee Lee of Australia, Korda didn't do much for the first eight holes and only seemed to get going when she rolled in a 10-foot birdie on her ninth hole to get to 1 under. She had short birdies on No. 2 and No. 9, both par-5s, to finish.\n\n\"There is still three more days,\" said Korda, who used her short game to save par a couple of times. \"You still have a lot of things that you -- I know the weather is not supposed to be great and there is just different factors that go into the rest of the tournament. So it's definitely nice to get a good round in. You know, still a long, long ways away from Sunday.\"\n\nKorda, who fulfilled a childhood dream by walking on the red carpet at the Met Gala on Monday, was followed during her round by about 100 fans, who politely cheered her birdies on the course roughly five miles from New York. Among the group were five women wearing black T-shirts with \"Everyone Watches Nelly Korda\" on the front.\n\nSagstrom, a Swede who shot an opening-round 63 and finished third two years ago, had six birdies, an eagle and a bogey playing in the first threesome off the back nine. She finished 10th here last year.\n\n\"This golf course first of all suits my eye really well,\" Sagstrom said. \"I've been playing around with the ball flight a little bit. My coach, Hans (Larsson), is in town. This is the third year he's here, too. We love the golf course.\"\n\nMarina Alex, a native of nearby Wayne, New Jersey, was in a group at 68, along with Jin Hee Im of South Korea and Grace Kim of Australia.\n\nKorda was tied at 69 with a large group that included Hannah Green of Australia, who won the Los Angles Open two weeks ago for her second victory on tour this year. There was no event last week so she is going for her second straight win.\n\n\"I'm still a little bit surprised I've had two wins this year, I'll be honest,\" Green said. \"Wilshire, obviously I really love it there. Singapore was a great putt on the last. I just want to keep putting myself in contention and having those moments of trying to win the trophy on Sunday.\"\n\nLee and Ruoning Yin of China, who won the Women's PGA Championship at Baltusrol in New Jersey last year, were in a group at 2-under.

Mandatory Credit: Thomas Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nNelly Korda's recent success has turned her into a megastar. Her five consecutive victories have already cemented her status as an LPGA legend. However, the 25-year-old has also been gaining stardom outside the golf course. Recently, she was spotted at New York's Met Gala becoming the first female golfer to walk the Met Gala carpet. She matched the unique feat of legendary Tiger Woods who was the first golfer to be invited to the fashion's biggest night in 2013.\n\nThe New York's Met Gala is organized annually to raise funds for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. While most of the big-names come from the entertainment, fashion, and business industries, Korda was invited by Anna Wintour's fashion agency's chairperson Casey Wasserman.\n\nKorda adorned a red poppy-covered dress with green stems designed by Oscar de le Renta. Moreover, the World No. 1 golfer was not just the only sportsperson at the famous fashion night. Tennis titan Serena Williams, NBA Star Ben Simmons, NFL star Odell Becham Jr., and WNBA icon Angel Reese marked their presence at the Met Gala as well.\n\nInterestingly, Korda became the second golfer after Tiger Woods to be invited to the Met Gala. The Ace golfer walked on the famous red carpet back in 2013.\n\nThe 15-time major champion attended the Met Gala back in 2013 with his ex-girlfriend, the famous American alpine ski racer, Lindsey Vonn. They were labeled as the power couple walking the carpet at a prestigious fashion night. It was a night of glamor and glitz and as the couple made their way through things were quite smooth, until just before the couple were to leave. An unknown insider source reported that \"Tiger looked uncomfortable\" as he walked alongside Vonn.\n\nAs per a Daily News article, Woods and Vonn checked out the city's skyline and later sat down for drinks. But eventually got involved in some sort of PDA. Later on, the golfer got up and started dancing awkwardly before Woods reportedly slipped off some stairs. Before any anyone could see them, Vonn helped him exit safely at around 2 AM.\n\nWoods and Vonn eventually broke up in 2015 citing incompatibility in their schedules. For now, the golf legend is concentrating on getting back in the game after his last-place finish at The Masters.\n\nNelly Korda has taken a break from professional golf and will be returning soon with the same zeal.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kunal_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Kunal Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woodlands,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Woodlands, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Woodlands, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Vonn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Vonn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Wasserman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casey Wasserman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Wintour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anna Wintour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/35909b88-untitled-design-2024-04-21t001836.785.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

I'm pumped about the fact that we're just one week out from the PGA Championship and the Mizuho Americas Open, which I will be attending at Liberty National.\n\nRemember four weeks ago, when the golf world was buzzing over the fact that Scottie Scheffler might withdraw from the Masters if his wife Meredith went into labor? Well, we're a few days away from continuing that storyline into the second men's major of the year. Scheffler isn't teeing it up at the Wells Fargo this week as they await the birth of their firstborn, but wow, this is a highly anticipated birth in the golf world. I'm looking forward to all the tweets about Scottie's new perspective as a father in the coming weeks.\n\nOkay, enough about that. Let's get to the BIG news of the day.\n\nWithout Blake Lively and Taylor Swift at the Met Gala last night, the event needed a new hero. And you know who perfectly fit the bill? World No. 1 Nelly Korda. I had no idea that Korda was attending, so you can imagine my surprise when I saw one of my favorite golfers pop up on Getty Images as I scrolled through photos from the night. I've said it before and I'll say it again. One of the biggest perks of working in golf is the access to Getty Images, and not just during tournaments! I scroll through Getty during the Super Bowl, after concerts and of course throughout the Met Gala.\n\nOkay, back to Korda. She was there as a guest of Casey Wasserman and wore Oscar de la Renta's red poppy appliqu\u00e9 dress.\n\nWe've gotten used to seeing movie stars and musicians at the Met Gala, but Korda is just the second professional golfer to attend the event (and the first LPGA player)! Tiger attended it with Lindsey Vonn back in 2013.\n\nAlso, shout out to Korda for getting an early-morning nine in to prep for the Founders Cup the morning of the Gala.\n\nThe grind never stops!\n\nSpeaking of galas, Tony and Layna Finau hosted one of their own over the weekend at Blue Sky Ranch in Utah. This was the third annual Tony Finau Foundation Gala, which raised money for the foundation's primary pillars -- literacy, basic needs and mental health.\n\nLayna Finau made sure her husband had a new suit for the occasion, and that it matched his shoes.\n\nThe Finaus have had a great two weeks. They attended Patrick Mahomes' \"15 and Mahomies\" event in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, where they met Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.\n\nThe Tony Finau Foundation Gala had some big names in attendance as well, including Dwyane Wade, Bones Mackay and singer Brett Young, who performed at the event.\n\nBones and Dwyane Wade! How about that? I'd love to know what these guys all talked about.\n\nI'm desperate to know what big event Layna and Tony Finau will be attending next.\n\nAnd finally, I'll leave you all with the best photo I've seen on the internet in a very long time: Adam Hadwin enjoying his dinner while his daughter Maddox does her thing.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(Adele_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hello (Adele song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Flames_and_Lady_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty Flames and Lady Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bones (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Hadwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Hadwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Vonn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Vonn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/RR.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Here's who can help her get one", "body": "Nelly Korda had just won her second major title, her fifth LPGA event in a row, and she was starting to get those same old questions again.\n\nWhat is it going to take to elevate women's golf? How can we get more people to watch the LPGA? When are more people going to come to your events?\n\nShe had answered these types of questions earlier that week in The Woodlands, Texas, and her answer remained the same days later.\n\n\"We need a stage,\" Korda said. \"We need to be on primetime TV, and we need to showcase the talent we have out here, which is a lot. We also need the support from not just the crowds but the television networks.\"\n\nHer callout of TV networks was well-received by fans after a fairly mediocre NBC final-round broadcast of the Chevron Championship, which seemed understaffed and was unable to fully engage viewers with graphics and storylines.\n\nYet it's hard to look at the way Korda has performed in 2024, winning all but one of her six starts and grabbing a stranglehold on the top spot in women's golf, and not draw comparisons to what Caitlin Clark did over the past four seasons for women's basketball.\n\nClark, who just finished her career at Iowa, rewrote record books for scoring and assists for both men's and women's college basketball players. Behind a renewed marketing push from NCAA broadcast partner ESPN, Clark's final appearance in the women's NCAA title game drew 18.9 million viewers, the most for a basketball game at any level since 2019 and marking the first time ever the women's championship game bested the men's.\n\nThe final round of the Chevron drew just 936,000 viewers on NBC, even less than it did a year ago. Despite the PGA Tour's RBC Heritage in a rain delay for much of the broadcast window on CBS that day, more than twice as many people still tuned in to that broadcast.\n\nOn the grounds at Carlton Woods, the people were out to see Korda make history. With the win, she became just the third LPGA player ever to win five events in a row. There was more of a buzz on-site; LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan told a group of reporters while walking down the 8th fairway that it may have been the best crowd at a domestic LPGA event since she took over as commissioner three years ago.\n\nBut there is still work to be done, and if there's anyone who heard Korda's call for a stage loud and clear, it's Matt Chmura.\n\nChmura is the LPGA's chief marketing, communications and brand officer, and he's still just two years into the job. At the Chevron, Chmura sat down with GOLF.com to discuss what the LPGA is doing to capitalize on Korda's play -- she goes for her sixth straight win this week -- what the league has learned, where it's going, how it can get more eyeballs on the women's game and more.\n\n(Ed. note: This Q and A has been lightly edited for length and clarity.)\n\nJack Hirsh: So I understand your role is somewhat new to the LPGA. How so?\n\nMatt Chmura: Yeah, it's a role that, Mollie [Marcoux Samaan], our commissioner, kind of created and I don't want to confuse things, because there were a lot of people doing some functions of marketing in the organization, but it was never kind of built out in a robust way. Not marketing per se, like we had people in creative. We had people in broadcast. We had some people in content. We had comms, but what we've really tried to do is create a contemporary marketing department.\n\nIt has four verticals within it: communications, broadcast content, marketing and then business intelligence.\n\nA lot of my time in the first 20 months was kind of understanding our business, learning our business. Like seeing where the shortfalls were and then kind of developing the strategy to kind of lift where we are.\n\nYou just listed off four different verticals. What would you like to do that if or when you leave this role, you'd feel successful?\n\nI think it's like doing the foundational work and setting the infrastructure in place that anybody in the group and anybody on the team can leave and the Tour is in a good place to keep the momentum. Our athletes deserve the best and they deserve to have the proper infrastructure in place that can create that commercial value for them to drive toward equity and for us to drive toward equity. And you can't skip steps along the way. Like our website. We are redoing our website and our app right now. It's a massive investment for the tour. It's something that hasn't been done in almost a decade.\n\nYou mentioned leaving the LPGA in a good place. Do you think it's in a good place now?\n\nYeah, I mean when you look at how much purses have grown from 2021 to now, it's significant. I think we have a lot of work to be done across all areas of our business, and I think that we're constantly striving to get better. And I think that we're uber-focused on doing those foundational things. And then once we get that done, then I keep driving for better for our athletes. That to me is one of the coolest parts of what we're doing because of the business structure of our entity, like the money that comes in through the commercial value that we create is going right to our athletes.\n\nIt's no secret what's going on in women's sports with women's basketball and Caitlin Clark. What goes through your head when you see the NCAA Women's National Championship outrate the men's title game?\n\nIt doesn't matter if they're male or they're female or what sport they play, elite athletes are elite athletes, and I think people want to watch elite athletes. And that's what our players are, is elite athletes. And I think you can see the investment that the broadcasters [ESPN] have made on that side, in both the production quality and the timeslots that they're on and the marketing around it. You can see the emphasis the NCAA has placed on it, and if the infrastructure is there and the elite athletes are there, there's a market for it.\n\nWhat do you have to do to get Nelly Korda the stage she wants?\n\nIt goes into a lot of the work that we're doing. It's having the right digital platforms, having the right ways to reach all the different fans wherever they consume content. And so some of them are going to consume NBC/Golf Channel. Some of them are going to consume ESPN+. Some of them are going to consume our social channels. Some of them are going to consume content that's on our web and our app. It's getting all of those properties, maximizing the potential that we have in those properties and then letting our athletes perform. I think the stage is through all of those.\n\nWhat we have to do is provide content on each one of those channels that's compelling of our athletes, so that every different fan can consume the great play of our athletes through the channel they prefer. And I think for us, that's a big focus is providing that stage. I think she's spot on.\n\nKorda has won four times this season, but only $1.2 million in prize money (she doubled that by winning the Chevron for her fifth straight win). That's just a third of what Scottie Scheffler got for winning the Masters. How do we get closer to equal pay across genders?\n\nIt's one thing to ask for equity. And certainly, we want equity, but we have to do our jobs to continue to provide that commercial value for brands. When you're sitting in there saying, \"We have X amount of money to spend on marketing, the LPGA is just as good of option as their male counterparts.\" And so we need to drive towards that.\n\nIt was reported the LPGA is now working with Naomi Osaka's media company, Hana Kuma. What does that partnership entail?\n\nOur athletes are so focused on what happens on the golf course, as they should be. But we know we need to help them with social presence, and they don't necessarily have the teams that some of their male counterparts do to help them with that. And so, the Hana Kuma team has been a great partner so far. Again, like on my side of the business, we have SeatGeek, who's handling our tickets. We have Aspire who's selling our tickets. We have a company actually out selling tickets. The LPGA has never had that.\n\nAnd so Hana Kuma is running two different kind of sides of a program for us. We've picked eight athletes (the names will be unveiled at a later date) that have been hand-selected that wanted to do that. They're going to engage with Hana Kuma on really developing their social presence and better understanding all that goes into social media. The other part is that they're running a program for all of our athletes who want to be involved, to just teach them more about social media and what's effective and what is better for them and how they can lean into it and how they should use it.\n\nOur athletes aren't team sport athletes who sign a five-year deal. They have to perform to stay here week in, week out. So they're laser-focused on what happens between the ropes. And so our job is to provide them as many tools as we can to help them be successful outside the ropes.\n\nWhen you have an athlete like Nelly who's won four (now five) in a row, does that make your job easier?\n\nWe're witnessing generational greatness and I think that's a good thing, obviously. But we have a lot of stars and elite athletes on this tour, so I think putting that pressure on Nelly is unfair, or suggesting that she is the one that needs to lift our tour up. This isn't one person. It's a collective effort. It's the collection of athletes that are out here, that are elite, that stare each other down every week.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [],

I feel like I lived out a little girl dream of mine,\" Korda, 25, said on Wednesday in Clifton, N.J. \"Gosh, it was so, so crazy. You're standing in line ready to get on the carpet and you're like seeing all these people you usually watch in TV shows or movies and they're like famous singers and you're starstruck the entire time. It's the best people watching for me. I was just silent looking at everyone's dresses.\"\n\nKorda has put away the Oscar de la Renta gown she wore for her more customary visor and golf clothes to compete this week at the Cognizant Founders Cup starting Thursday at Upper Montclair County Club.\n\nIt's her first tournament since her LPGA record-tying victory -- and second major title -- at the Chevron Championship on April 21 in The Woodlands, Texas. She joined Hall of Famers Annika Sorenstam (2004-05) and Nancy Lopez (1978) as the only players in LPGA Tour history to win five straight starts.\n\nKorda played 25 holes on the final day to make up for a weather delay on Saturday on her way to winning her 13th LPGA Tour event. She was able to stay in the moment and make clutch shots down the stretch.\n\n\"I feel like every time I do learn more about myself and I can lean on what I've practiced on and I can lean on the situations that I've been through to help me through that and to really take it a shot at a time,\" Korda said Wednesday.\n\n\"Getting ahead of yourself is just going to lead you down a bad, bad rabbit hole. We made sure we were very, very present coming down the stretch. Even if I had a five-shot lead I was still going to be very nervous.\n\n\"To be very present during that time really helped me to soak in the entire moment as well.\" It could apply to her Monday evening in New York City, and to her approach to the possibility of a record-breaking result this weekend in New Jersey.\n\n\"If I'm being honest, I have not thought about it at all because I've had so much going on those two weeks,\" said Korda, who took a short break from the tour and hosted her first junior amateur event. \"Then obviously yesterday -- or Monday I had The Met, so haven't had

LPGA legends Annika Sorenstam and Nancy Lopez are the only others to have ever won five consecutive starts.\n\nAs for Zhang, after that maiden victory, it's taken some time for win No. 2.\n\n\"It's been a really interesting journey for me,\" she said. \"I think the first couple months that I was out here it was very adrenaline-based where I was just living the life and kind of going out, having a lot of fun, no expectations, just learning and taking everything in.\"\n\nFOUNDERS CUP: Photo gallery\n\nThen Zhang tipped her cap to Korda and the potential history to be made this week in Clifton, New Jersey.\n\n\"I just want to reiterate, it's so hard winning out here on tour,\" Zhang said. \"What Nelly is doing is something quite unheard of, and only two other players have done it before.\"\n\nZhang's bogey-free round bested the morning wave 65 that was posted by Madelene Sagstrom, who had six birdies and an eagle to go along with just one bogey.\n\nNarin An, Leona Maguire and Stephanie Kyriacou are tied for third at 6 under. There are 10 golfers tied at 4 under before a group of 18 golfers that Korda is apart of at 3 under. Lydia Ko is among those in that cluster. Ko is one point away from clinching a spot in the LPGA Hall of Fame. One more win will punch that ticket.\n\nFive days ago, Zhang joined Michelle Wie West at Yankee Stadium to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by YES Network (@yesnetwork)\n\nNext week, she'll look to defend her lone LPGA title at Liberty National Golf Course.\n\nBut first things first: another 18 holes Friday at the Founders Cup.\n\n\"I think as long as I have that little bit of confidence, no matter what happens the next couple days, I know that I'm going to be able to grind it out and figure something out along the way.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "todd_kelly@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "Todd Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Montclair_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper Montclair Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_Founders_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LPGA Founders Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Zhang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rose Zhang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clifton, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clifton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wie_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Wie West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Kyriacou", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephanie Kyriacou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madelene_Sagstr\u00f6m", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madelene Sagstr\u00f6m"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leona_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leona Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YES_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YES Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_first_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceremonial first pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium_(1923)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium (1923)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Ko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lydia Ko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2024/05/GettyImages-2152228893.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544607", "eventUri": "eng-9544607", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 452993217, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 73, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 73}}}

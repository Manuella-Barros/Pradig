Black voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election.\n\nWhile Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials.\n\nAlso read | Kamala Harris smashes fundraising record with stunning USD 81 million haul over 24 hours\n\nThis was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change.\n\nAnd when we vote, we make history.\"Gemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday. \"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer.\n\nWe register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said. \"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\" Harris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president.\n\nBut other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous. \"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history.\n\nRather, she has learned from those who came before her.\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkinson University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\" \"We were built for this moment,\" she said.Allison, the \"She the People\" founder, agreed.\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com",

This is her first public appearance since President Joe Biden endorsed her to be the next presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Black voters expressed a mix of hope and worry Monday over Joe Biden's exit from the presidential race and the prospect of Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the Democratic nominee.\n\nA key Democratic constituency, Black voters helped power Biden to victory in the 2020 primaries and ultimately to the White House, and they were among his most steadfast supporters, even as calls for him to quit grew. But as much pride as some Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared.\n\n\"I felt like we were doomed,\" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden's announcement. \"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president.\"\n\nBiden's support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favorite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don't like women, especially Black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a Black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\n\"With me being a Black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,\" Jackson said. \"I think now that's going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\"\n\nAn AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut Blacks were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it \"fully backs\" the vice president.\n\nAnd some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden's dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.\n\n\"If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,\" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Woman after woman described in detail what needs to be done before Election Day while also celebrating one of their own.\n\n\"We're together. We're beautiful, we're strong, we're capable. We're ready. We have incredible power in this group,\" she said. \"People just were so hungry for that community and for that feeling of hope.\"\n\nOn Monday night, a \"Black Men for Harris\" online streaming event co-hosted by #WinWithBlackMen, a similar networking group for Black men, drew tens of thousands who pledged to support Harris, and featured speeches from Black male leaders from elected offices, in the civil rights community and business. More than 53,000 people had registered for the call, according to Roland Martin, a Black media leader who moderated the virtual event.\n\nBlack voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election. While Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\n\n\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials. This was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\n\n\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\"\n\nGemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer. We register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\"\n\nHarris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president. But other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous.\n\n\"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history. Rather, she has learned from those who came before her.\n\n\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\"\n\n\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Brown in Atlanta and Sue Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this

The #WinWithBlackWomen network says more than 40,000 Black women joined a Zoom call to support Harris on Sunday, July 21, hours [...]\n\nCONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Four years ago, a Zoom meeting to build support for Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice presidential nominee attracted just 90 participants. On Sunday night, an estimated 90,000 Black women and allies logged on at the same time to support her brand-new presidential campaign.\n\nZoom typically maxes out at 1,000 participants but a female executive at the video conferencing company stepped in to increase the capacity to 40,000, said Aimee Allison, who has attended many of the weekly calls organized by the #WinWithBlackWomen network over the years. And organizers said the meeting was streamed to another 50,000 women on other platforms.\n\n\"It was thrilling,\" Allison said. \"It wasn't chaos.

But as much pride as many Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared.\n\n\"I felt like we were doomed,\" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden's announcement. \"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president.\"\n\nThe apprehension of some Black voters was reminiscent of 2008, when Barack Obama sought the presidency alongside Biden, the vice presidential candidate. Millions of Black people were proud of Obama's candidacy even as they feared he wouldn't be accepted by Americans overall.\n\nCyria Adams, a 37-year-old hairstylist from Smyrna, Georgia, called Biden's decision \"heartbreaking.\" As speculation spread last week that the president might withdraw, she prayed it was just a rumor.\n\n\"I'm nervous. I'm really nervous,\" Adams said.\n\nBiden's support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favorite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don't like women, especially Black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a Black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\n\"With me being a Black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,\" Jackson said. \"I think now that's going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\"\n\nAn AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut Black people were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nIn a show of enthusiasm about the vice president, more than 40,000 Black women participated in a Zoom meeting Sunday organized by a group called #WinWithBlackWomen. The call was held just hours after Biden's announcement and participants raised more than $1.5 million for the Harris campaign.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it \"fully backs\" the vice president.\n\nAnd some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden's dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.\n\n\"If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,\" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.\n\nThe AP-NORC polling shows Blacks generally view Trump negatively. But while about 7 in 10 Black adults have an unfavorable view of Trump, his numbers have improved notably since early 2021.\n\nTrump's campaign has sought to win over more Black voters and members of other minorities.\n\nAnaya Bridges, a 22-year-old student at Georgia State University, said she believed \"some people have been swayed\" by Republican outreach to communities of color, and she is concerned about voter turnout.\n\n\"The timing is terrible,\" she said of Biden's announcement.\n\nJon Diggs, a 40-year-old Atlanta therapist who has generally voted Democratic in past elections, said he was shocked by Biden's decision. Both parties, Diggs said, have work to do.\n\n\"I don't think that either party has done a good job for the middle class and particularly the middle-class African American person,\" he said.\n\nJohnny Bester, a 37-year-old from Atlanta who was riding a scooter alongside Diggs in Piedmont Park, said he was \"not loyal to any brand\" of politics. He said Biden should have dropped out long ago and that he wasn't a fan of the president's endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"A lot of us forgot that she was even in the office, because she hasn't been too vocal.

(AP) -- Four years ago, a Zoom meeting to build support for Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice presidential nominee attracted just 90 participants. On Sunday night, an estimated 90,000 Black women and allies logged on at the same time to support her brand-new presidential campaign.\n\nZoom typically maxes out at 1,000 participants but a female executive at the video conferencing company stepped in to increase the capacity to 40,000, said Aimee Allison, who has attended many of the weekly calls organized by the #WinWithBlackWomen network over the years. And organizers said the meeting was streamed to another 50,000 women on other platforms.\n\n\"It was thrilling,\" Allison said. \"It wasn't chaos. The infrastructure was there amongst Black women to be able to scale and meet the moment. And I think this is the difference-maker Kamala Harris is injecting into the race.\"\n\nWATCH: Harris holds campaign event as majority of Democratic Party delegates pledge support\n\nThe discussion just hours after President Joe Biden announced the end of his reelection campaign and endorsement of Harris had the feel of a revival meeting, said Allison, who founded \"She the People\" to advocate for women of color in politics in 2018. Woman after woman described in detail what needs to be done before Election Day while also celebrating one of their own.\n\n\"We're together. We're beautiful, we're strong, we're capable. We're ready. We have incredible power in this group,\" she said. \"People just were so hungry for that community and for that feeling of hope.\"\n\nOn Monday night, a \"Black Men for Harris\" online streaming event co-hosted by #WinWithBlackMen, a similar networking group for Black men, drew tens of thousands who pledged to support Harris, and featured speeches from Black male leaders from elected offices, in the civil rights community and business. More than 53,000 people had registered for the call, according to Roland Martin, a Black media leader who moderated the virtual event.\n\nWATCH:Rep. Doggett on Democratic enthusiasm for Harris: 'Now we have a fighting chance'\n\nBlack voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election. While Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\n\n\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials. This was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\n\n\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\"\n\nGemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer. We register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\"\n\nHarris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president. But other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous.\n\n\"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history. Rather, she has learned from those who came before her.\n\n\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\"\n\n\"We were built for this moment,\" she said.\n\nAllison, the \"She the People\" founder, agreed.\n\n\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press

But as much pride as some Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared.\n\n\"I felt like we were doomed,\" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden's announcement. \"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president.\"\n\nBiden's support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favorite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don't like women, especially Black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a Black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\n\"With me being a Black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,\" Jackson said. \"I think now that's going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\"\n\nAn AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut Blacks were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it \"fully backs\" the vice president.\n\nAnd some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden's dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.\n\n\"If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,\" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But as much pride as many Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared.\n\n\"I felt like we were doomed,\" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden's announcement. \"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president.\"\n\nThe apprehension of some Black voters was reminiscent of 2008, when Barack Obama sought the presidency alongside Biden, the vice presidential candidate. Millions of Black people were proud of Obama's candidacy even as they feared he wouldn't be accepted by Americans overall.\n\nCyria Adams, a 37-year-old hairstylist from Smyrna, Georgia, called Biden's decision \"heartbreaking.\" As speculation spread last week that the president might withdraw, she prayed it was just a rumor.\n\n\"I'm nervous. I'm really nervous,\" Adams said.\n\nBiden's support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favorite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don't like women, especially Black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a Black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\n\"With me being a Black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,\" Jackson said. \"I think now that's going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\"\n\nAn AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut Black people were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nIn a show of enthusiasm about the vice president, more than 40,000 Black women participated in a Zoom meeting Sunday organized by a group called #WinWithBlackWomen. The call was held just hours after Biden's announcement and participants raised more than $1.5 million for the Harris campaign.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it \"fully backs\" the vice president.\n\nAnd some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden's dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.\n\n\"If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,\" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.\n\nThe AP-NORC polling shows Black people generally view Trump negatively. But while about 7 in 10 Black adults have an unfavorable view of Trump, his numbers have improved notably since early 2021.\n\nTrump's campaign has sought to win over more Black voters and members of other minorities.\n\nAnaya Bridges, a 22-year-old student at Georgia State University, said she believed \"some people have been swayed\" by Republican outreach to communities of color, and she is concerned about voter turnout.\n\n\"The timing is terrible,\" she said of Biden's announcement.\n\nJon Diggs, a 40-year-old Atlanta therapist who has generally voted Democratic in past elections, said he was shocked by Biden's decision. Both parties, Diggs said, have work to do.\n\n\"I don't think that either party has done a good job for the middle class and particularly the middle-class African American person,\" he said.\n\nJohnny Bester, a 37-year-old from Atlanta who was riding a scooter alongside Diggs in Piedmont Park, said he was \"not loyal to any brand\" of politics. He said Biden should have dropped out long ago and that he wasn't a fan of the president's endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"A lot of us forgot that she was even in the office, because she hasn't been too vocal. She hasn't been too visible,\" Bester said.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name":

(AP) -- Four years ago, a Zoom meeting to build support for Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice presidential nominee attracted just 90 participants. On Sunday night, an estimated 90,000 Black women and allies logged on at the same time to support her brand-new presidential campaign.\n\nZoom typically maxes out at 1,000 participants but a female executive at the video conferencing company stepped in to increase the capacity to 40,000, said Aimee Allison, who has attended many of the weekly calls organized by the #WinWithBlackWomen network over the years. And organizers said the meeting was streamed to another 50,000 women on other platforms.\n\n\"It was thrilling,\" Allison said. \"It wasn't chaos. The infrastructure was there amongst Black women to be able to scale and meet the moment. And I think this is the difference-maker Kamala Harris is injecting into the race.\"\n\nThe discussion just hours after President Joe Biden announced the end of his reelection campaign and endorsement of Harris had the feel of a revival meeting, said Allison, who founded \"She the People\" to advocate for women of color in politics in 2018. Woman after woman described in detail what needs to be done before Election Day while also celebrating one of their own.\n\n\"We're together. We're beautiful, we're strong, we're capable. We're ready. We have incredible power in this group,\" she said. \"People just were so hungry for that community and for that feeling of hope.\"\n\nOn Monday night, a \"Black Men for Harris\" online streaming event co-hosted by #WinWithBlackMen, a similar networking group for Black men, drew tens of thousands who pledged to support Harris, and featured speeches from Black male leaders from elected offices, in the civil rights community and business. More than 53,000 people had registered for the call, according to Roland Martin, a Black media leader who moderated the virtual event.\n\nBlack voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election. While Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\n\n\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials. This was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\n\n\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\"\n\nGemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer. We register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\"\n\nHarris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president. But other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous.\n\n\"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history. Rather, she has learned from those who came before her.\n\n\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkinson University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\"\n\n\"We were built for this moment,\" she said.\n\nAllison, the \"She the People\" founder, agreed.\n\n\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Brown in Atlanta and Sue Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.\n\nMore from this section\n\nFederal funds fuel quarterly growth in U.S. down payment assistance

Now, 90,000 Black women support her for president. Zoom's capacity was increased to 40,000, with 50,000 more watching. Harris addressed voter mobilization at Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. Despite concerns, Harris' qualifications are affirmed. Roland Martin moderated 'Black Men for Harris,' celebrating community power.Four years ago, a Zoom meeting to build support for Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice presidential nominee attracted just 90 participants. On Sunday night, an estimated 90,000 Black women and allies logged on at the same time to support her brand-new presidential campaign.\n\nZoom typically maxes out at 1,000 participants but a female executive at the video conferencing company stepped in to increase the capacity to 40,000, said Aimee Allison, who has attended many of the weekly calls organized by the #WinWithBlackWomen network over the years. And organizers said the meeting was streamed to another 50,000 women on other platforms.\n\n\"It was thrilling,\" Allison said. \"It wasn't chaos. The infrastructure was there amongst Black women to be able to scale and meet the moment. And I think this is the difference-maker Kamala Harris is injecting into the race.\"\n\nThe discussion just hours after President Joe Biden announced the end of his reelection campaign and endorsement of Harris had the feel of a revival meeting, said Allison, who founded \"She the People\" to advocate for women of color in politics in 2018. Woman after woman described in detail what needs to be done before Election Day while also celebrating one of their own.\n\n\"We're together. We're beautiful, we're strong, we're capable. We're ready. We have incredible power in this group,\" she said. \"People just were so hungry for that community and for that feeling of hope.\"\n\nOn Monday night, a \"Black Men for Harris\" online streaming event co-hosted by #WinWithBlackMen, a similar networking group for Black men, drew tens of thousands who pledged to support Harris, and featured speeches from Black male leaders from elected offices, in the civil rights community and business. More than 53,000 people had registered for the call, according to Roland Martin, a Black media leader who moderated the virtual event.\n\nBlack voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election. While Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\n\n\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials. This was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\n\n\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\"\n\nGemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer. We register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\"\n\nHarris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president. But other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous.\n\n\"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history. Rather, she has learned from those who came before her.\n\n\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\"\n\n\"We were built for this moment,\" she said.\n\nAllison, the \"She the People\" founder, agreed.\n\n\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Four years ago, a Zoom meeting to build support for Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice presidential nominee attracted just 90 participants. On Sunday night, an estimated 90,000 Black women and allies logged on at the same time to support her brand-new presidential campaign.\n\nZoom typically maxes out at 1,000 participants but a female executive at the video conferencing company stepped in to increase the capacity to 40,000, said Aimee Allison, who has attended many of the weekly calls organized by the #WinWithBlackWomen network over the years. And organizers said the meeting was streamed to another 50,000 women on other platforms.\n\n\"It was thrilling,\" Allison said. \"It wasn't chaos. The infrastructure was there amongst Black women to be able to scale and meet the moment. And I think this is the difference-maker Kamala Harris is injecting into the race.\"\n\nThe discussion just hours after President Joe Biden announced the end of his reelection campaign and endorsement of Harris had the feel of a revival meeting, said Allison, who founded \"She the People\" to advocate for women of color in politics in 2018. Woman after woman described in detail what needs to be done before Election Day while also celebrating one of their own.\n\n\"We're together. We're beautiful, we're strong, we're capable. We're ready. We have incredible power in this group,\" she said. \"People just were so hungry for that community and for that feeling of hope.\"\n\nOn Monday night, a \"Black Men for Harris\" online streaming event co-hosted by #WinWithBlackMen, a similar networking group for Black men, drew tens of thousands who pledged to support Harris, and featured speeches from Black male leaders from elected offices, in the civil rights community and business. More than 53,000 people had registered for the call, according to Roland Martin, a Black media leader who moderated the virtual event.\n\nBlack voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election. While Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\n\n\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials. This was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\n\n\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\"\n\nGemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer. We register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\"\n\nHarris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president. But other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous.\n\n\"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history. Rather, she has learned from those who came before her.\n\n\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkinson University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\"\n\n\"We were built for this moment,\" she said.\n\nAllison, the \"She the People\" founder, agreed.\n\n\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press

But as much pride as some Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared.\n\n\"I felt like we were doomed,\" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden's announcement. \"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president.\"\n\nCyria Adams, a 37-year-old hairstylist from Smyrna, Georgia, called Biden's decision \"heartbreaking.\" As speculation spread last week that the president might withdraw, she prayed it was just a rumor.\n\n\"I'm nervous. I'm really nervous,\" Adams said.\n\nBiden's support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favorite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don't like women, especially Black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a Black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\n\"With me being a Black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,\" Jackson said. \"I think now that's going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\"\n\nAn AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut Blacks were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it \"fully backs\" the vice president.\n\nAnd some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden's dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.\n\n\"If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,\" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.\n\nThe AP-NORC polling shows Blacks generally view Trump negatively. But while about 7 in 10 Black adults have an unfavorable view of Trump, his numbers have improved notably since early 2021.\n\nTrump's campaign has sought to win over more Black voters and members of other minorities.\n\nJon Diggs, a 40-year-old Atlanta therapist who has generally voted Democratic in past elections, said he was shocked by Biden's decision. Both parties, Diggs said, have work to do.\n\n\"I don't think that either party has done a good job for the middle class and particularly the middle-class African American person,\" he said.\n\nJohnny Bester, a 37-year-old from Atlanta who was riding a scooter alongside Diggs in Piedmont Park, said he was \"not loyal to any brand\" of politics. He said Biden should have dropped out long ago and that he wasn't a fan of the president's endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"A lot of us forgot that she was even in the office, because she hasn't been too vocal. She hasn't been too visible,\" Bester said.", "source": {"uri": "wthr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTHR-TV 13 NBC Indianapolis"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Maxine Waters, Jasmine Crockett, and Joyce Beatty shared remarks to the attendees, who included journalists, civil rights and nonprofit leaders, and regular citizens.\n\nMany attendees left unified, motivated, and ready to organize, according to multiple posts on X.\n\n\"That Zoom call was truly inspiring. What a historic moment. Sleeping with a smile on my face,\" one attendee noted.\n\nAnother participant wrote, \"Thank you to Win With Black Women for hosting such a historic Zoom meeting last night. The discussions led by the incredible women leaders emphasized the importance of this election & next steps we can take to support. The call was truly inspiring.\"\n\nRead More: Biden Steps Aside, Makes Way for Harris\n\nThis comes as many of Harris' detractors question whether she's the right fit to become the next president. If she does, Harris, who is Black and of South Asian descent, will be the second Black person, and first woman, to serve in such a capacity.\n\nIt also underscores how Black women historically have been the backbone of the Democratic Party, and their support can shape election outcomes, just as it did when they elected Biden as president in 2020. Prior to Biden's announcement, more than 1,400 Black women still affirmed their support for Biden-Harris when some Democrats called on the president to step down. A recent survey from The Cut, which focused solely on Black women ages 18 to 55, found that 64% of Black women said they'd vote for Biden whereas only 18% say they'd vote for former President Donald Trump, who is the confirmed nominee for the Republican Party.\n\nSince Sunday, Harris has garnered endorsements from key Democratic leaders, including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, placing Harris as front-runner in the Democratic Party. Her campaign also raised over $100 million since Biden backed out of the race.\n\nThe outpour of support continues as a network of Black men, through Win With Black Men, plans to host a similar meeting called Black Men for Harris on July 22, hoping to mobilize men ahead of the November election.\n\n\"Win With Black Men started 4 months ago and we just started planning the barbershop tour, fast forward to now through Win With Black Women we're about to co lead one of the biggest minority grassroots movements in history to elect our first Woman Black President,\" one member tweeted.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Crockett", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Crockett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Beatty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joyce Beatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qPGs.Yxtkwq7wUkIHv_qGw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/capital_b_articles_192/1fdff26eb63ff8dbeda515dd9b33695d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 2840, "textEnd": 2847}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Four years ago, a Zoom meeting to build support for Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice presidential nominee attracted just 90 participants. On Sunday night, an estimated 90,000 Black women and allies logged on at the same time to support her brand-new presidential campaign.\n\nZoom typically maxes out at 1,000 participants but a female executive at the video conferencing company stepped in to increase the capacity to 40,000, said Aimee Allison, who has attended many of the weekly calls organized by the #WinWithBlackWomen network over the years. And organizers said the meeting was streamed to another 50,000 women on other platforms.\n\n\"It was thrilling,\" Allison said. \"It wasn't chaos. The infrastructure was there amongst Black women to be able to scale and meet the moment. And I think this is the difference-maker Kamala Harris is injecting into the race.\"\n\nThe discussion just hours after President Joe Biden announced the end of his reelection campaign and endorsement of Harris had the feel of a revival meeting, said Allison, who founded \"She the People\" to advocate for women of color in politics in 2018. Woman after woman described in detail what needs to be done before Election Day while also celebrating one of their own.\n\n\"We're together. We're beautiful, we're strong, we're capable. We're ready. We have incredible power in this group,\" she said. \"People just were so hungry for that community and for that feeling of hope.\"\n\nOn Monday night, a \"Black Men for Harris\" online streaming event co-hosted by #WinWithBlackMen, a similar networking group for Black men, drew tens of thousands who pledged to support Harris, and featured speeches from Black male leaders from elected offices, in the civil rights community and business. More than 53,000 people had registered for the call, according to Roland Martin, a Black media leader who moderated the virtual event.\n\nBlack voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election. While Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\n\n\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials. This was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\n\n\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\"\n\nGemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer. We register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\"\n\nHarris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president. But other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous.\n\n\"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history. Rather, she has learned from those who came before her.\n\n\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkinson University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\"\n\n\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Brown in Atlanta and Sue Haigh in Hartford, Connecticut, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But as much pride as some Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared.\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris Files Nomination for US Presidential Elections 2024: Vice President Lauds Joe Biden's Work, Calls His Legacy of Achievements 'Unmatched' in First Remarks (Watch Video).\n\n\"I felt like we were doomed,\" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden's announcement. \"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president.\"\n\nCyria Adams, a 37-year-old hairstylist from Smyrna, Georgia, called Biden's decision \"heartbreaking.\" As speculation spread last week that the president might withdraw, she prayed it was just a rumour.\n\nAlso Read | Kamala Harris Moves To Lock Nomination After Joe Biden Drops Out of US Presidential Election 2024 Race; Picks Up Endorsement, Campaign Cash.\n\n\"I'm nervous. I'm really nervous,\" Adams said.\n\nBiden's support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favourite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don't like women, especially Black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a Black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\n\"With me being a Black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,\" Jackson said. \"I think now that's going to be a whole other battle, as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\"\n\nAn AP-NORC Centre for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed scepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut Blacks were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris.

But as much pride as some Black Americans feel about the possibility of Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent, becoming president, the upending of the race has some voters feeling scared.\n\n\"I felt like we were doomed,\" said Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, recounting her reaction to Biden\u00b4s announcement. \"I don\u00b4t see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president.\"\n\nBiden\u00b4s support of Harris and the immediate coalescing of other party leaders around her makes her the prohibitive favorite to replace him at the top of the presidential ticket. But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some Black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don\u00b4t like women, especially Black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can\u00b4t win, how can a Black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, July 22, 2024, during an event with NCAA college athletes.

More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only 3 in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut Blacks were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden\u00b4s lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it \"fully backs\" the vice president.\n\nAnd some Black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden\u00b4s dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.\n\n\"If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,\" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris arrives to speak from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, July 22, 2024, during an event with NCAA college athletes.

There was text after text heralding the growing likelihood that Kamala Harris would be the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nCarr, whose organization she co-founded to support Black female candidates, wasn't surprised people would reach out as they heard the news.\n\nBut when she logged onto a Zoom call that evening to mobilize support for Harris, she was excited to learn there were tens of thousands of other Black women there as energized as she was.\n\nMore than 44,000 people, mostly women, joined Sunday's video call, which lasted well past midnight and netted more than $1.5 million for the Harris campaign, organizers said. Some signed up to work in their communities and pledged to ramp up get-out-the-vote efforts in the wake of President Joe Biden's decision to step down from his re-election bid and endorse Harris.\n\nBut they're also bracing for attacks against the vice president who would make history as the first woman of color to become a major party nominee.\n\n\"We celebrated (last night),\" Carr said Monday, \"but today we're going to protect defend, fight, organize and mobilize.\"\n\nA few social media sites were already brimming by Monday afternoon with criticisms about Harris' policies, her intelligence, her laugh and her accomplishments.\n\nCarr and others also believe it was intentional that several speakers at the National Republican Convention earlier this month mispronounced Harris' first name. \"That had coded undertones,\" she said.\n\nFreda Player, an elected Metro Nashville school board member and Tennessee Democratic delegate, expects Harris will face a barrage of criticism and skepticism because of her race and gender.\n\n\"It's going to be a rocky road, especially where we are in this country,\" Player said. \"But we can appeal to our better angels and show the world that this is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nThe audacity of hope\n\nStill, Harris' candidacy seemed to inspire the kind of hope not seen since Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, activists said. Obama was the nation's first African American president and his 2008 run for the presidency led to record Black voter turnout in many places.\n\nOn Monday, Tennessee state Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis, choked up when reflecting on her own political path and the effect a Harris nomination, and potential presidency, could have on other young Black women.\n\nLamar, chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus, recalled her she felt when she watched Obama and his wife Michelle take the stage after his historic nomination.\n\n\"I didn't really think an African-American girl could pursue politics until I saw them on that stage,\" said Lamar.\n\nShe's now the youngest senator and youngest Black lawmaker to serve in Tennessee's senate, and last year became the youngest senator in state history to give birth while in office.\n\n\"When I see Kamala on stage, I want to go hard for her, because I hope another young woman, whether she's Black or any woman who cares about this country, feels the way I did in 2008,\" Lamar said.\n\nBlack women activists and allies said Harris' bid is reinvigorating the Democratic Party and particularly younger voters.\n\n\"There's a new shot of energy,\" said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, which has launched get-out-the-vote efforts across the country. \"I think she brings a fresh new level of hope.''\n\n\"We've not seen that level of excitement since Obama,\" Brown added.\n\nMelanie Campbell, chair of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, called this campaign a seminal moment.\n\nCampbell believes the bid could impact Black voter turnout particularly among women and that the support may come beyond the fact that Harris is a woman of color. The country has had a Black president, but never a woman, Campbell said.\n\n\"You have an opportunity for a woman to become president,'' she said. \"That's a big deal.\"\n\nFor years, Black women led groups have been ramping up get-out-the-vote efforts and building infrastructures to support Black women candidates.\n\nBlack female voters helped Doug Jones pull off an upset in Alabama in 2017, making him the state's first Democratic senator in 25 years.\n\n\"The magic of Black women organizing is that it is done organically,'' said Carr, noting Sunday's Zoom call. \"That's what you saw last night.''\n\nOhio Rep. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat and former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, was one of the guest speakers on that call. She's often a regular on the calls, organized by #WinWithBlackWomen, a collective of intergenerational, intersectional Black women leaders. She calls them \"truth to power conversations.\"\n\nThere are usually a couple of hundred attendees. She described Sunday's turnout as amazing.\n\n\"It says to me not only is this the right moment in history (but) that people were there to learn what role they could play,'' Beatty told USA TODAY. \"It was a good sign. It was about showing that women are more than 50% of our voting base. Black women have certainly led the way. And it also said that we're ready because it's go time and we have the receipts to prove it.''\n\nIn addition to Beatty, speakers on the off-the-record call included heads of national civic engagement organizations, faith leaders, congressional lawmakers and well-known community activists.\n\nCarr's group, Higher Heights of America, which supports Black female candidates and more Black political involvement, hosted its own call Monday night.\n\nAnother call, this time for Black men, also took place Monday evening. \"They have not had a call of this nature as Black men, and they have organized one in less than 24 hours,\" said Stefanie Brown James, founder and senior advisor at Collective PAC, which aims to build Black political power. \"That just goes to show you that folks are ready.\"\n\nSome Black sororities and fraternities have also pledged to help. Harris is scheduled to speak Wednesday in Indianapolis at a conference of Zeta Phi Beta, a Black sorority and one of the nine elite Black Greek organizations.\n\nBeatty said people want to be engaged and support Harris not just because she's a Black woman, but because she's a Black woman who has the experience, skills and knowledge to be a great president.\n\n\"People are all in because she is battle tested,\" Beatty said.\n\nHesitations and fears of backlash\n\nBut not everyone is optimistic about a Harris run.\n\nOneika Tinsley of Pleasant Hill, California, said she plans to vote for Harris by default and disgust. Tinsley is a mother of five, who doesn't think the Biden-Harris administration has done enough to improve the economy.\n\n\"(Harris) is a beautiful woman with style and flair and I see everyone is aligned with her, but what about a mother who already knows she likely can't afford to send her youngest daughter to college?\" Tinsley said. \"When is she going to speak to me and others like me?\"\n\nTinsley said Harris has played it too safe addressing topics for the past four years.\n\n\"I'm not voting for Kamala because she's a Black woman like me,\" Tinsley, a registered Democrat, continued. \"I'm just voting for Kamala because she's the lesser of two evils and all we have to go with.\"\n\nSome Black women worried that a Black woman wouldn't make the best candidate against Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has long been known for his politically incorrect, racially charged stances.\n\n\"While I personally would love to see a Black female president in my lifetime, I don't think we should have a woman of color against Trump,\" said Olivia Jones, a 22-year-old senior at Central Michigan University from Lansing, Michigan. \"It's unsafe territory. Of course, I'm going to support her, but it's not the smart pick. This is such an important election. This is not the time to chance it.\"\n\nWomen activists said while racist and sexist attacks aren't new, they're alarmed at how overt they are even in the first 24 hours of Harris' candidacy.\n\nTrump himself posted to his social media website Truth Social on Monday afternoon and evening accusing Harris of being a terrible vice president, imcompetent, a liar, dumb, and way behind him in polls, which isn't accurate, acording to the most recent surveys.\n\nCarr said Black women expect that Trump and his fellow Republican leaders will aggressively target Harris on social media and in advertising campaigns.\n\n\"We expect not only that he will go after her...it's going to be rooted in misinformation and disinformation and negativity,'' Carr said.\n\nThey plan to counter Trump attacks with information campaigns, including on social media, about Harris and her record.\n\nBlack women will \"push back against unfair attacks,'' Campbell said.\n\nAnge-Marie Hancock, executive director of the Kirwan Institute at The Ohio State University and curator of the Kamala Harris Project, a consortium of scholars from the country studying the vice president, said Harris' historic bid will be challenging.\n\n\"This will still be a test for the United States,'' Hancock said. \"Even though she's had these almost four years and even though she's clearly capable, women elected officials are much less popular when they're running for office than when they're in office.\"\n\nThe campaign would also have to figure out how to counteract attacks against her as a woman of color.\n\n\"They can't just pretend like that doesn't exist,'' Hancock said.\n\nWith less than four months until Election Day, some activists vow to double down on get-out-the-vote efforts and share information about Harris' policies and plans.\n\nPlayer, the Nashville school board member and executive director of Emerge Tennessee, which helps recruit and train Democratic women for office, called Harris' nomination \"validating\" for Black women, who have been the \"backbone of the Democratic Party for decades.\n\n\"It's refreshing. It's motivating. It's inspiring that we finally have our fair chance,\" she said. \"I think that's what her nomination does for a lot of women of color. We're not overlooked, we're not invisible, and our support is not taken for granted or in vain.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [],

(AP) -- Four years ago, a Zoom meeting to build support for Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice presidential nominee attracted just 90 participants. On Sunday night, an estimated 90,000 Black women and allies logged on at the same time to support her brand-new presidential campaign.\n\nZoom typically maxes out at 1,000 participants but a female executive at the video conferencing company stepped in to increase the capacity to 40,000, said Aimee Allison, who has attended many of the weekly calls organized by the #WinWithBlackWomen network over the years. And organizers said the meeting was streamed to another 50,000 women on other platforms.\n\n\"It was thrilling,\" Allison said. \"It wasn't chaos. The infrastructure was there amongst Black women to be able to scale and meet the moment. And I think this is the difference-maker Kamala Harris is injecting into the race.\"\n\nThe discussion just hours after President Joe Biden announced the end of his reelection campaign and endorsement of Harris had the feel of a revival meeting, said Allison, who founded \"She the People\" to advocate for women of color in politics in 2018. Woman after woman described in detail what needs to be done before Election Day while also celebrating one of their own.\n\n\"We're together. We're beautiful, we're strong, we're capable. We're ready. We have incredible power in this group,\" she said. \"People just were so hungry for that community and for that feeling of hope.\"\n\nOn Monday night, a \"Black Men for Harris\" online streaming event co-hosted by #WinWithBlackMen, a similar networking group for Black men, drew tens of thousands who pledged to support Harris, and featured speeches from Black male leaders from elected offices, in the civil rights community and business. More than 53,000 people had registered for the call, according to Roland Martin, a Black media leader who moderated the virtual event.\n\nBlack voters in general, and women in particular, were key to Biden's victories in both the 2020 primaries and general election. While Donald Trump had a modest advantage among white women, Biden won overwhelmingly among Black women, 93% to Trump's 6%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters.\n\nJust last week, more than 1,300 Black female leaders and allies published a letter supporting Biden and Harris. But if Sunday and Monday's calls are any indication, they're now all-in for Harris, who is of Black and Indian descent.\n\n\"This wasn't just policy people or legislative people or elected officials. This was across the board. Everybody came with their toolbox and was like, okay, so how do we pitch in?\" said Angelique Roche, a writer and consultant who described the call as powerful and galvanizing.\n\n\"These were different generations with different education levels, different jobs, different backgrounds, different industries, all coming to the table and saying, we're ready, we're in,\" she said.\n\nEarlier this month, Harris herself extolled \"the power of sisterhood and service\" when she addressed the annual gathering of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which she joined as a student at Howard University, one of the nation's most storied historically Black colleges.\n\n\"Our nation is counting on the leaders in this room to guide us forward,\" she told the crowd of Black women, some shaking pompoms to cheer her on. \"When we mobilize, nations change. And when we vote, we make history.\"\n\nGemeem Davis, a Democratic convention delegate from Bridgeport, Connecticut, echoed that sentiment Monday.\n\n\"Black women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party. We show up. We vote. We volunteer. We register people to vote, there's lots of organizing on the ground,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with working class folks and progressives, we are the base of this party, and our voices have to be heard.\"\n\nHarris, Davis said, is qualified and ready to be president. But other Black female voters expressed concerns about her ability to win should she become the nominee. Brianna Smith, a 24-year-old school counselor from Decatur, Georgia, said she's been reading more about Harris since Biden's announcement and has been impressed. But she remains nervous.\n\n\"I don't see America actually accepting the fact that a Black woman is running for president,\" she said.\n\nWhile Harris' path to the potential nomination may be unusual, Harris herself \"is not a unicorn\" who sprang out of nowhere and is unprepared for this moment, said Martha Jones, author of a book about Black women in American political history. Rather, she has learned from those who came before her.\n\n\"A part of her political identity is a kind of nimbleness and a kind of adaptability,\" said Jones, a history professor at Johns Hopkinson University.\n\nLikewise, many Black women are already pivoting to help Harris, said Glynda Car, president of Higher Heights, an organization that bills itself as a \"political home for Black women.\"\n\n\"We were built for this moment,\" she said.\n\nAllison, the \"She the People\" founder, agreed.\n\n\"We didn't have to get ready, because we stay ready,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press

There was text after text heralding the growing likelihood that Kamala Harris would be the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nCarr, whose organization she co-founded to support Black female candidates, wasn't surprised people would reach out as they heard the news.\n\nBut when she logged onto a Zoom call that evening to mobilize support for Harris, she was excited to learn there were tens of thousands of other Black women there as energized as she was.\n\nMore than 44,000 people, mostly women, joined Sunday's video call, which lasted well past midnight and netted more than $1.5 million for the Harris campaign, organizers said. Some signed up to work in their communities and pledged to ramp up get-out-the-vote efforts in the wake of President Joe Biden's decision to step down from his re-election bid and endorse Harris.\n\nBut they're also bracing for attacks against the vice president who would make history as the first woman of color to become a major party nominee.\n\n\"We celebrated (last night),\" Carr said Monday, \"but today we're going to protect defend, fight, organize and mobilize.\"\n\nA few social media sites were already brimming by Monday afternoon with criticisms about Harris' policies, her intelligence, her laugh and her accomplishments.\n\nCarr and others also believe it was intentional that several speakers at the National Republican Convention earlier this month mispronounced Harris' first name. \"That had coded undertones,\" she said.\n\nFreda Player, an elected Metro Nashville school board member and Tennessee Democratic delegate, expects Harris will face a barrage of criticism and skepticism because of her race and gender.\n\n\"It's going to be a rocky road, especially where we are in this country,\" Player said. \"But we can appeal to our better angels and show the world that this is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nStill, Harris' candidacy seemed to inspire the kind of hope not seen since Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, activists said. Obama was the nation's first African American president and his 2008 run for the presidency led to record Black voter turnout in many places.\n\nOn Monday, Tennessee state Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis, choked up when reflecting on her own political path and the effect a Harris nomination, and potential presidency, could have on other young Black women.\n\nLamar, chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus, recalled her she felt when she watched Obama and his wife Michelle take the stage after his historic nomination.\n\n\"I didn't really think an African-American girl could pursue politics until I saw them on that stage,\" said Lamar.\n\nShe's now the youngest senator and youngest Black lawmaker to serve in Tennessee's senate, and last year became the youngest senator in state history to give birth while in office.\n\n\"When I see Kamala on stage, I want to go hard for her, because I hope another young woman, whether she's Black or any woman who cares about this country, feels the way I did in 2008,\" Lamar said.\n\nBlack women activists and allies said Harris' bid is reinvigorating the Democratic Party and particularly younger voters.\n\n\"There's a new shot of energy,\" said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, which has launched get-out-the-vote efforts across the country. \"I think she brings a fresh new level of hope.''\n\n\"We've not seen that level of excitement since Obama,\" Brown added.\n\nMelanie Campbell, chair of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, called this campaign a seminal moment.\n\nCampbell believes the bid could impact Black voter turnout particularly among women and that the support may come beyond the fact that Harris is a woman of color. The country has had a Black president, but never a woman, Campbell said.\n\n\"You have an opportunity for a woman to become president,'' she said. \"That's a big deal.\"\n\n\"It's unchartered waters,'' Campbell said.\n\nFor years, Black women led groups have been ramping up get-out-the-vote efforts and building infrastructures to support Black women candidates.\n\nBlack female voters helped Doug Jones pull off an upset in Alabama in 2017, making him the state's first Democratic senator in 25 years.\n\n\"The magic of Black women organizing is that it is done organically,'' said Carr, noting Sunday's Zoom call. \"That's what you saw last night.''\n\nOhio Rep. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat and former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, was one of the guest speakers on that call. She's often a regular on the calls, organized by #WinWithBlackWomen, a collective of intergenerational, intersectional Black women leaders. She calls them \"truth to power conversations.\"\n\nThere are usually a couple of hundred attendees. She described Sunday's turnout as amazing.\n\n\"It says to me not only is this the right moment in history (but) that people were there to learn what role they could play,'' Beatty told USA TODAY. \"It was a good sign. It was about showing that women are more than 50% of our voting base. Black women have certainly led the way. And it also said that we're ready because it's go time and we have the receipts to prove it.''\n\nIn addition to Beatty, speakers on the off-the-record call included heads of national civic engagement organizations, faith leaders, congressional lawmakers and well-known community activists.\n\nCarr's group, Higher Heights of America, which supports Black female candidates and more Black political involvement, hosted its own call Monday night.\n\nAnother call, this time for Black men, also took place Monday evening. \"They have not had a call of this nature as Black men, and they have organized one in less than 24 hours,\" said Stefanie Brown James, founder and senior advisor at Collective PAC, which aims to build Black political power. \"That just goes to show you that folks are ready.\"\n\nSome Black sororities and fraternities have also pledged to help. Harris is scheduled to speak Wednesday in Indianapolis at a conference of Zeta Phi Beta, a Black sorority and one of the nine elite Black Greek organizations.\n\nBeatty said people want to be engaged and support Harris not just because she's a Black woman, but because she's a Black woman who has the experience, skills and knowledge to be a great president.\n\n\"People are all in because she is battle tested,\" Beatty said.\n\nBut not everyone is optimistic about a Harris run.\n\nOneika Tinsley of Pleasant Hill, California, said she plans to vote for Harris by default and disgust. Tinsley is a mother of five, who doesn't think the Biden-Harris administration has done enough to improve the economy.\n\n\"(Harris) is a beautiful woman with style and flair and I see everyone is aligned with her, but what about a mother who already knows she likely can't afford to send her youngest daughter to college?\" Tinsley said. \"When is she going to speak to me and others like me?\"\n\nTinsley said Harris has played it too safe addressing topics for the past four years.\n\n\"I'm not voting for Kamala because she's a Black woman like me,\" Tinsley, a registered Democrat, continued. \"I'm just voting for Kamala because she's the lesser of two evils and all we have to go with.\"\n\nSome Black women worried that a Black woman wouldn't make the best candidate against Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has long been known for his politically incorrect, racially charged stances.\n\n\"While I personally would love to see a Black female president in my lifetime, I don't think we should have a woman of color against Trump,\" said Olivia Jones, a 22-year-old senior at Central Michigan University from Lansing, Michigan. \"It's unsafe territory. Of course, I'm going to support her, but it's not the smart pick. This is such an important election. This is not the time to chance it.\"\n\nWomen activists said while racist and sexist attacks aren't new, they're alarmed at how overt they are even in the first 24 hours of Harris' candidacy.\n\nTrump himself posted to his social media website Truth Social on Monday afternoon and evening accusing Harris of being a terrible vice president, imcompetent, a liar, dumb, and way behind him in polls, which isn't accurate, acording to the most recent surveys.\n\nCarr said Black women expect that Trump and his fellow Republican leaders will aggressively target Harris on social media and in advertising campaigns.\n\n\"We expect not only that he will go after her...it's going to be rooted in misinformation and disinformation and negativity,'' Carr said.\n\nThey plan to counter Trump attacks with information campaigns, including on social media, about Harris and her record.\n\nBlack women will \"push back against unfair attacks,'' Campbell said.\n\nAnge-Marie Hancock, executive director of the Kirwan Institute at The Ohio State University and curator of the Kamala Harris Project, a consortium of scholars from the country studying the vice president, said Harris' historic bid will be challenging.\n\n\"This will still be a test for the United States,'' Hancock said. \"Even though she's had these almost four years and even though she's clearly capable, women elected officials are much less popular when they're running for office than when they're in office.\"\n\nThe campaign would also have to figure out how to counteract attacks against her as a woman of color.\n\n\"They can't just pretend like that doesn't exist,'' Hancock said.\n\nWith less than four months until Election Day, some activists vow to double down on get-out-the-vote efforts and share information about Harris' policies and plans.\n\nPlayer, the Nashville school board member and executive director of Emerge Tennessee, which helps recruit and train Democratic women for office, called Harris' nomination \"validating\" for Black women, who have been the \"backbone of the Democratic Party for decades.\n\n\"It's refreshing. It's motivating. It's inspiring that we finally have our fair chance,\" she said. \"I think that's what her nomination does for a lot of women of color. We're not overlooked, we're not invisible, and our support is not taken for granted or in vain.\"\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes, Terry Collins, Rebecca Morin, Melissa Brown, The (Nashville)

As her campaign moves forward, the work and votes of Black women - at the DNC and at the polls - have the potential to get her there.\n\nAfter an unprecedented turn of events on the campaign trail, and multiple Democratic leaders and donors calling for President Biden to leave the presidential race, Biden officially announced the end to his campaign on Sunday, endorsing Vice President Harris as the Democratic nominee. Immediately after donations poured into ActBlue, the digital donation portal used by Democrats, with the website processing over $80 million in under 24 hours.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that at its peak, ActBlue reached $11.5 million in a single hour on Sunday, with the Harris campaign specifically garnering $49.6 million in funding by 5 a.m. EST this morning.\n\nWithin just a few hours on Sunday, Win With Black Women, an organization of women Black political, activist and spiritual leaders, organized a nationwide Zoom call, with over 44,000 Black women in attendance, reported Essence. According to Win With Black Women, the organization raised $1.5 million in three hours.\n\n\"When Black women go to work...WE go to work. $1.5 million in 3 hours via @WinWithBlackWomen because we BELIEVE in @VP @KamalaHarris to lead this country, as the next President,\" Dr. Regina Davis Moss, president and CEO of In Our Own Voice tweeted this morning.\n\nHarris made history as the first woman, Black person or South Asian to serve as vice president and should she be elected in November, would become the first Black woman or South Asian to ever serve as president. However, Harris is not the official nominee yet. She must receive the majority of the 4,700 delegates during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month in order to represent the party and appear against Trump on the ballot in November.\n\nAccording to aggregate of national polling conducted by Decision Desk HQ and the Hill, Trump has a 2.7% lead on Harris, with 45.3% support to Trump's 48%.\n\nBlack women heavily back the Democratic Party, but don't feel like the party has their back. Polling by KFF published earlier this month found that 67% of Black women voters identify as Democrat, and 56% feel like the party does better than the Republican Party than \"looking out for people like them.\" According to the poll, 1 in 3 Black women say that neither party looks out for them.\n\nTexas delegate Passion Jackson has been involved in the Democratic Party since Al Gore's 2000 campaign.\n\nBut despite living through Florida's hanging chad debacle, the swiftboating of John Kerry and Hillary's emails, she hasn't seen anything like the events of this weekend.\n\n\"This is just new -- and I'm excited about it,\" Jackson tells Reckon.\n\nIn about a month, Jackson, a East Texas native and current Dallas resident, will serve as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. But now with President Joe Biden's tectonic announcement over the weekend that he would end his bid for a second term to the presidency, delegates like Jackson are free to support any candidate they wish.\n\nFor her and tens of thousands of other Black women -- from elected officials to Black community leaders to anonymous social-media users -- that candidate is Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"This is actually their worst-case scenario,\" Jackson says of the Republican Party and their slate of former President Donald Trump and his running mate U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio. \"Because what can they say? She was a prosecutor, and she was tough on crime. She's also been an attorney general. It's really going to be tough for them to come back against her.\"\n\nBefore Sunday, Jackson was a staunch supporter of Biden's. She cites his shepherding the passage of the $461 billion bipartisan infrastructure bill, a push to manufacture more computer chips in the U.S., expanding loans to Black-owned small businesses and clearing millions of dollars worth of student-loan debt as keystone accomplishments for the president.\n\nRather than a free-for-all at the Democratic convention in August, for which some party members have expressed support, Jackson wants the party unified around a nominee in the coming weeks as well as a Harris running mate who can also bring unity to the party.\n\nIn the meantime, Black women are steeling themselves for the inevitable onslaught of racist and misogynistic attacks to be thrown Harris' way.\n\n\"We're going to get to see ... how ugly they can be towards Black women.

As questions arose around legality, electability, and ability to beat Trump, one question rose to the top, \"Is the nation ready for its first Black women president?\"\n\nThe organization \"Win with Black women\" is working to make sure that it is. Hours after Harris announced her candidacy on Sunday evening, the organization sent out a message on social media inviting Black women across the nation to join a zoom call to discuss election strategy. The call, which at its height had over 44,000 participants, raised over 1.5 million dollars for the Harris campaign.\n\nFounded by Jatoka Eaddy, Win With Black Women has stood behind the Vice president since her first bid for the White House in 2016. After Harris dropped out of the race, the organization was a key lobbyist for her placement on the Biden ticket. After the announcement of her selection, #WinWithBlackWomen went viral on social media and since then, the organization has continued to support what it calls, \"the historic number of Black women running for elected office at the federal, state and local levels.\"\n\nThe momentum of Black voter support didn't stop with women. On Monday evening, \"Win With Black Men\" hosted a similar meeting that boasted over 21,000 attendees. Prominent politicians, community leaders and celebrities affirmed their support for Harris, and at the conclusion of the call, an additional $1.2 million dollars was raised for the campaign.\n\nBlack voters are a key demographic each party hopes to woo ahead of the coming election. In anticipation of the battle ahead, organizations such as Win With Black Women and Win With Black Men, are fighting to change the tide in a country that historically has been adverse to elevating Black people, and Black women in particular.\n\nGrassroots organizations have a long history in helping get voters to the polls. One member of the organization tweeted \"Win with Black men started four months ago, and we just started planning.... Fast-forward now through Win With Black Women.

Black women, poised to play a major role in the upcoming election, mobilized and rapidly arranged fundraising bids. For instance, on July 21, an advocacy group, Win With Black Women, raised an impressive $1.5 million within just three hours.\n\nThe group also organized an impromptu Zoom call that drew more than 44,000 Black women, to strategize on the best ways to support Harris, Washington Examiner reported. The meeting, initially at capacity, saw organizer Jotaka Eaddy scrambling to expand its size to accommodate the surge in participants. The call featured some of the nation's most prominent Black leaders, including Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-OH), the immediate past chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Reflecting on the personal significance of this moment, Beatty told MSNBC, \"For us, it's personal, and we stand with Vice President Harris.\"\n\nOther notable attendees included Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump, Donna Brazile, former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX), a rising star within the Democratic Party, and Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. During the call, participants were encouraged to share a graphic on social media to lend their support for Harris.\n\nHarris, already a trailblazer as the first US Black and Asian American vice president, now has the chance to make history once more. If elected, she would become the nation's first Black woman president and its second Black president following Barack Obama. However, securing the formal Democratic nomination will be the first critical step.\n\nWith the national convention in Chicago just weeks away, the Democratic National Committee's rules committee is set to meet on Wednesday to establish a transparent and fair framework for selecting a new nominee. Meanwhile, Trump continues to galvanize the GOP. Republicans have already begun to attack Harris, attempting to tie her to the challenges faced during Biden's tenure and labeling her as \"radical.\"\n\nWhile Harris is likely to solidify support among Black women, who remain the Democrats' most loyal voting bloc, she will need to focus on gaining the backing of Black men, a group that Trump and his allies are actively courting. \"We got four months to continue to work to make sure that we get people, particularly Black males, to the polls,\" Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) previously told Washington Examiner. \"President Trump gets 25% of the Black male vote. It's mathematically not even a conversation.\" However, Black female leaders are still mainly in agreement with Harris. \"I am confident that she will have the delegates. She will have the resources, and she will have the volunteers,\" Brazile told ABC's David Muir.", "source": {"uri": "inquisitr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Inquisitr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Beatty", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joyce Beatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Crockett", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Crockett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Brazile", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donna Brazile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Muir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Muir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/706743/uploads/f5614140-48ca-11ef-9d4f-51593840102d_1200_630.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 304, "textEnd": 311}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

James Clyburn of South Carolina, \"ridin' with Biden\" no matter what.\n\nThat powerful defense, though, has not been driven solely by a yearning for a second term of the Biden presidency, according to interviews with dozens of them over the past week. It is also born of a palpable fear among many Black and Hispanic Democrats that in their rush to ditch Biden, some in the party will also seek to skip over Harris, throwing open the nominating process in a way that would defy the will of their communities.\n\n\"I'm in these rooms; I see what they say in conversations,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said during a social media stream Thursday night. \"A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president. They are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\nPublic support for Biden to stay in the race is not unanimous among Black and Hispanic members of Congress.\n\nIn recent days, at least a half-dozen of them have called for Biden to step aside or have expressed grave concerns about his ability to win in November. They include Reps. Marc Veasey of Texas, Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico and Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva of Arizona.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" Veasey wrote in a letter joined by three other lawmakers, not all of whom were Black or Hispanic.\n\n\"It is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" they wrote Friday.\n\nOne of the factors prolonging what has been an agonizing period of reckoning among Democrats about Biden's fate is a racial divide on the future of their party, and who should have the greatest say in what it looks like.\n\nBlack lawmakers and voters have long been a core of his base. Veteran Black and Hispanic lawmakers have celebrated Biden's domestic agenda as delivering for their constituents.\n\nStill, Biden's support has slipped among the rank and file. Black voters remain among his strongest backers, but were about evenly divided on whether Biden should stay in the race in a recent AP-NORC poll. And Republicans have made inroads among Black and Latino voters since the 2020 election, polling suggests.\n\nBut underlying the sense of urgency among many Black lawmakers to defend the president is a feeling that those pushing the hardest for Biden to go are predominantly white lawmakers and an elite class of donors who do not necessarily back Harris and are not prioritizing the wishes of Black voters who consistently turn out for the party.\n\n\"To not choose her is a slap in the face to Black women,\" said Melanie Campbell, chair of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, an advocacy organization focused on Black voter engagement. \"You are saying to Black women that what we represent is not good enough -- not only to stay with the man we voted for, but the woman that most of us advocated for, to be the vice president. You take her down, then you lose the Black women's vote.\"\n\nWith Biden's future mired in uncertainty, the White House has continued to rely on Harris while the president self-isolated in Delaware with a case of COVID. She made an unscheduled appearance Friday afternoon at a newly opened ice cream shop in Washington owned by supermodel Tyra Banks, with her grandnieces in tow. Later, Harris held a call with major party donors at the request of Biden's senior advisers, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.\n\nAs Biden has pushed back defiantly on the calls for him to leave the race, he has leaned heavily on the support of Black and Hispanic lawmakers, effectively using their backing as a shield against calls for him to step down. His first meeting with lawmakers after the June 27 debate was a video meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus that turned into something of a pep rally, according to attendees.\n\nThis week, the White House invited members of CBC and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to travel with Biden on Air Force One to Las Vegas, and as the list of lawmakers calling for the president to step aside has grown longer, many Black and Hispanic leaders have fanned out across the country to defend his candidacy and legislative record.\n\nThe clear implication has been that calling on Biden to withdraw is counter to the wishes of a loyal and crucial part of the party base. But that tactic has not succeeded in tamping down on dissent.\n\nNow, with Democratic leaders and prominent lawmakers becoming more and more vocal about their view that Biden must exit the race, Black and Hispanic leaders have become more direct about their insistence that Harris is the only alternative.\n\nDuring a dinner of Congressional Black Caucus members this week in Las Vegas, Clyburn, who helped resurrect Biden's 2020 campaign, defended the Biden-Harris ticket and said choosing instead to hold an open contest for the nomination would not be good for the party, according to people present at the dinner.\n\n\"If anything does change from President Biden, the only option for us Democrats is to support Kamala Harris, period -- point blank, period,\" said Quentin James, co-founder of the Collective political action committee, which aims to help Black candidates seek elected positions and promotes voter outreach in minority communities.\n\nAimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization that supports women of color in politics, said she and other leaders of Democratic organizations have started conversations with delegates going to the Democratic National Convention next month to ensure that they would support Harris as the nominee should Biden step aside.\n\nProminent Democrats including Rep. Adam Schiff of California and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Allison said, \"should be as fervent, as clear, as strategic about unifying support behind the vice president with three and a half months out.\"\n\n\"Otherwise, they're deeply, deeply out of touch about how Democrats have won elections,\" she said. \"The calls for Biden to withdraw feel empty without a call for unity.\"\n\nSome members of Congress who have called on Biden to drop out -- an overwhelmingly white group -- have said explicitly that there should be an open primary to replace him.\n\n\"It's important to have a fair, open and democratic primary,\" said Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas, the first Democrat in Congress to urge the president to step aside. He stressed that Harris would be in a strong position but suggested it would be helpful for the party to demonstrate that \"this is not the product of a smoke-filled room or a handful of power brokers, but that there's genuine democracy here.\"\n\nMany Black and Hispanic Democrats are adamantly opposed to that. A group of leading Black Democrats circulated a letter Friday pushing back on the calls for Biden to bow out, but also making it clear that Harris must step in if he did.\n\n\"If -- and we stress if -- President Biden chooses not to run for a second term, we are clear that our choice is Vice President Harris,\" the letter said. \"We don't have to go and find a savior or great hope elsewhere,\" said the group, which includes a number of Black leaders in the Democratic Party. \"We already have it in our vice president.\"\n\nA separate public letter of support organized by Black women with more than 2,600 signatures as of Friday condemned the infighting in the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to support the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nPart of Biden's motivation to remain on the ticket is a long-held concern that he has a better chance of beating Trump than Harris, a view that may be at odds with recent polling comparing the two Democrats. In public, however, Biden has increasingly turned to Harris to energize Black voters.\n\nOn Tuesday at the NAACP National Convention in Las Vegas, the president drew his most enthusiastic response from a crowd of roughly 4,000 when he attacked Trump for his comment about \"Black jobs\" at the presidential debate -- and cited Harris.\n\n\"I know what a Black job is,\" Biden said to roaring applause. \"It's the vice president of the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But he has his doubts about whether voters would back Harris.\n\n\"Even in 2024, America is not ready for a Black, female president,\" he said, adding that he would support Harris. \"I think she's a pretty good politician but overall it boils down to race and gender. And America is going to hold that against her.\"\n\nBroadly speaking, Harris is well liked among Black voters, recent polls have shown, with large majorities approving of her job as vice president. The Biden campaign has deployed her where it believes her popularity is an asset, namely among younger voters and others concerned with abortion rights.\n\nSome voters said in interviews Sunday that Harris was battle-tested and ready.\n\nAntoine Marshall, 37, was playing video games at home with his three daughters when a friend texted him about Biden's decision to leave the race and support Harris.\n\n\"I didn't want him to run for a second term,\" said Marshall, an attorney in Raleigh, North Carolina, before citing Biden's pledge to be a transitional figure.\n\nBut the prospect of another Donald Trump presidency and what it could mean for African Americans was among Marshall's top concerns.\n\n\"The four years under Trump were bad, and I think people forget how bad they were,\" said Marshall.\n\nAt the point when it had seemed that Biden's candidacy was inevitable, Marshall had been on board, he said. He said those calling for Biden to drop out had not offered a path forward.\n\n\"I think a lot of people don't realize the lift that it's going to take to put somebody else at the top of the ticket,\" Marshall said.\n\nNow that Biden has stepped aside, he said, he believes Harris is the best option to step in. \"I do like Kamala Harris, and I do think that she needs to be the nominee, not just for logistical purposes, but because of her track record,\" Marshall said.\n\nIf the Democrats were to go with another nominee, he said, \"I don't know how you see it as anything other than a slap in the face of Black voters, Black women in particular.\"\n\nJohnson said he did envision one scenario in which Americans would elect a Black woman. He said he had watched Trump's political rise and concluded that his celebrity, more than anything else, gave him the edge he needed with voters.\n\nSo what Black woman could win? \"Oprah Winfrey,\" Johnson said.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_w_peters@seattletimes.com", "name": "Jeremy W.

Part of how that support manifested was through a massive influx of cash: Black women on that Zoom call raised $1.5 million dollars in three hours, according to Win With Black Women, the organization that convened the virtual gathering.\n\nBlack women have long been recognized as the most crucial voting bloc for the Democratic party. But experts say their role in contributing to Harris's record-breaking first 24 hours of fundraising -- when she raised raised more than $80 million, according to her campaign -- makes clear that Black women's political power goes far beyond party loyalty.\n\n\"Until yesterday, Black women weren't necessarily associated with being powerhouse fundraisers,\" Aimee Allison, founder and president of the organization She the People, told me. \"For Black women to raise money like that is evidence of Black women's political power in another way.\"\n\nMoney, Allison said, \"is the fuel of American politics -- and we can play there as well.\"\n\nWin With Black Women has been holding weekly, off-the-record Zoom calls for years to discuss Black women's political power, according to Allison and Glynda Carr, president, CEO and co-founder of the group Higher Heights for America, which works to elect progressive Black women to office. But the calls have never been as well attended as Sunday's, which had upwards of 40,000 listeners, according to organizers. Typically, the calls reach a maximum attendance of 1,000 people, according to Allison. (Spokespeople for Win With Black Women did not immediately respond to questions from Mother Jones on Monday.)\n\nBlack women played a major role in grassroots fundraising for former President Obama's campaign, Carr noted, adding that Black people also tend to donate a higher share of their wealth than white people do. Though Harris has already raked in a huge sum of cash, that kind of windfall is uncommon for Black women running for federal office, who research shows tend to have less cash on hand than other candidates. Of course, it's hard to make any comparison between Harris and other Black women candidates given that she would be the first woman of color ever to win the Democratic Party's nomination. This early financial support for Harris from Black women is notable, and shows that \"this is a growing space for Black women,\" Carr said.\n\nKelly Dittmar, director of research at Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics also sees it as \"symbolic of something more\": the \"support and enthusiasm\" crucial in powering Harris's candidacy to victory. \"If that type of organizing is already happening,\" Dittmar said, \"that bodes well for the Harris campaign.\"\n\nCarr's organization is already planning on how to capitalize on the enthusiasm for Harris's candidacy, she said, including by growing Higher Heights' network of Black women supporters in the coming months.\n\n\"There's a real opportunity to harnesses [Black women's fundraising] -- not just for Kamala Harris's presidency,\" Carr said, \"but candidates inspiring Black women's political spending up and down the ballot.\"", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mother Jones"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julianne_mcshane@motherjones.com", "name": "Julianne McShane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mother Jones (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimee_Allison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aimee Allison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots_fundraising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots fundraising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/kamala-harris-black-women-fundraising_2000.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Joyce Beatty predicted history on national television.\n\nDiscussing the news that President Joe Biden was ending his campaign and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the 2024 Democratic nominee for president, the Ohio Democrat dropped a casual mention on MSNBC that there would be a call later.\n\n\"As a Black woman, I'm going to join later tonight with so many Black women,\" Beatty said. \"It will probably be some 20,000 or 30,000 women trying to get on this call because it's personal for us and we stand with Vice President Harris.\"\n\nThe host was incredulous. \"Twenty or 30,000 you think will be on that phone call?\"\n\nEvery Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ET for the past four years, Black women have been virtually gathering, strategizing, encouraging and supporting one another through the collective Win With Black Women. The first call, with about 90 women -- from college students to grandmothers -- on August 2, 2020, was born out of frustration over the treatment of the Black women being considered as running mates for then-candidate Biden.\n\nOn Sunday, Black women surpassed Beatty's prediction: They were at least 44,000 strong on Zoom by the end of the more than four-hour convening that was a mass meeting, prayer circle and pep rally -- all with the goal of working to elect Harris the first woman president in 105 days. In further proof of the night's excitement, the group's goal to raise $1 million in 100 days was exceeded in just three hours, with more than $1.6 million raised.\n\nThe moment exists on a continuum of Black women's leadership, stretching back generations.\n\nIt was in the spirit of the work of mentors like veteran Democratic strategists Donna Brazile, the Rev. Leah Daughtry, Minyon Moore and Yolanda Caraway -- the pioneering force of Black women known as \"The Colored Girls\" who have worked more than three decades in national politics -- who encouraged a new generation of Black women leaders to take the baton and build the pipeline.\n\nFour years ago, Jotaka Eaddy was in her childhood home in South Carolina, fuming at the racist and misogynist treatment of women like Harris, Stacey Abrams, Karen Bass, Val Demings and others on the list of 2020 potential vice presidential picks. After watching a Facebook video from Daughtry railing about the discourse, she called Moore and asked, \"What are you gonna do, The Colored Girls?\"\n\nBut Moore challenged Eaddy and her peers right back: \"No, what are YOU gonna do?\"\n\nEaddy waited 20 minutes before picking up the phone again, this time typing in the email addresses of about 50 Black women from her various networks in politics, entertainment, Silicon Valley and activism. She sent a message with the subject line: \"Black Women - this VP narrative - Not on Our Watch.\"\n\n\"We know that we carry elections on our backs -- we have always done so and still are doing it today,\" Eaddy wrote. \"Now that we are demanding our rightful place at the table, this narrative that 'we are too much,' 'too ambitious,' 'rub people the wrong way' is BS ... We all know what is happening here and I am compelled to do whatever I can to speak out, organize and help stop it ... If not us, then who. If not now, then when.\"\n\nThere was an idea for a call the following day. Five months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the group gathered on Zoom. Women on the first call invited other women to join.\n\nIt was decided that they would write an open letter. Eaddy stayed up all night with other Black women writing. Eaddy sent the letter to the same email chain and within 48 hours, 3,000 women signed on.\n\nThey got their marching orders: to speak out against racism and sexism, to work to elect Black women, and to lift up the image and power of Black women and Black women-led organizations. They mobilized around Harris, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and WNBA player Brittney Griner. The group has included activists, elected officials and celebrities -- Oprah Winfrey; Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex; and the late Cicely Tyson have joined calls.\n\n\"I have always called this a collective love letter, from Black women to ourselves. And it belongs to all of us,\" Eaddy said.\n\nThe generational and geographic diversity was on display this week, along with a range of skills, talents and resources.\n\nBlack Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown Brown was at her family reunion on Sunday afternoon when she learned that Biden had endorsed Harris.\n\n\"I felt like when [Barack] Obama got the nomination all over again,\" Brown said. \"I actually felt more excited, to be honest. My first response was, 'OK, he's out; now we've got to fight for this sister.'\"\n\nBrown, who was on Sunday's call and sang a rousing rendition of the gospel staple \"I Don't Feel No Ways Tired,\" described it as \"the quintessential example of how Black women are fully supporting, organizing and investing\" in Harris' campaign in a show of what she summarized as strategy, strength and spirit.\n\n\"What you saw last night was clarity,\" Brown said. \"Black women are all in.\"\n\nBrown said her goal is to educate voters on Harris' record and promises and to prepare Black communities \"for the attacks that we know are coming.\"\n\n\"Our goal at this stage is to educate and motivate,\" Brown said. \"We got wind under our wings right now. We've got to fly. We've got to tap in.\"\n\nHarris' candidacy has energized Black men, too: On Monday night, they had their own six-hour convening, Win With Black Men, with more than 53,000 people on the call and raised $1.3 million, according to organizers.\n\n\"I got lots of texts [on Sunday night] and was seeing online a lot of Black men saying, 'I want to click this link, but I want to respect your space,'\" said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, an independent, Black-led grassroots organization that works to engage Black voters. \"We're heard this entire time that Black men won't support her, and we know that is just misogyny, to be clear. And it is misogyny not coming from Black men, but being directed at them.\"\n\nJara Butler, the chief impact officer of Supermajority, a progressive grassroots organization focused on building up the voting bloc of multiracial 18- to 35-year-old women, has been a part of the Win With Black Women group since its earliest days, when in 2020 a friend sent her the link and said, \"You probably want to be on this call.\" Being a part of this group has been \"transformative\" for her, she said, as she has gotten to hear regularly from Black women whom she had long admired.\n\nButler was laser focused on work after the news dropped Sunday, but when she got the notification for the call, she knew she had to join, and bring along others. Even with the intensity of the day and what it meant for her work, she thought, \"I've got to be with my sisters right now.\" She wanted that experience for others, too. \"I lead a staff that is made up predominantly of Black women, and I just encouraged them all to make sure they could be there.\"\n\nShe joined the call at 8:30 and shortly thereafter got an email notifying her that the call may not be able to continue because of technical difficulties occurring because too many people were trying to join. Then word spread that the call was going to be able to expand. And messages kept going out about just how significant that expansion was.\n\n\"It was like, 'This thing is getting bigger.' 'It's getting bigger.' 'It's getting bigger. 'It's getting bigger again.' 'We're going to have to change the format so everyone can be here.'\"\n\nNo one got frustrated by technical hiccups, Butler said.\n\n\"Everybody wanted to be there. We all needed an exhale from this moment and we needed to collectively feel hugged together. As I said on my own socials last night, if you felt the earth shift, it was because Black women were moving,\" She said. \"It wasn't just the 44,000 of us on that call who were there, but it was the spirit of our ancestors who were on there too.\"\n\nButler said the way she personally feels about Harris was very much reflected in the energy of the call, as well. \"As a Black woman, I have always looked up to Vice President Harris. In my first big corporate job, I had a picture of her in my cubicle.\"\n\nShropshire of BlackPAC said Biden stepping down brought \"a shift in energy.\"\n\n\"There was this sense of, 'OK, we can actually do this, and not just stumble across the finish line, which I think is what people were feeling before, but that we can do this and win -- and win big.'\"\n\nThe Win With Black Women call on Sunday night encapsulated this energetic change.\n\n\"I had folks texting me, friends who aren't political people, saying, 'Do you know anything about this call and do you have the link? I want to be there,'\" Shropshire said.\n\nAnd what attendees heard, she stressed, was \"sheer inspiration from Black women who have been a part of the Democratic Party process when the Democratic Party process didn't seem to care about Black people, and certainly didn't seem to care about Black women. We had folks like Donna Brazile on the call, sort of like our pastors, being very impassioned about what this means, what it can mean, what it has the potential to mean.\"\n\nShropshire said that the magnitude and energy of Sunday night's call reflects an infrastructure that exists among Black women that isn't just election-related, but reflects the reality of the reach and power of their networks.\n\n\"The women who were on that call represent professional networks. They represent sororities and fraternities. They represent churches,\" she said. \"It is the organic networks within Black communities that have always gotten things done, including massive social change efforts. These are the structures already in place upon which that call happened last night. And now these networks are going to be activated on steroids because we find ourselves in another historic moment.\"\n\nShe noted that fundamentally, the work of groups like BlackPAC is not set to change with Biden exiting the race and endorsing Harris in his stead. What is at play now, though, is replacing any ambivalence with hope.\n\n\"Now people feel like they have something to vote for, and not just against. We will have the opportunity over the next few days and weeks to begin to lift up the vice president and her story and her vision for America. We have an opportunity to lean into the historic nature of her race.\"\n\nIt also means mobilizing to be proactive against the inevitable misogyny and racism to come. Butler said she feels how Black women are ready to rally not just to get Harris elected, but to combat the misogynoir that is already coming her way.\n\n\"We've always been the workhorses but never been able to be the show horse. And now we're going to see how people feel about that, because there are people who are going to be uncomfortable with that,\" she said.\n\nEven still, Butler said, for now she only has \"contagious joy.\"\n\n\"My godsister called me and said, 'I've been on my prayer line since he made that announcement.' My 75-year old mama hasn't stopped wearing her Kamala shirt. My friends are excited. There is something palpable happening,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "advocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gay News, LGBT Rights, Politics, Entertainment"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minyon_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minyon Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Beatty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joyce Beatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stacey Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Demings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Val Demings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughtry_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daughtry (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leah_D._Daughtry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leah D.

The president, who dropped out of the 2024 race on Sunday, remained in Delaware as he recovered from COVID-19.\n\nHarris did not mention her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination; however, she delivered glowing praise for her boss and potential predecessor.\n\n\"Joe Biden's legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history,\" said Harris. \"In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office.\"\n\nHarris appeared to clear the Democratic presidential field on Monday as she racked up a major endorsement from former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Harris was also endorsed by former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Top Democratic governors who were expected to throw their names in the race also endorsed Harris, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nSenator Laphonza Butler, D-Calif., told theGrio that as the \"backbone of the Democratic Party,\" Black women are \"activated and excited\" about the potential nomination of Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n\"I think every one of us sees it as the opportunity of a lifetime. The opportunity to truly lift America to its next level of greatness,\" said Butler, a close ally of Harris and only the third Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"It is going to take Black women and suburban white women and Latinos and Asians and men of all stripes to achieve that objective ... And I think we are ready to lock arms and to choose to do it together.\"\n\nBut instead of focusing on using her first public remarks on Monday to boost her candidacy at the White House, Harris exalted President Biden for \"his honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family, his big heart and his ... deep love of our country.\"\n\nShe added, \"I am firsthand witness that every day our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people. And we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.\"\n\nIn an interview with theGrio, longtime Biden confidant U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., praised President Biden as having \"the most consequential record for Black people since [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson.\"\n\nCongressman Clyburn noted Biden's trillion-dollar infrastructure law, which is repairing roads and bridges in Black communities across the country, as well as his record of lowering health costs.\n\n\"Come January, there won't be a single person on Medicare that will pay more than $2,000 a year for their pharmaceuticals,\" he said. Clyburn also said millions more Black Americans now have health insurance through President Biden's efforts to expand the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMichael Blake, a former Obama White House aide, noted that as someone who did outreach to Black constituents, Biden proved that \"if you're focused on equity, accomplishments at scale overwhelmingly help Black folk.\"\n\n\"When you cap insulin, it helps Black folk. When you put more Black people -- and Black women in particular -- on the federal bench, it helps Black folk. When you focus on student loan forgiveness, it helps Black folk,\" said Blake, who is the founder and CEO of the Kairos Democracy Project.\n\nHe added, \"Joe Biden made it very clear that while he is not a Black man, he cared about Black people ... we owe him gratitude for his service to the country.\"\n\nSenator Butler said that by choosing to relinquish his pursuit of reelection and endorse Harris as the party's nominee, President Biden \"showed us yet another example of what true leadership is: someone who puts the country and other people ahead of their own personal ambitions or ego.\"\n\n\"This is a man who has dedicated his entire professional career, since he was 29 years old, to serving people,\" she told theGrio. \"His record as president, I think, will go down in history as one of the most generation-changing presidents.\"\n\nButler added, \"We've got to see this moment for President Biden as a moment of both gratitude and incredible admiration as well as aspiration. We all should aspire to be that type of leader.\"\n\nActivist Melanie L. Campbell, who led a letter signed by thousands of Black women urging Democrats not to push Biden off the Democratic Party's presidential ticket, told theGrio she found it \"heartbreaking that he was pushed to this decision.\" However, she added, \"I'm sure he made the decision that was best for him and his family.\"\n\n\"It's the most selfless thing I've ever seen in my life,\" said Campbell, chair of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund. She said as the current president and still the \"de facto\" leader of the party, Biden still has a role to play in \"helping to make sure that he helps this ticket get across the finish line.\"\n\nBlake, a former vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, said Biden's legacy is now forever tied to Harris and her historic campaign for president, which has raised $81 million in less than 24 hours.\n\n\"The country, and, overwhelmingly, Democrats are rallying behind a Black woman, who will be our nominee in a month in Chicago because Joe Biden made that decision,\" he maintained.\n\n\"The first Black president [Barack Obama] decided this is the man to be my vice president. [Biden] then decided to pick a Black woman to be his vice president,\" Blake noted. \"I feel very confident that when we get to November, we will have our first Black woman and first woman president. And the legacy of that through line is connected to Joe Biden.\"", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gerren_keith_gaynor@thegrio.com", "name": "Gerren Keith Gaynor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGrio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TheGrio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Blake_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Blake (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

I just don't believe Kamala Harris can. So, while it pains me to say it, I hope she will consider following Joe Biden's lead by putting the country first and stepping aside.\n\nMy family, some of whom agree with me on this, worried writing this column would disappoint other Black women who disagree. Those same Black women, however, will be hurt worse by the election of Donald Trump again. Despite her general favorability ratings being lower than Donald Trump's and four preceding vice presidents, I was still open to being convinced that Kamala Harris has a viable path to the presidency. Recent polling of Black voters, however, provided a much-needed reality check.\n\nA recent poll of Black voters in swing states found that Harris polls a couple of points better than Biden -- both landing in the 70s, behind former President Barack Obama, whose favorables stand at 90 percent and whose unfavorables are at 10 percent. The vice president's unfavorables among Black voters stand at 22 percent.\n\nJoe Biden Drops Out of 2024 Race and Endorses Kamala After 23-Minute Pause\n\nTo some that may sound insignificant, but when considering how close our last few elections have been, it's not. Consider this: In 2008 Obama won 95 percent of Black male voters and 96 percent of Black women. His next election he won 96 percent of Black women and 87 percent of Black men. Hillary Clinton's support among Black men slipped to 82 percent and her support among Black women to 94 percent. She lost. Black voters comprise approximately 25 percent of the Democratic voting bloc.\n\nThat means if a Democratic candidate doesn't knock it out of the park with Black voters, things turn pretty desperate pretty fast. For Kamala Harris, they already are. Like Hillary Clinton, Kamala is a known quantity, with sky-high name recognition. She also happens to be a Black woman. Why aren't her numbers higher? The truth is I've been asking versions of this question for a while.\n\nMy alarm bells first started ringing when during her disastrous run for the presidency in 2019, a number of older Black women, from varied backgrounds, told me they didn't like Kamala Harris. Some of their reasons struck me as underwhelming. She was described as \"arrogant.\" (OK, but plenty of men are too.)\n\nSome said she had relied on her looks to get ahead, a theory bolstered by President Obama referencing her good looks at a fundraiser. (OK, but if Gavin Newsom were short, and bald would he be governor?) I also heard plenty of, \"there's just something about her.\" After today's announcement, right-wing broadcaster Matt Walsh attacked Kamala in horrifying terms.\n\nWhen it comes to politicians and popularity, the unsaid is often more important than what is said. \"Something about her,\" is a favorite phrase reserved for women people simply don't like. It covers a lot of ground, including the possibility that a person simply reminds you of the girl from high school who made you feel small, even if she didn't mean to.\n\nRealizing their importance, Harris supporters are already focused on galvanizing Black female voters, with a planning and rousing morale-building call Sunday night, \"Win With Black Women,\" attended by an estimated 34,000 women.\n\nPersonally speaking, I've noticed that the women who seem to like Kamala most are women like me: I have a graduate degree, I am child-free by choice, and I admire bossy women, probably because every now and then I get called one myself. I don't consider any of these qualities bad things, but a lot of Americans do, including, apparently some women. If that weren't the case, Hillary Clinton would have become president.\n\nIf Kamala Harris comes across as the cocky homecoming queen, then Hillary was the know-it-all valedictorian who made others feel dumb. She first famously drew the ire of stay-at-home moms for defending her choice not to stay home baking cookies. Frankly, that made me like her more, but women like me are not the majority and Hillary Clinton didn't win the presidency and we were left Donald Trump, Part 1.\n\nIf Kamala Harris is the nominee I believe we will get to see Donald Trump, the sequel. Nothing would make me happier than to be proven wrong and for my friends who will hate this column to eventually tease me about how wrong I was. If I am right, however, and Kamala and her supporters, driven by their own desire to see history made, help elect Donald Trump, then Kamala's legacy will end up just as damaged as another feminist shero who didn't know when to exit stage left gracefully.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg and her fans allowed the cult of RBG to blind them from what was in the best interests of those she claimed to care about. By refusing to relinquish her power in a timely fashion she ultimately gave her power to conservatives. Now RBG's fans seemed poised to do it all over again.\n\nI'm already tired of this three-ring-circus of an election. I'm tired of living in perpetual terror about the future of our country, and I'm tired of arguing about the same politicians we have for the last decade, including Biden, Trump and yes, Kamala Harris. I'm also tired of trying to defend a woman that some people may not like because of racism, sexism and others simply because there is just something about her. The reasons people don't want to vote for someone don't have to make sense, but if those reasons are ingrained the only choice is to either accept losing their votes, or give them alternatives.\n\nWith that in mind, it's time to turn the page. Republicans did that brilliantly by choosing J.D. Vance, not simply because he's young but because he's not weighed down by the baggage all of these other old-school candidates (including Trump) seem to be carrying. In addition to male candidates like war veteran Jason Kander of Missouri, former Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, there are other Black and Asian women who represent the very best of our country's diverse leaders.\n\nVal Demings may have lost her Florida Senate race, but her law and order record, and credibility on crime would make her a viable contender. California senator Laphonza Butler's deep roots among organized labor would also make her a great addition to any ticket. Michelle Kwan's journey from trailblazing Olympian to ambassador and Sen. Tammy Duckworth's record as a veteran and role model for those with disabilities also make them candidates worthy of serious consideration.\n\nThere also those who I consider fantasy draft picks, like Ursula Burns, the first Black female Fortune 500 CEO and Mellody Hobson, who in addition to her own extraordinary business record, is telegenic, and has strong Hollywood ties that would make fundraising a cakewalk.\n\nThe bottom line is, I wish I had the luxury of convincing other Americans to like the people and politicians I do, but I don't. So if asking someone I admire to step aside will help save democracy, I'm willing to do it.\n\nI just hope Kamala Harris loves America as much as I do.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Convened by Win With Black Women, an intergenerational collective of Black women in business, entertainment, and technology, the invite purportedly went to the group's 4,000 members interested in supporting Harris.\n\nBut word spread about the invitation and it went viral, crashing the platform when the call began. By the time the restarted call ended a few hours later, some 40,000 women, and male allies, had joined the call -- and organizers had collected an impressive amount of money for a somewhat impromptu fundraiser.\n\n\"We made history together tonight and raised over $1.5 million in just 3 hours!\" the organization posted on its web page Monday. \"Have you given yet?\"\n\n\"We are united and fired up,\" Jotaka Eaddy, the group's founder, told theGrio. \"Ready to work to defeat Trump and his 2025 agenda and ensure that Vice President Harris is the next president of the United States!\"\n\nBy Monday morning, the meme, \"I was one of the 40,000,\" began showing up on social media, including on LinkedIn, X, and Facebook.\n\n\"I can't tell ya'll how much I needed this moment of sisterhood, solidarity, and community tonight,\" Naima Cochrane, an award-winning writer and music industry veteran, wrote on X.\n\n\"I feel poured into, I feel convicted, committed, reminded, encouraged, emboldened, loved on, lifted....,\"\n\nBiden's bombshell decision to drop out of the race kicked off a transformative 24 hours for Harris, the first woman of Black and South Asian descent -- and first HBCU grad and Black sorority member -- to serve as vice president. It upended a tight presidential race, thrust Harris into the spotlight, and made her the primary target for President Donald Trump.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the vice president had won a string of endorsements from influential political organizations that promote women, including Emily's List, the National Organization for Women, and the National Women's Political Caucus. She also won the endorsement of House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, perhaps the most powerful woman in political history, along with former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarris' campaign said it was the biggest single-day fundraising total in U.S. history.\n\nCombined with the $1.5 million raised by Win With Black Women, Harris took in $81 million -- a stunning total for a presidential campaign barely 24 hours old. It was by far the largest 24-hour amount either party has raised during this election cycle, and a sizable portion came from small-dollar, first-time donors; Harris' campaign said it was the biggest single-day fundraising total in U.S. history.\n\nAccording to several news outlets, the Win With Black Women call featured remarks from several Black women politicians, including Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas. Rep. Maxine Waters of California -- the first Black woman to chair the House Financial Services Committee -- also spoke at the event.\n\nWhile the endorsements have energized the Democratic Party, and the fundraising fueled hopes that she will be the first woman to occupy the Oval Office, there are some skeptics -- including many Black women. They want to see Harris succeed, but fear the country's history of racism and sexism will doom her campaign at the ballot box.\n\n\"As much as I would love to see Kamala become president, I just don't think it's going to happen,\" Kristy Smith of Atlanta, told The New York Times. \"America is just not ready for a woman president -- especially not a Black woman president.\"\n\nBut as Melissa Murray, a New York University law school professor wrote on X in response: \"Just a reminder. She's electable if we elect her.\"", "source": {"uri": "wordinblack.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Medium"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Moments later, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic nominee. Berg and her friends' normal 90-minute gathering lasted almost four hours.\n\n\"It generated so much spicy conversation,\" said Berg, who is Black, a Democrat and a Washington state House representative.\n\nBerg and millions of Black voters were pivotal to Biden's victory in 2020, especially in key swing states like Georgia. In his 2020 victory speech, Biden thanked Black voters and said he would do right by them. Throughout his presidency, Biden has touted his administration's accomplishments, like reducing child poverty, which particularly affects Black families, and appointing Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut while a majority of Black voters continued to back Biden, Black support for him had sagged overall. Now that he is no longer seeking re-election, Black people across the country interviewed by NBC News expressed various reactions to Biden's decision, from elation to disappointment to ambivalence. But they agreed that Biden had several meaningful accomplishments in office and that Harris would be a worthy choice to take his place at the top of the ticket.\n\nBiden's decision pleased Berg and the brunch crowd because they now see a path to defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nWith the pandemic and racial justice protests in 2020, Biden was \"the right man at the right moment,\" Berg said. \"And then he brought on Kamala Harris as his VP and at the announcement, she entered to Mary J. Blige's song 'Working.' I think most Black women, like me, felt very seen in that moment. And Joe Biden created that moment.\"\n\nShe and her friends were content with Biden's dropping out, she said, but not solely because of his meandering debate performance on June 27. \"I don't know that I could point to one specific thing that I would say, 'Oh, he needed to get out.' I just think overall, things had just changed after that night.\"\n\nLeslie Neland, an entrepreneur in Atlanta, said defeating Trump became more urgent when her 23-year-old son shared recently that he had been \"afraid and overly concerned\" when Trump was president. \"I deal with racism and move on. But when it impacts my son, it heightened for me the fact that this man cannot be president again,\" Neland said.\n\n\"Joe Biden has done a wonderful job for the country,\" she added, citing Biden's policies like the Child Tax Credit, which cut Black child poverty, and appointing more Black woman to be federal judges (38, including Brown Jackson) than any other president.\n\n\"And so much more, including amazing support of HBCUs and pulling us through Covid after Trump. So I'm a fan of Joe Biden,\" Neland added. \"It bothers me that so many Black people seem to not realize all that he has done.\"\n\nMaurice Hawkins, a political volunteer in Norfolk, Virginia, said some Black people were disenchanted with Biden because \"we are all exhausted by systemic racism. No one man can change hearts and minds. But Biden changed policies that benefit Black folks and set us on a promising path.\"\n\nBiden's rough debate performance in June led to mounting calls from Democratic figures for him to step aside. Christine Beatty, a nonprofit political consultant in Detroit, said it created a contentious situation.\n\n\"I think he was forced out, and I'm not happy about that,\" Beatty said. \"I think he succumbed to the pressure. The man tackled issues for the country, which are our issues. He brought down unemployment; jobs are our issues too, right? He saw us through the Covid crisis; that was our issue, too. He brought the economy back. That's our issue, too. There's no separation. The most critical issues in this country affect us, and they affect us the worst. So, he did a fantastic job. And he would have continued doing so.\"\n\nBeyond the 59 Black federal judges he nominated overall (men and women), Hawkins also noted Biden's other notable appointments, including Linda Thomas-Greenfield as the ambassador to the United Nations and Lloyd Austin as secretary of defense.\n\n\"He has one of the most diverse Cabinets in the history of the American presidency. And on policy, he's been fantastic,\" Hawkins said. A dedicated volunteer for the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020, Hawkins said he was \"saddened\" and \"disappointed\" to see Biden drop out.\n\nBut about a half-hour later, he learned Biden had endorsed Harris, and \"that uncertainty I had moved toward certainty and then excitement for the possibility of our country electing our first woman president, first African American woman president, first woman of Southeast Asian descent.\"\n\n\"So, you can't be happy to see someone like him go away,\" Hawkins said. \"But Kamala Harris is the next best thing.\"\n\nNeland, the entrepreneur in Atlanta, agreed with Biden's decision to back Harris \"because Kamala can beat Trump and that's the No. 1 goal -- not letting him back in power. Kamala Harris is capable and she's going to have the right people around her, not just like a one woman show.\"\n\nBeatty, who like Harris, is a Howard University graduate, said the vice president is the logical choice to continue Biden's work.\n\n\"Bringing in another candidate in, at this late time would cause way too much division within the Democratic Party,\" she said. \"You overstep the Black VP? You're going to have to make a case, and I don't think there's a case to be made. And as we know, Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party. When it's time to turn out and produce, that's what we do.\"\n\nThat path can be paved by Harris, said William Ratcliff, a retired project manager in suburban Phoenix, who also took issue with Biden seemingly being forced out.\n\n\"But, I see the strategy,\" he said. \"Kamala is younger, a fighter, smart and can energize the base, which, if we're being honest, was pretty blah before now.\"\n\nThat energy, he said, is necessary to defeat Trump.\n\n\"Because he's such a threat to democracy and decency, something had to happen to get us on a path to victory,\" Ratcliff said. \"Joe Biden did his job and did it well. Now it's up to the Democratic Party to throw their support behind Vice President Harris. If we finally come together as a party, we will be celebrating in November -- and not crying.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_J._Blige", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mary J.

It's about to run a person whose parents were immigrants against a xenophobe who supports mass deportations. It's about to run a woman who prosecuted sexual predators against a sexual predator who has been judged to be a rapist. And it's about to run a fierce defender of reproductive rights against a person who proudly claims responsibility for overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nAdd it all up, and what you get is that the Democrats are about to run the walking embodiment of what America is against the avenging specter of what America was.\n\nThe contrast between Vice President Kamala Harris and convicted felon Donald Trump could not be more clear, and that contrast should benefit Harris in every conceivable way. Harris is a person who wouldn't be allowed to finish her sentences in Trump's America, much less hold political and legal power. The distinction is now between a youthful, vibrant, and tolerant vision of the country, versus an aging, aggrieved, and absolutist version of America.\n\nDemocrats should be thrilled with the opportunity to run Donald Trump's worst nightmare against Donald Trump. And the base is. ActBlue, the small-dollar donations aggregator, smashed fundraising records on the first day of Harris's presidential campaign. Elder party poohbas and young rising Democratic stars all quickly endorsed Harris for president. \"Win With Black Women,\" a network of Black women grassroots organizers, had a call last night that broke Zoom, and ended up with over 40,000 participants who raised over a million dollars for Harris.\n\nThe contrast Harris provides to Trump is her greatest electoral asset, a thing that is energizing the very people Trump would harm the most -- but we, as a nation, are about to endure weeks and months of people telling us that it is her greatest weakness. The question \"Is America ready for a Black, female president?\" will be posed again and again by people who will claim that they already know the answer is \"no.\" Even as Harris consolidates the entire Democratic Party around her and her campaign, there will be people telling her she can't win because America won't elect a woman of color.\n\nAnd those naysayers will always be given a platform in The New York Times and other media outlets claiming they're simply reporting the facts. The Times won't cover Harris fairly even for a day, just to see what it would feel like, and they've already started down the road of making her seem unelectable because of her race and gender. For the first of what will be many hit pieces over the next few months, they used other Black people to make their point. A tortured Monday headline blared: \"Some Black Voters Say They Wonder if a Black Woman Can Win.\"\n\nBefore I dive into the article, I want you to step back and just marvel at the sheer meaninglessness of that headline. I, for instance, am a Black voter, and I wonder about a great many things. I wonder if aliens exist; I wonder if God is an asshole; I wonder how many abortions Donald Trump has paid for. But the Times wouldn't run a story that stated \"Some Black Voters Say They Wonder How Many Active Klu Klux Klan Members Attended the Republican National Convention\" -- even though I promise you that more Black voters wonder about that than Harris's electability. What the Times is doing here isn't journalism but confirmation bias: They wanted to run that kind of story and went out and found some people to say what they wanted them to say.\n\nAnd what those allegedly contemplative Black voters said was an all-too-standard refrain.\n\n\"It's kind of sad, but I don't think Harris will do well nationwide,\" said Kristy Smith, 42, who is from Atlanta and works in sales.\n\nAs a Black woman herself, Smith said she thinks Ms. Harris is entering the race with two strikes against her. \"America is just not ready for a woman president especially not a Black woman president,\" she said.\n\nIn fairness to Smith, she is merely repeating what this country has told Black people, and especially Black women, her whole life: America hates you. Every Black or brown person, and every woman, has direct evidence from their lived experience of just how deeply America hates them. It's palpable. We see the disdain this country holds for people of color whenever we turn on the news. We feel the antipathy this country holds for women every time we go to work, or read an opinion from the Supreme Court. Harris has been subjected to the worst press coverage of any vice president in my lifetime, and she's about to be subjected to the worst coverage of any presidential candidate in American history... save perhaps Hillary Clinton, who was the last woman who made it within striking distance of the presidency.\n\nThis is part of the very serious work of white male supremacy. It's not enough for white men to be in control of all the levers of power; they -- and those who do their bidding -- also have to make everybody else feel like they don't deserve power and won't be able to have any even if they try. The white guys who are determined to keep running this joint need the rest of us to believe that asking for equal opportunity and a fair shake is asking for too much, and that demanding equality now is perpetually too soon. Maybe someday a person like Kamala Harris could be president, but not today, never today; America is just not ready for all that right now.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActBlue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ActBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The virtual event featured a diverse group of Black female leaders, including politicians, activists, and spiritual figures, all coming together to back Harris's historic candidacy. The event conveyed a powerful message: Black women are not merely voters; they are pivotal players in the democratic process.\n\nThis demonstration of unity comes at a crucial time. As the country confronts issues like racial justice, economic disparity, and the integrity of democracy, the influence of Black women voters is more important than ever.\n\nThe success of the event underscores a fact that has long been evident: Black women are the cornerstone of the Democratic Party. The numbers are compelling -- 94% of Black women supported the Democratic nominee in 2016, and 90% backed the current administration in the last election. This steadfast support has been instrumental in numerous elections, yet it has not always been matched by proportional recognition or representation.\n\nSunday's virtual gathering was more than a fundraiser; it was a call for unity, strategic action, and the exercise of political power. Speakers drew inspiration from pioneers like Shirley Chisholm, emphasizing the long journey towards representation and the importance of seizing the current moment.\n\nThe event also highlighted the need for intersectional solidarity, with participants from Latino and Asian communities joining in support. This approach to coalition-building is vital in a diverse America, where the challenges facing one group often intersect with those of others.\n\nYet, with this influence comes responsibility. As Black women assert their political strength, they must also prepare for resistance. The call for a unified front to protect Vice President Kamala Harris from potential attacks underscores the often harsh realities of American politics, especially for women of color in leadership positions.\n\nThe remarkable fundraising total of over $1 million in just three hours is more than a financial achievement; it is a powerful statement. It shows that Black women are not only ready to vote but also willing to invest financially in candidates who represent their interests and aspirations.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the political engagement of Black women will undoubtedly be a decisive factor. Candidates and political parties would be wise to acknowledge and respect this power, not only during election campaigns but in their ongoing policies and platforms.\n\nPeople immediately took to X in the wake of the historic event. One user posted, \"40,000 people on the Win With Black Women call after Biden steps aside and endorsed VP Harris for the nomination. Wild.\"\n\nAnother one posted, \"Something mainstream media won't report: There was a Zoom tonight for Black women organizing for Kamala Harris. The call had a max of 1000 people. They hit it immediately, and got a hold of the Zoom CEO to help. 40,000 people joined. For over 4 hours. Trump is soooo screwed.\"\n\nThe #WinWithBlackWomen event has set a new benchmark for grassroots organizing and fundraising. It illustrates how communities can mobilize, using technology and a shared purpose to amplify their voices and exert their influence.\n\nIn the end, this movement is not just about one candidate or one election. It is about the ongoing fight for true representation as American democracy is on the line.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks, we'll see if VP Kamala Harris has enough support to secure the Democratic nomination.", "source": {"uri": "atlantadailyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Daily World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intersectionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Chisholm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Chisholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Women", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://atlantadailyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/shutterstock_1904609848-e1617799551524.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nOthers are concerned that if Biden were to be replaced, so would Harris, going against the will of many minorities in the party, who believe she is a vital leader and symbol of representation.\n\n\"I'm in these rooms; I see what they say in conversations,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, said during an Instagram livestream on Thursday night. \"A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president. They are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\nThe sense of urgency among Black and Latinx lawmakers and activists to defend Biden and Harris emerges from a pattern within those who have been calling for the president to step down, as many of them have been predominantly white representatives and an elite class of donors who don't necessarily back Harris or prioritize the concerns of minority voters.\n\n\"To not choose her is a slap in the face to Black women,\" Melanie Campbell, chairwoman of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, an advocacy organization focused on Black voter engagement, told The NY Times. \"You are saying to Black women that what we represent is not good enough -- not only to stay with the man we voted for, but the woman that most of us advocated for, to be the vice president.

The massive turnout helped dispel toxic myths about Black men's willingness to back a woman candidate.\n\nThe event was hosted by \"Win With Black Men,\" a collective of organizers modeled after \"Win With Black Women,\" the activist group that held its own, massive Zoom call to fundraise for Harris on Sunday.\n\nJournalist Roland Martin; activists Michael Blake, Khalil Thompson and Quentin James; and political commentator Bakari Sellers hosted the men's conference. Sellers gave a passionate endorsement of Harris while explaining how she was one of the first people to call him when his baby daughter was very ill.\n\nIn various corners of social media, there's been speculation -- fueled by social media chatter and, in part, by conservatives who are hardly authorities on Black voters -- that Black men will largely be averse to voting for Harris because she's a Black woman. Similarly offensive suggestions were made about Black men in Georgia's 2022 gubernatorial election when Stacey Abrams was on the ballot in a rematch against Republican incumbent Brian Kemp, but those speculations never came to fruition.\n\nAnd Monday was a powerful show of Black men's broad support for the Harris campaign. A \"Win With Black Men\" organizer reported more than 53,000 Black men joined the virtual event on Monday and raised $1.3 million in four hours. The organizers say half of that will go to the Harris campaign, and half will go to organizations that specialize in mobilizing Black men to vote. MSNBC hasn't independently verified the fundraising numbers. The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe energy surrounding the event was palpable enough to inspire organizers to commit to similar, pro-Harris conferences geared toward other demos -- like white women.\n\nThere was an array of speakers at this virtual conference, including actors Don Cheadle and Bill Bellamy; comedian Bill Bellamy; Democratic lawmakers Raphael Warnock, the senator from Georgia, and Maxwell Frost, the congressman from Florida; faith leaders Bishop William Barber, Pastor Jamal Bryant, and the Rev. Mark Thompson; Mayors Brandon Scott of Baltimore and Brandon Johnson of Chicago; as well as labor leaders and community organizers.\n\nBut the message was essentially the same from all of the speakers: They may be men, but they aren't MAGA men who want to be conscripted into Donald Trump's hypermasculine crusades. Speakers took turns bigging up Harris' leadership qualities, dispelling myths about Harris' prosecutorial record in California, encouraging Black men voters to reject racist and sexist attacks on Harris, and calling on viewers of the conference to reach out to other Black men who may feel disaffected by the political system and may be considering not voting.\n\nFor all the breathless talk in the media and online about Black men allegedly swinging in Trump's favor this election cycle, Monday's meetup underscored the political reality: There are many Black men -- like there are many Black women -- firmly in Harris' corner. And they're putting their money where their mouth is, adding what's already been a massive fundraising haul for Harris in the first few days of her campaign.\n\nYou can check out a full video with all

The call would exceed viewership levels from the first minutes, prompting Martin to also stream the event live via YouTube. The final numbers were staggering, as revealed in a post by Martin to X, formerly Twitter on Tuesday (July 23): \"I have no words. And not just because I'm tired. My @BlkStarNetwork just told me that 53,862 people registered for our #WinWithBlackMen video call. We raised $1.3M and counting from 17,000 donors.\"\n\nThe call featured numerous guests, including Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock. \"This moment will go down in history when the brothers got together to say we are all in for the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris,\" Warnock said. \"It is time to show up not just for Kamala Harris but our families and future.\" Bakari Sellers spoke to those gathered, sharing a deeply personal story about how Harris helped him in a dark time. \"Let's protect Kamala. Let's be with her like she was there for us,\" Sellers said. \"We are going to disagree a lot. But let's put the petty bickering aside. Let's stand up and be the Black men who change this country. We built this country. I'm rocking with Kamala.\"\n\nThe \"Win With Black Men\" call came a day after the Win With Black Women advocacy group held a call on Sunday night (July 21). That call drew 44,000 women supporters and raised $1.5 million for Harris' campaign in only a few hours.\n\nThe call is significant because of the focus on the voting power of Black men - a survey held in May by the Pew Research Center showed an uptick in Black men who said they'd vote for Donald Trump over President Biden in the November elections at 20%. The Biden-Harris ticket did capture 92% of the vote in the 2020 elections. Throughout the chat, the emphasis on voting and voter outreach was emphasized by every speaker, including the Reverend William Barber. \"Let's reach out to those brothers everywhere and lift up a mighty transformative remnant of voters who can change the direction of this nation,\" he said, imploring those present to engage those Black men not on the call.\n\nThousands of Black Men Rally For VP Kamala Harris On Zoom Call, Raise Over $1M was originally published on hiphopwired.com", "source": {"uri": "theurbandaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Urban Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@theurbandaily.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Martin_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roland Martin (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakari_Sellers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bakari Sellers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/07/17217666055954.jpg?w=640&strip=all&quality=85", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 179, "textEnd": 186}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 606, "textEnd": 613}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 1638, "textEnd": 1645}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

In what was intended as a determined show of grassroots support for a campaign to put a Black woman in the White House, that number quickly became 40,000.\n\nThey spent four hours voicing their unwavering support for Harris - sharing personal stories about working with her, surfacing her leadership qualities and underlining her unimpeachable qualifications for the role of US president. Before she rose to the vice-presidency under Biden, Harris had been the first African-American woman and south Asian American woman to serve as the attorney-general of California (though not without controversy - more on that later).\n\nNews that Biden had endorsed her as his successor sparked an immediate surge in Democrat fundraising, the kind of which had so far been lacking from the election. During the Zoom call, more than a million dollars was raised in donations to what is now the \"Harris for president\" campaign. Almost $50m (\u00a338.7m) rolled in over the hours that followed. (By comparison, in the 24 hours after Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records, his presidential campaign raised $52.8m from small-time donors in a fundraising blitz.)\n\nIt's a sign of support for Harris - but also a determination that the alternative cannot be allowed to happen. After Trump and the racist, misogynistic views he espouses made it all the way to the White House, Black women decided to mobilise. The slogan \"Listen to Black women\" was coined. Sunday's Zoom was \"Listen to Black women\" brought to life.\n\nIf only it had happened half a decade ago. As Black women have long pointed out, Trump's election win in 2016 was enabled by millions of white women voting not for Hillary Clinton, but for a \"p****-grabbing\" man whose policy positions were a clear threat to women's rights.\n\nBlack women occupy a unique space within American society. At the intersection of both race and gender, they have a uniquely rounded worldview, which offers them a perspective that is unmatched by anyone else.\n\nOne of the phrases Harris likes to use, but which has puzzled many as to its meaning - \"What can be, unburdened by what has been\" - has taken on a new clarity after her sudden elevation to the Democratic nomination. Her appeal is to a core of Black and Hispanic voters, and women in particular, who can see in Harris how America, a country stained by its long history of racism and slavery, is changing.\n\nSo, too, is the US electorate itself. Since the 2020 election, half of the growth of the voting-age population has been within the Hispanic-American community. Black women still largely identify with the Democratic Party, but increasingly less devotedly. Were Harris to win the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, that base would become immovable.\n\nShe has younger generations on her side. Like Barack Obama before her, she has enough swag to win over those with huge, influential fanbases: Ariana Grande, Demi Lovato and John Legend have already taken to social media to let their millions of followers know they are right behind her. British singer Charli XCX, despite not being able to vote in the US election, has also already heavily endorsed her, declaring on social media that \"Kamala is brat\" - which has only added to Harris's cred and seemingly created another Harris internet meme.\n\nA Harris nomination will not be without its controversies for the Black community. During her tenure as prosecutor in California, she was heavily criticised for the mass incarcerations she oversaw, which had a huge impact on the Black community in particular. She convicted almost 2,000 for cannabis violations, sending many to prison - but when asked if she ever smoked herself, she gives her trademark laughs. A mosaic has been made of Harris using the faces of all the Black men she locked up, some of whom were kept well past their release dates.\n\nIt is not yet clear who Harris will choose as her running mate. I've seen some commentators suggest that she would do well to choose Bernie Sanders. He has a ready fan base and left-wing credentials that Harris simply doesn't have. But, like Biden, he is of advancing years which may count against him, even though he's distinctly more lucid. Others believe that she needs to choose someone more moderate, perhaps someone with a military background who would play well in the Midwest and perhaps even win over the Bible belt.\n\nOne thing is for sure. If she picks the right running mate, she'll be laughing all the way to the White House.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [],

Clyburn of South Carolina, \"ridin' with Biden\" no matter what.\n\nThat powerful defense, though, has not been driven solely by a yearning for a second term of the Biden presidency, according to interviews with dozens of them over the past week. It is also born of a palpable fear among many Black and Hispanic Democrats that in their rush to ditch Mr. Biden, some in the party will also seek to skip over Ms. Harris, throwing open the nominating process in a way that would defy the will of their communities.\n\n\"I'm in these rooms; I see what they say in conversations,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, said during a social media stream on Thursday night. \"A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president. They are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\nPublic support for Mr. Biden to stay in the race is not unanimous among Black and Hispanic members of Congress.\n\nIn recent days, at least a half-dozen of them have called for Mr. Biden to step aside or have expressed grave concerns about his ability to win in November. They include Representatives Marc Veasey of Texas, Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico and Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva of Arizona.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" Mr. Veasey wrote in a letter joined by three other lawmakers, not all of whom were Black or Hispanic.\n\n\"It is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" they wrote on Friday.\n\nOne of the factors prolonging what has been an agonizing period of reckoning among Democrats about Mr. Biden's fate is a racial divide on the future of their party, and who should have the greatest say in what it looks like.\n\nBlack lawmakers and voters have long been a core of his base. Veteran Black and Hispanic lawmakers have celebrated Mr. Biden's domestic agenda as delivering for their constituents.\n\nStill, Mr. Biden's support has slipped among the rank and file. Black voters remain among his strongest backers, but were about evenly divided on whether Mr. Biden should stay in the race in a recent AP-NORC poll. And Republicans have made inroads among Black and Latino voters since the 2020 election, polling suggests.\n\nUnderlying the sense of urgency among many Black lawmakers and activists to defend the president is a feeling that those pushing the hardest for Mr. Biden to go are predominantly white lawmakers and an elite class of donors who do not necessarily back Ms. Harris and are not prioritizing the wishes of Black voters who consistently turn out for the party.\n\n\"To not choose her is a slap in the face to Black women,\" said Melanie Campbell, chairwoman of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, an advocacy organization focused on Black voter engagement. \"You are saying to Black women that what we represent is not good enough -- not only to stay with the man we voted for, but the woman that most of us advocated for, to be the vice president. You take her down, then you lose the Black women's vote.\"\n\nWith Mr. Biden's future mired in uncertainty, the White House has continued to rely on Ms. Harris while the president self-isolated in Delaware with a case of Covid. She made an unscheduled appearance Friday afternoon at a newly opened ice cream shop in Washington owned by the supermodel Tyra Banks, with her grandnieces in tow. Later, Ms. Harris held a call with major party donors at the request of Mr. Biden's senior advisers, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.\n\nAs Mr. Biden has pushed back defiantly on the calls for him to leave the race, he has leaned heavily on the support of Black and Hispanic lawmakers, effectively using their backing as a shield against calls for him to step down. His first meeting with lawmakers after the June 27 debate was a video meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus that turned into something of a pep rally, according to attendees.\n\nThis week, the White House invited members of C.B.C. and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to travel with Mr. Biden on Air Force One to Las Vegas, and as the list of lawmakers calling for the president to step aside has grown longer, many Black and Hispanic leaders have fanned out across the country to defend his candidacy and legislative record.\n\nThe clear implication has been that calling on Mr. Biden to withdraw is counter to the wishes of a loyal and crucial part of the party base. But that tactic has not succeeded in tamping down on dissent.\n\nNow, with Democratic leaders and prominent lawmakers becoming more and more vocal about their view that Mr. Biden must exit the race, many Black and Hispanic leaders have become more direct about their insistence that Ms. Harris is the only alternative.\n\nDuring a dinner of Congressional Black Caucus members this week in Las Vegas, Mr. Clyburn, who helped resurrect Mr. Biden's 2020 campaign, defended the Biden-Harris ticket and said choosing instead to hold an open contest for the nomination would not be good for the party, according to people present at the dinner.\n\n\"If anything does change from President Biden, the only option for us Democrats is to support Kamala Harris, period -- point blank, period,\" said Quentin James, co-founder of the Collective PAC, which aims to help Black candidates seek elected positions and promotes voter outreach in minority communities.\n\nAimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization that supports women of color in politics, said she and other leaders of Democratic organizations have started conversations with delegates going to the Democratic National Convention next month to ensure that they would support Ms. Harris as the nominee should Mr. Biden step aside.\n\nProminent Democrats like Representative Adam B. Schiff of California and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms. Allison said, \"should be as fervent, as clear, as strategic about unifying support behind the vice president with three and a half months out.\"\n\n\"Otherwise, they're deeply, deeply out of touch about how Democrats have won elections,\" she said. \"The calls for Biden to withdraw feel empty without a call for unity.\"\n\nSome of the members of Congress who have called on Mr. Biden to drop out -- an overwhelmingly white group -- have said explicitly that there should be an open primary to replace him.\n\n\"It's important to have a fair, open and democratic primary,\" said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, the first Democrat in Congress to urge the president to step aside. He stressed that Ms. Harris would be in a strong position but suggested it would be helpful for the party to demonstrate that \"this is not the product of a smoke-filled room or a handful of power brokers, but that there's genuine democracy here.\"\n\nMany Black and Hispanic Democrats are adamantly opposed to that. A group of leading Black Democrats circulated a letter on Friday pushing back on the calls for Mr. Biden to bow out, but also making it clear that Mr. Harris must step in if he did.\n\n\"If -- and we stress if -- President Biden chooses not to run for a second term, we are clear that our choice is Vice President Harris,\" the letter said. \"We don't have to go and find a savior or great hope elsewhere,\" said the group, which includes a number of Black leaders in the Democratic Party. \"We already have it in our vice president.\"\n\nA separate public letter of support organized by Black women with more than 2,600 signatures as of Friday condemned the infighting in the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to support the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nPart of Mr. Biden's motivation to remain on the ticket is a long-held concern that he has a better chance of beating Mr. Trump than Ms. Harris, a view that may be at odds with recent polling comparing the two Democrats. In public, however, Mr. Biden has increasingly turned to Ms. Harris to energize Black voters.\n\nOn Tuesday at the N.A.A.C.P. National Convention in Las Vegas, the president drew his most enthusiastic response a crowd of roughly 4,000 when he attacked Mr. Trump for his comment about \"Black jobs\" at the presidential debate -- and cited Ms. Harris.\n\n\"I know what a Black job is,\" Mr. Biden said to roaring applause. \"It's the vice president of the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news",

Moments later, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him as the Democratic nominee. Berg and her friends' normal 90-minute gathering lasted almost four hours.\n\n\"It generated so much spicy conversation,\" said Berg, who is Black, a Democrat and a Washington state House representative.\n\nBerg and millions of Black voters were pivotal to Biden's victory in 2020, especially in key swing states like Georgia. In his 2020 victory speech, Biden thanked Black voters and said he would do right by them. Throughout his presidency, Biden has touted his administration's accomplishments, like reducing child poverty, which particularly affects Black families, and appointing Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut while a majority of Black voters continued to back Biden, Black support for him had sagged overall. Now that he is no longer seeking re-election, Black people across the country interviewed by NBC News expressed various reactions to Biden's decision, from elation to disappointment to ambivalence. But they agreed that Biden had several meaningful accomplishments in office and that Harris would be a worthy choice to take his place at the top of the ticket.\n\nBiden's decision pleased Berg and the brunch crowd because they now see a path to defeating Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nWith the pandemic and racial justice protests in 2020, Biden was \"the right man at the right moment,\" Berg said. \"And then he brought on Kamala Harris as his VP and at the announcement, she entered to Mary J. Blige's song 'Working.' I think most Black women, like me, felt very seen in that moment. And Joe Biden created that moment.\"\n\nShe and her friends were content with Biden's dropping out, she said, but not solely because of his meandering debate performance on June 27. \"I don't know that I could point to one specific thing that I would say, 'Oh, he needed to get out.' I just think overall, things had just changed after that night.\"\n\nLeslie Neland, an entrepreneur in Atlanta, said defeating Trump became more urgent when her 23-year-old son shared recently that he had been \"afraid and overly concerned\" when Trump was president. \"I deal with racism and move on. But when it impacts my son, it heightened for me the fact that this man cannot be president again,\" Neland said.\n\n\"Joe Biden has done a wonderful job for the country,\" she added, citing Biden's policies like the Child Tax Credit, which cut Black child poverty, and appointing more Black woman to be federal judges (38, including Brown Jackson) than any other president.\n\n\"And so much more, including amazing support of HBCUs and pulling us through Covid after Trump. So I'm a fan of Joe Biden,\" Neland added. \"It bothers me that so many Black people seem to not realize all that he has done.\"\n\nMaurice Hawkins, a political volunteer in Norfolk, Virginia, said some Black people were disenchanted with Biden because \"we are all exhausted by systemic racism. No one man can change hearts and minds. But Biden changed policies that benefit Black folks and set us on a promising path.\"\n\nBiden's rough debate performance in June led to mounting calls from Democratic figures for him to step aside. Christine Beatty, a nonprofit political consultant in Detroit, said it created a contentious situation.\n\n\"I think he was forced out, and I'm not happy about that,\" Beatty said. \"I think he succumbed to the pressure. The man tackled issues for the country, which are our issues. He brought down unemployment; jobs are our issues too, right? He saw us through the Covid crisis; that was our issue, too. He brought the economy back. That's our issue, too. There's no separation. The most critical issues in this country affect us, and they affect us the worst. So, he did a fantastic job. And he would have continued doing so.\"\n\nBeyond the 59 Black federal judges he nominated overall (men and women), Hawkins also noted Biden's other notable appointments, including Linda Thomas-Greenfield as the ambassador to the United Nations and Lloyd Austin as secretary of defense.\n\n\"He has one of the most diverse Cabinets in the history of the American presidency. And on policy, he's been fantastic,\" Hawkins said. A dedicated volunteer for the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020, Hawkins said he was \"saddened\" and \"disappointed\" to see Biden drop out.\n\nBut about a half-hour later, he learned Biden had endorsed Harris, and \"that uncertainty I had moved toward certainty and then excitement for the possibility of our country electing our first woman president, first African American woman president, first woman of Southeast Asian descent.\"\n\n\"So, you can't be happy to see someone like him go away,\" Hawkins said. \"But Kamala Harris is the next best thing.\"\n\nNeland, the entrepreneur in Atlanta, agreed with Biden's decision to back Harris \"because Kamala can beat Trump and that's the No. 1 goal -- not letting him back in power. Kamala Harris is capable and she's going to have the right people around her, not just like a one woman show.\"\n\nBeatty, who like Harris, is a Howard University graduate, said the vice president is the logical choice to continue Biden's work.\n\n\"Bringing in another candidate in, at this late time would cause way too much division within the Democratic Party,\" she said. \"You overstep the Black VP? You're going to have to make a case, and I don't think there's a case to be made. And as we know, Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party. When it's time to turn out and produce, that's what we do.\"\n\nThat path can be paved by Harris, said William Ratcliff, a retired project manager in suburban Phoenix, who also took issue with Biden seemingly being forced out.\n\n\"But, I see the strategy,\" he said. \"Kamala is younger, a fighter, smart and can energize the base, which, if we're being honest, was pretty blah before now.\"\n\nThat energy, he said, is necessary to defeat Trump.\n\n\"Because he's such a threat to democracy and decency, something had to happen to get us on a path to victory,\" Ratcliff said. \"Joe Biden did his job and did it well. Now it's up to the Democratic Party to throw their support behind Vice President Harris. If we finally come together as a party, we will be celebrating in November -- and not crying.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_J._Blige", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mary J.

Within hours, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee, with other party leaders and, crucially, state delegations pledging their support for her as well. By Monday morning, news had broken of an astonishing organizing effort: That same Sunday night, 40,000 Black women had met on Zoom and raised $1.5 million for Harris in under four hours.\n\nThis was the work of #WinWithBlackWomen, an advocacy group started in 2020. Bazaar spoke with founder Jotaka Eaddy, a former NAACP official with ties to the political, tech, and entertainment industries. She told us how this moment of nimble organizing came to be.\n\nIt took the heart and soul of a lot of dedicated Black women. We're very grateful to the team at Zoom and the engineers at Zoom that worked with us to help us very quickly expand our capabilities to host so many people that wanted to be in coalition.\n\nWe have been meeting most Sunday nights since August of 2020. It's a full-circle moment, because we started almost four years ago. We are a network of Black women leaders. We represent every single facet of Black women. We're Black women in Silicon Valley and business and corporate and movement work, and we are elected officials. We all come in our personal capacities.\n\nWe originally came together out of our collective concern around the racism and sexism that surrounded who was going to be the vice presidential nominee (in 2020). On August 1, 2020, it was 90 women...from that, the network grew to well over 5,000 Black women leaders.\n\nAnd then we went on. We organized around the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. We've also followed the lead of one of the networks we work with, the WNBA players association, around the open letter that we had published calling for the deal to bring Brittney Griner home. We did 100 theater buyouts for The Little Mermaid, Origin, The Color Purple.\n\nWe meet most Sunday nights. It's always been a thing, this kind of underground, 'if you know, you know' thing. Black women would walk up to me or others at the airport and say, \"I'm on the Sunday calls.\"\n\nMiss Oprah Winfrey joined our call in the past. We've had almost every Black woman that has run for office join these calls -- [from basketball coach] Dawn Staley to the late, great Miss Cicely Tyson.\n\nWe had that momentum, and we were planning to meet on Sunday regardless. We got the news and then we very quickly shifted our agenda. Anywhere from 500 to 1,000 women on a call quickly ballooned to 44,000 on Zoom.\n\nOh, my sister, let me tell you, you are so right about that. I come from the school of understanding political strategy and organizing from the Colored Girls. The Colored Girls are Donna Brazile, Minyon Moore, Leah Daughtry, and Yolanda Caraway. It's important to say these names. And the women who taught them were C. Delores Tucker, Dr. Dorothy Irene Height, Betty Shabazz. They passed that on to us.\n\nWhat we have learned is that relationships matter. [All of this] was born out of relationships of Black women who knew each other, who had been working together, and -- this part is important -- who love and respect each other. The fact that it has lasted for so long is because it is a collective space. It belongs not to me; it belongs to all of us as Black women.\n\nWe have been seeing this moment because we knew it would come. We're ready for it, and and we have a plan. We've been working and we're ready to get into high-gear work.\n\nThere is a strong contingent of Black women tech leaders, Asian-American tech leaders, some of whom have led some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley, who are all calling and texting me saying: \"Let's go. We are so excited. I'm ready to max out. Where's the donation link? What can I do? Sign me up. How can I help?\" There are also a lot of other voices -- Asian-American men, white men in tech, that are deeply enthusiastic about Kamala Harris.\n\nI believe that when it's all said and done, there are gonna be a lot [of people] who will deeply have regretted some of their decision to be so close to such a vile derogatory individual [Trump], that has made very clear his intention to tear down our democracy.\n\nI love and know those brothers that organized that call. We've been talking to them for many months now. They raised over a million dollars last night.\n\nI think it's important to note that the polls don't talk to everybody. I think we ought to be very wary of polls. We learned that in the unfortunate lesson in previous presidential cycles.\n\nWhat we need to pay attention to is the energy that's on the ground, the work that's happening on the ground. There were more than 20,000 Black men on that call. Black men are organizing; Black men are having conversations amongst themselves in their community. That's important. We've got to pay attention to that and not the rhetoric. When you go down to the root of it, when you look at the policies of President Biden and Vice President Harris in their administration, the reality of their record, how it has impacted Black men and all people and what their record will continue to do...it's a very clear line about the benefit of a Kamala Harris presidency.\n\nBlack men are going to vote not only their values and their principles, but they're also gonna vote [in response to the question] \"What is in the best interest for themselves?\" And their families.\n\nIt's also important to note that we're now hearing from Asian-American women, white women, saying, \"Hey, we need to get a call.\" Very much like the Black women and the Back men around Kamala Harris. I'm seeing now someone saying we need to win with young people. Now I'm like: Let's just do a big joint call. I'm gonna reach out to Zoom and say, \"How many people can we really hold?\"\n\nWhat started in earnest four years ago to speak out [against] this racism and sexism is now turned into a movement, a positive movement where we feel joy.

Sellers, a former South Carolina politician and current CNN political commentator has told the story before.\n\nBut on Monday night on a Zoom call with more than 20,000 Black men, he couldn't stop the tears from coming down recounting how his wife and daughter are now well and thriving and about the support he got during that ordeal.\n\n\"I will never forget, the first person to call me...,\" he said, pausing for 20 seconds to get the words out. \" ... was Kamala Harris. I am not sure people understand the pain and suffering that goes along with being a Black man in this country. I am not sure people understand what it means to stand strong in this country. To have your back against the wall. But I am going to stand with her because she stood with me, during my darkest moment when I almost lost my daughter. When I had to protect my wife.\"\n\nSellers said now it was his time to protect Vice President Harris, and an army of Black men agreed.\n\nOn Sunday, as he announced that he would not seek reelection, President Joe Biden endorsed Harris to replace him at the top of the Democratic Party's ticket for the November election. If elected, she would be the first woman and first African American woman to serve as President of the United States.\n\nOn Monday night, journalist Roland Martin hosted the online gathering aimed at energizing Black males to get them to the polls, open up their wallets, and get on the streets to campaign for Harris.\n\nMore than 21,000 men registered for the \"Win with Black Men,\" streaming meeting. Those who couldn't get in watched on YouTube and Facebook as a list of prominent Black male politicians, community leaders, organizers, and celebrities turned their cameras on to tell their stories and support Harris, including Sen. Raphael Warnock and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens.\n\n\"This moment will go down in history when the brothers got together to say we are all in for the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris,\" Warnock said. \"It is time to show up not just for Kamala Harris, but our families and future.\"\n\nCalling former President Donald Trump a \"plague on the American consciousness,\" and an \"existential threat to democracy,\" Warnock told the men that they would be needed to help Harris stop him from regaining the White House.\n\n\"Don't let anybody slow us down asking the question 'Can a Black woman be elected president of the United States,'\" Warnock said. \"Kamala Harris can win. We just have to show up. History is watching us, and the future is waiting on us.\"\n\nDickens told the men that Atlanta was excited about supporting Harris, adding that money and support were already rolling in.\n\n\"The victories that we got for Joe Biden, Raphael Warnock, and Jon Ossoff is going to happen again for Kamala Harris,\" Dickens said. \"We are fired up. Now it is time to raise the money, get the volunteers, and go forward. Let's keep this thing going. No doubt. No fear.\"\n\nThe meeting of men followed a Sunday night Zoom meeting organized by the political advocacy group Win with Black Women that drew 44,000 women and raised over $1.5 million for the Harris campaign in just a few hours.\n\nWithin the first 20 minutes of Monday's call, Martin said the men had already raised $130,000 in their quest to raise more than $1.5 million.\n\nWithin a half hour, that number had risen to $500,000. Martin said the money will go to the Harris campaign, as well as to grassroots organizations run by Black men in battleground states.\n\n\"When we mobilize, we win. We move mountains,\" said Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, whose name has been mentioned as a potential vice-presidential nominee. \"For Kamala Harris, who has stood by us, lifted us up, and supported us, it is important that she knows that she has an army behind her.\"\n\nBlack men were always going to be the wild card.\n\nWhile the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket won 92% of Black voters in 2020, a May survey from Pew Research Center showed that 20% of Black men said they would have supported former President Donald Trump over Biden in November.\n\nOrganizers are hoping that meetings like Monday's, as well as excitement around Harris, could stem a tide that is suggesting that the Republican Party and Trump are stealing voters who have long been entrenched in the Democratic Party's camp.\n\nAccording to exit polls, Trump won about 12% support from Black men in 2020 and a recent Pew Research Center report showed a slight uptick in Black men who identify as Republican in 2024 compared to four years ago.\n\n\"We have 106 days to make sure that Black men are part of this journey,\" said Michael Blake, founder and CEO of Kairos Democracy Project. \"We have 106 days to remind the country that you cannot make progress without Black men.\"\n\nWearing a \"Defend Democracy\" T-shirt, National Urban League President Marc Morial scoffed at the notion that Harris was not qualified for the White House, a narrative that was circulating through conservative media on Monday. He also said it was not a time to consider not voting.\n\n\"We will not unilaterally disarm. We will not disrespect our ancestors and surrender our power by not voting,\" Morial said. \"The stakes are clear. Trump is shaking in his boots. He will do anything and everything to not debate Harris. Because he knows she will call him out for all of his transgressions and illegal and misogynistic activities. We must light a flame under our community and build a huge coalition to make this a historic win in November.\"\n\nDespite the seriousness of the occasion, the men on the meeting had fun teasing each other. Martin, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., mentioned everyone's organization or college when they spoke.\n\nBefore running to the bathroom, Martin playfully yelled at a former White House communications official who could not figure out how to unmute himself.\n\nBut among the elite class of Black men, the Rev. William Barber of Repairers of the Breach challenged everyone on the call to remember the often forgotten Black men who could not make the call. The ones in the barbershops or digging ditches.\n\n\"Let's reach out to those brothers everywhere and lift up a mighty transformative remnant of voters who can change the direction of this nation,\" Barber said.\n\nAt 10:50 p.m., the call was still going on.\n\nQuentin James, one of the organizers and the president of the Collective Pac and Vote to Live Action Fund, announced that Harris had secured enough delegates to assure that she would be the Democratic Party's official nominee.\n\nHe also announced that 16,000 men had donated $1.2 million.\n\nA whole list of speakers, including Democratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison and writer Michael Eric Dyson, were still waiting to speak.\n\nMore money, at least more than the women, was still waiting to be raised for Harris.\n\n\"Let's protect Kamala. Let's be with her like she was there for us,\" Sellers said. \"We are going to disagree a lot. But let's put the petty bickering aside. Let's stand up and be the Black men who change this country. We built this country. I'm rocking with Kamala.\"", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "atlanta_journal_constitution@myrtlebeachonline.com",

Win With Black Women organizers connected with Aparna Bawa, the COO of Zoom for support, and soon the floodgates opened as women and allies from across the country joined to strategize about how to support Harris' run for president.\n\nWin With Black Women is an intergenerational women's group that has rallied support for Black women in politics, with a particular focus on getting Black women appointed to senior positions in the Biden-Harris administration. The group played a role in persuading President Joe Biden to select Harris as his vice presidential nominee in 2020.\n\nWhile the Sunday night call itself was off the record, for many attendees, the assignment was clear: Get in formation and rally voter support for Harris by Election Day, Nov. 5. The stakes could not be higher, as evidenced by former president and current GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump's immediate lobbing of attacks toward Harris, seeking to tie her performance to Biden's perceived mental and physical decline.\n\nDespite the tumult that led to Biden's withdrawal from the race, advocates for Harris see an opportunity to ensure she gets credit for the many legislative accomplishments the two were able to achieve during their tenure.\n\n\"The call itself felt like winning -- to be engaged, to be in community, to speak (and yell!) about what's possible is where real change and progress begins -- and to be in that moment with over 44,000 women, sisters, friends, strangers -- it was truly priceless!\" Margaret Anadu, an attendee who is also an impact investor, told theGrio.\n\n\"I have laughed and cried and prayed on this call. It has truly been an experience,\" said an anonymous attendee who is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., the same Black Greek-letter organization as Harris.\n\n\"[Dr.] Johnnetta Cole [said] 'Don't ever let them say Black women can't do it,'\" she added.\n\n\"I was one of the 44,000,\" read the text of a social media graphic of Harris speaking that Win With Black Women created. The post started to spread like wildfire Monday morning, as attendees reflected on what the meeting meant to them.\n\nIf Win With Black Women's remarkable Zoom call was any indication of how efficiently Black women can organize politically, the 2024 race for president could be historic in more ways than one.\n\n\"I am FED and LIFTED.

And that energy was especially apparent among Black and South Asian voters, who see themselves represented in Harris' historic candidacy. Leaders in Pennsylvania's Black and Asian American communities speculated Monday that excitement would grow, enabling Democrats to recruit new or disengaged voters.\n\n\"If we do the work, and we will, if we inspire, if we mobilize, if we organize we could see historic turnout in November,\" said Montgomery County Commissioner Neil Makhija, the first Asian American to serve as a county commissioner in the state and the former leader of an Indian American voter engagement group.\n\nMore than half a million Asian Americans live in Pennsylvania, making up 3% of the state's voting population, while 12.7% of the state's population in Black. In a critical swing state where the election is expected to be very close, those voters will be pivotal in November. Harris' candidacy could be especially impactful in heavily Democratic Philadelphia, where more than 39% of the population is Black and 8% of the population is Asian.\n\nAnton Moore, a community organizer and the leader of Philadelphia's 48th Ward, said Black voters in his South Philly neighborhood are ready to stand behind Harris.\n\n\"When you look at the Democratic Party, who is it? It's Black women,\" he said.\n\nState Sen. Nikil Saval (D., Philadelphia), who is the first Indian American to serve in the Pennsylvania Senate, said that while Harris had a story that would resonate with many voters of color driving engagement off of that isn't always simple.\n\n\"It can't just be invoked,\" he said. \"To speak to people and to reach people, it has to be substantive.\"\n\nRecent polling of Asian American voters showed Biden had lost support among the group but maintained a strong lead over former President Trump. While the poll, conducted by AAPIData in April and May, didn't track Harris' chances against Trump, it showed her overall favorability among Asian Americans was slightly lower than Biden's.\n\nAnd polls have shown that Trump has more support with Black voters this year, particularly with Black men nationally, than he did in 2020. Biden has still led with that demographic in recent polls, but not as decisively as he did four years ago. It's not yet clear how Democrats' switch to Harris would affect polling among Black voters in Pennsylvania.\n\nDeanda Wilson, a Black Mount Airy voter and former federal government employee who has volunteered in local elections and serves as an inspector of elections, was disappointed with what she called a superficial look at Biden's performance. Still, she's looking forward to supporting Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"She would be an excellent president and as soon as I get a chance to breathe I am going to be out there knocking on doors... to get her elected,\" she said.\n\nPhiladelphia City Councilmember Cindy Bass, who is Black, said Harris is highly qualified, and she is confident the vice president can win in November.\n\nStill, Bass said she worries Harris will face additional scrutiny due to her identity.\n\n\"There's always some sort of unknown, unspoken, unidentifiable trait that people want to attach to Black women in politics,\" said Bass, who leads Philadelphia's 8th District.\n\nAhmad points to Harris's career track record to dispel that idea. Her political career began two decades ago when she was elected district attorney of San Francisco, and she has also served as California's attorney general and as a senator.\n\n\"She has done her due diligence of starting locally and building herself up, so she is supremely qualified,\" said Ahmad.\n\nFor some AAPI communities, language barriers and access to accurate information also pose a sharp and specific challenge in informing voters that the Democratic ticket has changed said Wei Chen, a Philadelphia community activist who specializes in voter engagement.\n\n\"That's going to be very hard, to re-educate people like, 'Hey, the presidential candidate is not Biden anymore,'\" said Chen, who works with residents who have limited English proficiency.\n\nMohan Sheshadri, who heads the Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance and works to help voters with language barriers, said that Harris -- and any candidate -- should look at \"the full diversity of our communities\" and noted that Pennsylvania's Asian communities aren't monolithic and speak 22 different languages.\n\n\"Organizationally, a meteor just hit,\" Sheshadri said of Harris's rise. \"The ground just shifted under our feet.\"\n\nThe potential for Harris' nomination also left many Democrats with a sense that it's time for a woman of color to become president. And that Harris had earned her spot.\n\nSaid Salima Suswell, founder of the Black Muslim Leadership Council, \"It's time for a woman to run this country. It's time for a Black woman to be taken seriously as a leader in this nation.\"\n\nJamila Winder, a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and the first Black woman to serve as a Montgomery County commissioner, touted Harris' qualifications.\n\n\"If she gets the nomination,\" Winder said, \"it's because of all her education, her experience, her professional experience, her public service experience. She just happens to be a Black woman.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "layla_a_jones@inquirer.com", "name": "Layla A.

Clyburn of South Carolina, \"ridin' with Biden\" no matter what.\n\nThat powerful defense, though, has not been driven solely by a yearning for a second term of the Biden presidency, according to interviews with dozens of them over the past week. It is also born of a palpable fear among many Black and Hispanic Democrats that in their rush to ditch Mr. Biden, some in the party will also seek to skip over Ms. Harris, throwing open the nominating process in a way that would defy the will of their communities.\n\n\"I'm in these rooms; I see what they say in conversations,\" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, said during a social media stream on Thursday night. \"A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president. They are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\nOne of the factors prolonging what has been an agonizing period of reckoning among Democrats about Mr. Biden's fate is a racial divide on the future of their party, and who should have the greatest say in what it looks like.\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Biden's support among Black lawmakers and voters is not just rooted in concern about Ms. Harris's future; they have long been the core of his base. Veteran Black and Hispanic lawmakers have celebrated Mr. Biden's domestic agenda as delivering for their constituents.\n\nBut underlying the sense of urgency among Black lawmakers to defend the president is a feeling many of them share that those pushing the hardest for Mr. Biden to go are predominantly white lawmakers and an elite class of donors who do not necessarily back Ms. Harris and are not prioritizing the wishes of Black voters who consistently turn out for the party.\n\n\"To not choose her is a slap in the face to Black women,\" said Melanie Campbell, chairwoman of the Power of the Ballot Action Fund, an advocacy organization focused on Black voter engagement. \"You are saying to Black women that what we represent is not good enough -- not only to stay with the man we voted for, but the woman that most of us advocated for, to be the vice president. You take her down, then you lose the Black women's vote.\"\n\nWith Mr. Biden's future mired in uncertainty, the White House has continued to rely on Ms. Harris while the president self-isolated in Delaware with a case of Covid. She made an unscheduled appearance Friday afternoon at a newly opened ice cream shop in Washington owned by the supermodel Tyra Banks, with her grandnieces in tow. Later, Ms. Harris held a call with major party donors at the request of Mr. Biden's senior advisers, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.\n\nAs Mr. Biden has pushed back defiantly on the calls for him to leave the race, he has leaned heavily on the support of Black and Hispanic lawmakers, effectively using their backing as a shield against calls for him to step down. His first meeting with lawmakers after the June 27 debate was a video meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus that turned into something of a pep rally, according to attendees.\n\nThis week, the White House invited members of C.B.C. and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to travel with Mr. Biden on Air Force One to Las Vegas, and as the list of lawmakers calling for the president to step aside has grown longer, many Black and Hispanic leaders have fanned out across the country to defend his candidacy and legislative record.\n\nThe clear implication has been that calling on Mr. Biden to withdraw is counter to the wishes of a loyal and crucial part of the party base. But that tactic has not succeeded in tamping down on dissent.\n\nNow, with Democratic leaders and prominent lawmakers becoming more and more vocal about their view that Mr. Biden must exit the race, Black and Hispanic leaders have become more direct about their insistence that Ms. Harris is the only alternative.\n\nDuring a dinner of Congressional Black Caucus members this week in Las Vegas, Mr. Clyburn, who helped resurrect Mr. Biden's 2020 campaign, defended the Biden-Harris ticket and said choosing instead to hold an open contest for the nomination would not be good for the party, according to people present at the dinner.\n\n\"If anything does change from President Biden, the only option for us Democrats is to support Kamala Harris, period -- point blank, period,\" said Quentin James, co-founder of the Collective PAC, which aims to help Black candidates seek elected positions and promotes voter outreach in minority communities.\n\nAimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization that supports women of color in politics, said she and other leaders of Democratic organizations have started conversations with delegates going to the Democratic National Convention next month to ensure that they would support Ms. Harris as the nominee should Mr. Biden step aside.\n\nProminent Democrats like Representative Adam B. Schiff of California and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms. Allison said, \"should be as fervent, as clear, as strategic about unifying support behind the vice president with three and a half months out.\"\n\n\"Otherwise, they're deeply, deeply out of touch about how Democrats have won elections,\" she said. \"The calls for Biden to withdraw feel empty without a call for unity.\"\n\nSome of the members of Congress who have called on Mr. Biden to drop out -- an overwhelmingly white group -- have said explicitly that there should be an open primary to replace him.\n\n\"It's important to have a fair, open and democratic primary,\" said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, the first Democrat in Congress to urge the president to step aside. He stressed that Ms. Harris would be in a strong position but suggested it would be helpful for the party to demonstrate that \"this is not the product of a smoke-filled room or a handful of power brokers, but that there's genuine democracy here.\"\n\nMany Black and Hispanic Democrats are adamantly opposed to that. A group of leading Black Democrats circulated a letter on Friday pushing back on the calls for Mr. Biden to bow out, but also making it clear that Mr. Harris must step in if he did.\n\n\"If -- and we stress if -- President Biden chooses not to run for a second term, we are clear that our choice is Vice President Harris,\" the letter said. \"We don't have to go and find a savior or great hope elsewhere,\" said the group, which includes a number of Black leaders in the Democratic Party. \"We already have it in our vice president.\"\n\nA separate public letter of support organized by Black women with more than 2,600 signatures as of Friday condemned the infighting in the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to support the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nBlack and Hispanic members of Congress are not a monolith; a few younger lawmakers of color have called for Mr. Biden to exit the race and some privately believe Ms. Harris should not automatically be elevated should he do so. Republicans have also made inroads with Mr. Biden's support among Black and Latino voters, according to polling.\n\nPart of Mr. Biden's motivation to remain on the ticket is a long-held concern that he has a better chance of beating Mr. Trump than Ms. Harris. In public, however, Mr. Biden has increasingly turned to Ms. Harris to energize Black voters.\n\nOn Tuesday at the N.A.A.C.P. National Convention in Las Vegas, the president drew his most enthusiastic response a crowd of roughly 4,000 when he attacked Mr. Trump for his comment about \"Black jobs\" at the presidential debate -- and cited Ms. Harris.\n\n\"I know what a Black job is,\" Mr. Biden said to roaring applause. \"It's the vice president of the United States.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news",

Well, it's our time to do it for her,\" said Michael Blake, an organizer of the \"Black Men for Harris\" fundraiser.\n\nThousands of Black men raised more than $1.3 million during a Monday evening virtual fundraiser call in support of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to Quentin James of The Collective PAC, one of the organizers for the \"Black Men for Harris\" call, more than 45,000 Black men convened online to rally around Harris' candidacy, just one day after President Joe Biden suspended his reelection campaign and endorsed his vice president for the party's nomination.\n\nJames, along with political and legal strategist Bakari Sellers, Khalil Thompson of Win With Black Men, and Michael Blake of Kairos Democracy Project, organized Monday's call, which was hosted and streamed by Roland Martin's Black Star Network. The goal of the call was to match funds raised during a similar call hosted Sunday night by Win With Black Women.\n\nWhile the collective of Black men did not reach the fundraising target of $1.5 million for the Harris for President campaign, the organizers noted they were able to raise the $1.3 million from more than 17,000 donors in less time.\n\nBlake of Kairos Democracy Project told theGrio that Monday's call was \"an incredible collaboration\" that brought together Black male organizers, elected officials, and staff working for the White House and Harris campaign.\n\n\"Last night, we made it very clear that Black men count and Black men must be counted. Black men must be at the table, and we do not accept that we are not in the game,\" Blake told theGrio. \"We made it very clear that for a long time, sisters have held us down. Well, it's our time to do it for her.\"\n\nAfter 48 hours of fundraising for Harris among Black women and Black men, resulting in a total of $2.8 million, Blake noted, \"It's pretty clear what's possible\" when Black communities unite.\n\n\"They will try to attack her, they will try to attack us. But if we remind people that we always have strength in numbers and strength in message, we win,\" added Blake.\n\nBlack male leaders who joined Monday night's call to deliver brief remarks included Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.), America's first Gen Z member of Congress.\n\nNotably, Frost works with Harris in the White House Office of Gun Violence and Prevention, which Biden established last year.\n\n\"The vice president has been a leader in that office, fighting to ensure we have hundreds of millions of dollars going to our communities across the entire country. And so that's one of the many reasons I'm proud to be supporting her,\" said Frost.\n\nThe nation's youngest congressman noted that gun violence is a critically important issue to young voters, particularly young Black men who are \"surviving gun violence on a daily basis.\"\n\nFrost expressed optimism that Harris could \"bring this issue to the forefront and talk about it in the way that needs to be spoken about.\"\n\nTennessee State Rep. Justin Jones also joined the virtual call, noting that he and others in the state \"stand with the vice president because she stood with us in one of our darkest times.\"\n\nJones, along with State Rep. Justin J. Pearson, was expelled by the state legislature last year after joining anti-gun-violence demonstrators inside the state capitol building. The next day, Harris made a surprise visit to Nashville to condemn the expulsions as an affront to democracy and racial justice.\n\nFlorida State Sen. Shevrin Jones, who was on Monday's call, told theGrio that the fundraising effort showed \"solidarity and strength.\"\n\nRecommended Stories\n\n\"While the call was for Black men, it was inspiring to see our allies join in this historic moment,\" said Jones, an adviser for the Harris campaign. \"This momentum is just the beginning of what's to come; the Black community comprehends the consequences of a potential second Trump presidency, and we stand steadfast against it.\"\n\nMontgomery Mayor Steven Reed, who delivered remarks during the \"Black Men for Harris\" call, told theGrio the collective fundraising effort reflected the historical nature of how \"Black communities can organize in a way that we have always organized with very little to no resources.\"\n\n\"It shows the collective power and the proximity that we have to one another to organize around causes that we feel are significant for our progress,\" said Reed, who serves as president of the African American Mayors Association.\n\nHe continued, \"Whether it was our ancestors who organized the Underground Railroad, often talking through songs like 'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,' or whether it was the Montgomery bus boycott ... all the way through President Obama's run when so many of us were just really getting ingrained in social media.\"\n\nReed predicted that the online fundraiser is a \"great indicator for what is to come.\"\n\n\"It has just awakened the sleeping giant,\" he added. \"That organizing capability, I think, will be shown across the country and certainly in the swing states where this race is expected to come down to just a few thousand votes.\"", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gerren_keith_gaynor@thegrio.com", "name": "Gerren Keith Gaynor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Blake_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Blake (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGrio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TheGrio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalil_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khalil Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakari_Sellers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bakari Sellers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxwell Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Horsford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Horsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_J._Pearson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin J.

I just want you to vote.", "body": "I'm not impressed by the fawning over Kamala Harris and the high-fives from feminists.\n\nQuestlove and Sheryl Lee Ralph's endorsements are nice, but I could care less about them.\n\nWhat matters is that the people -- all people -- vote. Anyone who is afraid for America's future must vote. Every person who believes women have agency over their reproductive systems can't not vote. (Shoot, any person who thinks women deserve their C-Suite jobs need vote.) Every person who knows LGBTQIA+ people deserve equal rights needs to hot foot it to the polls.\n\nIf you believe all Americans are created equal -- Vote. Vote. Vote.\n\n\" READ MORE: The glowing eyes on Market Street represent the hidden history of Thomas Jefferson's enslaved valet, Robert Hemmings\n\nIt's great that Harris has the potential to connect with younger people, but it doesn't mean squat if those meme creators and re-posters don't vote. So, if Harris wins the Democratic nomination for president, we have to vote for her and it's not because she's a woman, or a Black woman. Her candidacy is not a victory for the pantsuit nation and the pussy hat parade -- it's our last chance to save democracy.\n\nPop culture is full of dramatic, political utopian fantasies like Veep, Scandal, and House of Cards, where women ascend to the presidency and ultimately all is right with the world. We know what chaos looks like, and we take for granted that it will all work out in the end.\n\nIn the writers' room democracy always wins. But this is real life.\n\nCharlottesville was a dress rehearsal. Jan. 6 was real. Project 2025, that calls for the firing of thousands of civil servants who could be replaced by political appointees who demonstrate loyalty to Trump, is in the pipeline.\n\nIf we allow Trump and his VP pick JD Vance to win, we don't deserve the America we say means so much to us. The one our ancestors died to keep and protect. The one my grandfather -- a Black man -- fought valiantly for in World War II and faced discrimination in when he came home from Europe, forcing my grandmother -- a Black woman -- to hold our family down.\n\nThis election is about so much more than Kamala Harris being the first Black woman candidate. And yet, it's ironic that once again Black women bear the brunt of holding America accountable to its ideals of equality. When Black women were enslaved, their children were ripped from their wombs and our hearts. America's elite -- that includes Democrats -- ridiculed us, acting as if we were all \"Hottentot Venuses\" and \"Welfare Queens.\" Still, because Black women have an inherent understanding that when any American is denied their human rights all of us are at risk, we must rise to the occasion. We don't have a choice.\n\nIda B. Wells and Mary McCleod Bethune risked their lives in the 19th century with their abolitionist and civil rights work. Shirley Chisolm defied the odds and became the first woman to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination back in 1971. Under the tutelage of Stacey Abrams, Black women organized Georgia, delivering Biden a 2020 presidential victory and ensuring Raphael Warnock was elected as a Georgia senator in a highly-contested 2022 run-off, helping Democrats take control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nIn recent history, pop-culture has been more than willing to pay lip service to the fabulousness of Black women, demanding that America listen to them. In this election, the key difference is that instead of working to advance someone else, it is a Black woman who will potentially be the front runner to lead the country. This requires political action, support, and trust. All of our lives depend on it.\n\nI've trusted in Black women since the day I was born -- my mother, grandmother, aunties, friends, and fellow newspaper women -- and they have never led me astray.\n\nHarris is electable, if you elect her.\n\nWe are off to a good start. Harris' campaign raised more than $100 million between Sunday afternoon and Monday evening, as reported reported to CBS early Tuesday. Democrats are finally coalescing. As of Tuesday morning, Harris secured over 2,600 delegates, well over the threshold of 1,976 delegates needed to win the nomination. (That includes Pennsylvania's 159 delegates, who voted unanimously to support her.)\n\nShe kicked off her campaign Monday morning with two high profile appearances. First, she spoke at a White House event lauding NCAA champions, and praising Biden for his exemplary term as president. (That's the kind of loyalty Democrats need, isn't it?) At Harris' Wilmington headquarters Monday evening, she drew cheers talking about her work as a California attorney general and prosecutor who took on perpetrators who \"abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.\"\n\n\"So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type,\" she said to a thunderous crowd.\n\nSo what if you don't like Harris' laugh? Get over the fact that Harris reminds you of the pretty, popular girl in high school who ignored you. That says more about your self-esteem than it does about her potential presidency.\n\nI'm excited Harris is Howard University alum. I'm thrilled she's a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the country's oldest Black sorority whose legacy of powerful Black women always rise to the challenge of saving America. I'm excited that 44,000 Black women met virtually Sunday to strategize Harris' win and raise money. One thing Black women know is the deal. We will vote for Harris. America needs to follow suit.\n\nI'm not interested in a celebration. I don't want a pat on the head. I want everyone who cares to vote.

Only this time, the call swelled to include more than 44,000 people - forcing Zoom to lift capacity limitations - with an additional 30,000 joining in on a Clubhouse stream, and an unknown number of others connecting to unauthorized livestreams, organizers said. Even as late as 1am, people continued trying to join the call.\n\n\"We were so elated and pleased to see [Biden] fully endorse Vice-President Kamala Harris, and so we all got on that Zoom, united around our joy, united around our desire to be together in history,\" Jotaka Eaddy, Win With Black Women's founder, said. \"But [we] also united around our support of Vice-President Harris and our commitment to do the work to make sure that she's the next president of the United States and that we beat Donald Trump and the Maga agenda.\n\nThe group first convened four years ago \"around our collective outrage to the racism, the sexism that was taking place in the presidential process\".\n\nRelated: 'I'm extremely excited': Kamala Harris inspires Milwaukee rally-goers\n\nWhile Sunday's number of call attendees was unexpected, Win With Black Women was able to accommodate and mobilize them because of the extensive framework the organization has built.\n\n\"It is important to recognize Jotaka Eaddy, Holli Holliday, Chrisina Cue, Chantel Mullen, Edwina Ward, Hollye Weekes,\" Sesha Joi Moon, who was present on the call, said. \"These are the women that were responsible for 71,000 registrants, 44,000 and counting logging on ... then helped to raise $1.5m in three hours [for] the first potential Black woman president in the United States of America.\"\n\nMoon was formerly the chief diversity officer for the US House of Representatives for the 117th and 118th Congress. After her position was eliminated a few months ago, she recalls saying that it was \"a very sad day for America\". Sunday night gave her a renewed sense of hope.\n\n\"Regardless of your race, your gender, your religion, your sexual orientation, your immigrant status, your military service status, your geographic location, your educational level, your ability status as it relates to being disabled - we said we want a country where everyone belongs,\" she said.\n\nSunday's Win With Black Women call featured prominent Black women including representatives Maxine Waters, Joyce Beatty and Jasmine Crockett; Danette Antony Reed, president of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority; actor Jenifer Lewis; and LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. The Zoom call included an intergenerational representation of Black women and girls along with Latino, AAPI and male allies.\n\n\"It was one of the best feelings ever,\" Sophia Casey, who joined the Zoom call from Washington DC, said. \"The sisterhood, I was just sharing with another colleague who didn't get to make the call, that the sisterhood was just delicious.\"\n\nTiffany Crutcher received an invitation to join from Debra Watts, with whom Crutcher has done social justice organizing, then used her own networks to invite hundreds of additional women, she said.\n\n\"We've carried this Democratic party for decades - we're the margin of victory. This is our time, and that's the energy I felt on that call,\" Crutcher said. \"All of the energy and the organizing that we're doing on the ground ... We're gonna use that energy all the way into November.\"\n\nEaddy said that \"there is a fire in the country right now of excitement\". The Monday-night call had more than 5,000 women who were interested in joining, and following the Win With Black Women call, a coalition of several groups organized a another under the banner of Win With Black Men.\n\nIn 2016 and 2020, 94% and 90% of Black women, respectively, supported the Democratic nominee. If Harris is successful in clinching her party's nomination, for the first time, Black female voters will have the opportunity to vote for a Black woman representing a major political party for president.\n\n\"To see the breadth of Black women in joy, but also committed to the work that is ahead of us, it's a feeling that I will never, ever lose,\" Eaddy said. \"I will take it with me for the rest of my life.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki",

Polls had shown Black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Biden during the 2020 election, had been moving away from the Democratic party following concerns about inflation, slow progress on civil-rights issues and the president's support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Trump, meanwhile, had sought to make gains with Black voters.\n\nOthers on the call included former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, Washington, DC mayor Muriel Bowser and Maryland's First Lady Dawn Moore. Maryland governor Wes Moore later issued a statement supporting Harris' candidacy. The huge attendance for the call meant that organizers had to ask Zoom Video Communications Inc. to extend the capacity limit for the meeting, which the video conferencing company was able to do for the customer.\n\nRepresentative Beatty, a Democrat representing Ohio in Congress, urged attendees to use their platforms to rally support for Harris in their communities. \"We come with a strong message because we're in the fight, we're on this journey, we realize the magnitude of this moment,\" she said.\n\nWin With Black Women organizers didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sign up to stay connected.\n\n\"Black Vote, Black Power,\" a collaboration between Keith Boykin and Word In Black,\n\nexamines the issues, the candidates, and what's at stake for Black America in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when decades happen.\"\n\nThat's what it felt like this week when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race for re-election and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic Party's new nominee.\n\nNow the party must unite behind Kamala Harris, allow her to pick a new running mate, and move on to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nRELATED: With a Trump Win, Republican Judges Will Rule the Courts -- and Our Lives\n\nAfter weeks of Democratic in-fighting, Biden's historic withdrawal shifts the momentum away from the Republican Party and back toward the Democrats heading into their convention in Chicago next month.\n\nThe great stunt queen, Donald Trump, thought he won the publicity wars last week when he dramatically announced his new running mate, the inexperienced freshman Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, and told the world the story of surviving an assassination attempt in his rambling 90-minute convention speech.\n\nNow that's old news, and we have a fundamentally different race. Instead of a contest between two unpopular, old white guys, the new race pits a 59-year-old Black woman against a 78-year-old convicted felon.\n\nRELATED: How Will Project 2025 Affect Black America?\n\nIt's the past versus the future. An all-white-male Republican ticket or a Democratic ticket led by an accomplished Black woman. A party that carries the heavy baggage of scandals, impeachments, indictments, and 34 felony convictions from Donald Trump or a party that has an opportunity to reinvent itself with Kamala Harris.\n\nI've said all along that I will support the Democratic nominee for president, but I've publicly worried about the donor class and wondered if they would accept Harris as the new nominee.\n\nSome floated ideas of an open primary or a \"blitz primary\" with candidate forums moderated by Republicans like Condoleezza Rice. And TV producer Aaron Sorkin even suggested the ridiculous idea that Democrats should nominate Republican Mitt Romney for president.\n\nNo, no, and no.\n\nAll those Democratic donors and party insiders who spent the past few weeks pushing Biden out of the race better pony up their money, time, and energy and start contributing to Kamala Harris's campaign and the Democratic Party. This is the new Plan B.\n\nWe've heard a lot of Democratic names floated for president in the past few weeks: Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, Pete Buttigieg, Wes Moore, Andy Beshear, and Mark Kelly. But now that President Biden has endorsed Vice President Harris, I hope and expect those leaders will stand down and support her, if for no other reason than loyalty to President Biden.\n\nBut also because there are financial obstacles if Democrats nominate someone other than Harris. Harris was Biden's running mate, so she can tap into the $96 million Biden has in the bank. Any new candidate may have to start from scratch. Let's not make this any more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nNow is the time for the Democratic Party to step up. You say you are an inclusive party of women and people of color. It's time to prove it and get behind Kamala Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus quickly announced its support for Harris.\n\nKeith Boykin is a New York Times-bestselling author, TV and film producer, and former CNN political commentator.

Roland Martin broadcasted the call across various social media channels through his Black Star Network.\n\nThe call happened one day after Win With Black Women raised over $1.5 million in three hours. On the call, former South Carolina state representative and current political commentator Bakari Sellers gave an emotional testimony about a time when Harris helped him. He said she was there for him during a period when his wife's life had to be saved after she gave birth to their twins in 2019.

She's ready.\"\n\n\"For Black women, we're saying, 'it's about time,'\" she added. \"We're celebrating this moment in history.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/kiro_cox_articles_720/9ad18c59d67ffba00d70784017da42a9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 860, "textEnd": 867}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

I've largely dismissed this as frustrated rhetoric but I'm now seeing this echoed elsewhere.\n\nMSNBC's Ja'han Jones attributes a similar view to AOC and others.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has issued a dire warning to her party about the chaos that could ensue if they succeed in pushing President Joe Biden off the ticket. And she criticized Democrats who've given off-the-record quotes that suggest the party has resigned itself to a second Trump term.\n\nIn an Instagram Live video on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez warned liberals that a brokered convention could lead to chaos, in part because she says some of the Democratic \"elites\" who want Biden out also don't want Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee in his place.\n\n[...]\n\nOcasio-Cortez also highlighted the racial, ethnic and class divisions that appear to have formed between the majority of those pining to blow up the ticket -- led mostly by white Democrats and media pundits -- and those elected officials who feel they and their constituents have too much at stake to upend the process at this point and so are willing to do the work to re-elect Biden-Harris. She alluded to this cultural divide in her video when she spoke out against anonymous sources expressing a sense of fatalism on behalf of Democrats about what might happen if Biden remains on the ticket\n\nI searched in vain for a transcription or at least a more detailed reporting of this version of AOC's remarks and am not interested in spending an hour watching the Instagram post. So, it's possible Jones is interpreting her comments through his own lens.\n\nRegardless, Jones notes,\n\nEarlier this week, I noted similar criticism voiced in a letter from the voter advocacy group Black Voters Matter that denounced some Democrats' haphazard effort to overrule primary voters, oust Biden and potentially leapfrog Harris as the obvious second-in-line to be the party's nominee. Part of that criticism stemmed from the fact that mobilizing Biden-Harris voters to cast a ballot for an entirely new set of nominees would most likely prove difficult.\n\nAnd the criticism didn't end there. In fact, hours before Ocasio-Cortez's post to Instagram on Thursday, more than 1,400 Black women who are activists signed a separate letter calling out Democrats who are seeking to push Biden out and install someone other than Harris atop the ticket.\n\nDemocrats ought to heed these warnings and cease their hasty effort to oust Biden (or, failing that, to push aside Harris in the process) at the risk of fomenting resentment among voting blocs that are essential to their electoral goals.\n\nThat's all pretty anecdotal. But the little data I can find seems to back it up.\n\nA recent poll commissioned by Split Ticket (\"We Polled Black Voters. Here's What We Found.\"), a group about which I have no knowledge, presents a lot of interesting data and analysis about Black attitudes toward the election. Regarding the specific question of replacing Biden on the ticket, we get this:\n\nAlthough Black voters are ready to back President Biden by large margins if he chooses to stay in the race, it is clear that they are far more split on whether he should. While a clear majority of respondents reject the claim that he is too old to be president, Black voters are noticeably more divided on the question of whether he should step aside.\n\nOur survey finds that 49% of Black voters think that Biden should remain in the race, compared with 43% who believe he should drop out. Notably, there is a clear divide observed among partisan lines; 60% of Black Democrats believe he should stay in, while this figure is just 33% with Independents and 12% with Republicans.\n\nOne of the other big dividing lines observed is among age -- 62% of Black voters under 30 and 58% of Black voters between the ages of 30 and 44 believe that Biden should step aside. Older respondents, meanwhile, are more opposed to Biden leaving the race, with 68% of Black respondents over 65 favoring Biden staying in. This lines up with the primary elections, where older Black voters were consistently Biden's strongest group, carrying him to commanding victories in states like South Carolina.\n\nWe also asked respondents whether Biden should take time to reconsider running in the presidential election. A majority (52%) agree that Biden should take time to reconsider, compared with 42% who disagree. While a commanding number of Black Independent and Republican respondents agree that Biden should reconsider running, Black Democrats are more divided -- they split 49-46 on whether the president should reconsider his bid.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that if Biden does withdraw from the election, our survey suggests that Black voters are considerably more likely than not to view his decision as strengthening his legacy rather than weakening it, by a margin of 48-34.\n\nAlas, a survey of only Blacks voters doesn't tell us much about how they compare to White voters. But the recent AP-NORC poll shows a pretty substantial divide:\n\nWhite and Hispanic Democrats want Biden to withdraw by a 2:1 margin whereas Black Democrats are 50-50.\n\nSimilarly, an Economist/YouGov poll similarly shows significantly more enthusiasm for Biden's withdrawals among White and Hispanics than Blacks:\n\nI'm not sure what to make of all of this, to be honest. Black support was critical to Biden's securing the nomination in 2020 and they're roughly a quarter of the Democratic base. Clearly, they're either more satisfied with Biden's performance in office, more comfortable with his declining verbal acuity, or more confident of his ability to defeat Trump (or some combination of those) than than their White co-partisans.\n\nBut this quotation from AOC's Instagram commentary is noteworthy:\n\nWhat I will say is what upsets me is [Democrats] saying we will lose. For me, to a certain extent, I don't care what name is on there. We are not losing. I don't know about you, but my community does not have the option to lose. My community does not have the luxury of accepting loss in July of an election year. My people are the first ones deported. They're the first ones put in Rikers. They're the first ones whose families are killed by war.\n\nHyperbole aside, it's not unreasonable for Blacks and other marginalized groups to see the stakes of the election as higher. Although, interestingly, the polling shows that Hispanics -- who would seemingly have even more reason to fear a Trump presidency -- have essentially the same views on the matter as Whites.", "source": {"uri": "outsidethebeltway.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outside the Beltway"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_joyner@outsidethebeltway.com", "name": "James Joyner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokered_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brokered convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_bloc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voting bloc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://otb.cachefly.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Biden-Reporters-Microphone-Happy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

With the largest population of Black voters in the state, national attention has focused on cities like Milwaukee.\n\nDuring the RNC a panel discussion hosted by the Black Republican Mayors Association featured prominent speakers, including Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican in the U.S. Senate.\n\nMore: They are Republicans in a Democratic city. Meet these conservative Milwaukeeans\n\n\"As African-American conservatives, sometimes it's easy to feel like you're the only one. ... You are not the only one,\" Scott said on the second day of the RNC.\n\nThe party sought to include voices that haven't traditionally been expected to vote Republican, including a speaking slot for model and rapper Amber Rose, who called herself a convert to former President Donald Trump, who was nominated as the Republican candidate for the officer during the RNC in Milwaukee.\n\nYet, despite some Black Republicans' appearances, only 3% of delegates were Black at the 2024 RNC of delegates who reported their ethnicity.\n\n\"I realized Donald Trump and his supporters don't care if you're Black, white, gay or straight. It's all love,\" Rose said the first night of the convention.\n\nThe RNC's message didn't resonate with these Black Milwaukee voters\n\nVoters who spoke with the Journal Sentinel said the RNC's pitch didn't sway their politics.\n\nDJ Denson, owner of Coffee Makes You Black, said his business hadn't been affected, positively or negatively, by the RNC.\n\nDespite being two miles away from a convention that drew approximately 50,000 people, life went on as normal in the coffeehouse.\n\n\"I'll just say that I haven't seen a strong Republican presence in my neighborhood or my business, so it sounds good, but the only thing I heard is we got 'Black jobs,'\" Denson said, referring to former president Donald Trump's comment during last month's debate that drew criticism.\n\n\"That kind of rhetoric has always been dangerous with the Republican Party but a lot of things kind of go unchecked -- interesting comment, but not surprised,\" Denson said.\n\nTony Courtney, a patron in Coffee Makes you Black, predicted the Republican Party would probably pick up \"some votes\" from their RNC message -- he called the convention's appeal to Black voters a \"great show\" -- but said the Democrats would likely pick up support, too after the party's own convention next month in Chicago.\n\nInstead of the political appeals, patrons said they would rather see emphasis on policies that would help their community, including education, homelessness and incarceration -- especially with Trump being found guilty of felony crimes.\n\n\"We have people that literally have issues in life ... probably don't get a second chance because they're a felon,\" Michelle Trigg said Wednesday morning. \"I don't know if he can have the second chance -- he's human just like the rest of us -- but why can't they have a second chance?\"\n\nTammi Lee, speaking from Sherman Phoenix marketplace, said Republicans efforts fell flat, as it seemed like they were just trying to pander for votes. She wanted to see more of an emphasis on federal funding helping Milwaukee's Black community.\n\n\"With all the wars and things going on, a lot of the funds are going to different countries when we can really utilize those funds within our own communities,\" Lee said.\n\nSeveral criticized Rose's appearance at the convention, and argued there would have to be more than influencers to sway them.\n\n\"Tell them to try harder,\" Trigg said. \"That ain't it, girl.\"\n\nVoters had mixed feelings about Democratic Party\n\nWhile they didn't feel swayed by the Republican Party's message, voters weren't all that enthusiastic about the Democrats either.\n\nThurman said that while there were some exceptions for people running for Milwaukee Common Council, she hasn't seen people coming to Milwaukee's Black community to ask about the issues, Democrats included.\n\nCourtney said both parties have made promises -- \"it's what politics is all about.\"\n\nHe added that if politicians are doing their jobs and keeping their promises, \"that should be enough to keep them in office.\"\n\nTrigg said the swaying Black voters was not a party issue if they don't focus on the communities themselves.\n\n\"Who's gonna be for us?\" Trigg asked. \"Who is going to be the voice for us, because they're the voice for themselves.

We are going to support her, we're going to raise money for her, and we're going to get out the vote for her.\"\n\nThe call shows the ways in which Black women, a key Democratic voting bloc, plan to galvanize and organize to support Harris. The call, which attracted several celebrities and political figures, was off the record and everyone spoke in their personal capacities, but many attendees described to The Post that it felt like church, a family reunion, a rally or the online hangouts from the height of quarantine.\n\nEven though they were told not to, people streamed the Zoom on other sites such as Clubhouse, Twitch and YouTube.\n\nEaddy organized the Zoom call the same way in which she hosted most Sunday night calls for Win With Black Women since August 2020. The organization says it aims to elect Black women nationwide and speaks out against racism and sexism. At the height of the 2020 election, she said the most attendees she had on one Zoom call was 1,500 people. Eaddy was expecting a few hundred last night.\n\nBut she realized something was different around 2 p.m., when she got a message that 50 people were in the Zoom waiting room. The call was set to start at 8:30 p.m.\n\nBy 7:50 p.m., the Zoom was at capacity with 1,000 people. Members contacted Zoom, which moved the group to a webinar, giving them unlimited capacity to expand their attendees.\n\n\"I am forever grateful to the leadership of Zoom for what they did,\" Eaddy said.\n\nShe said \"allies\" who identify as Latinx, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Black men joined the Zoom to show their support. But the majority of the call focused on Black women's collective power to elect Harris.\n\n\"What happened last night was historic,\" Eaddy said. \"It really is the culmination of so many Black women for years and years and years that have been working, cultivating and creating for this moment. And last night was also a homage, a work to them and their sacrifice.\"\n\nBernice King, the youngest child of Martin Luther King, Jr., 85-year-old Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the most senior Black woman in the House, and Donna Brazile, the two-time acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, each spoke during the call. Jones, actress Jenifer Lewis, first lady of Maryland Dawn Moore, radio host Angela Rye, U.S. Senate hopeful Angela D. Alsobrooks and author Luvvie Ajayi Jones also joined.\n\nMany representatives of the nine Black sororities and fraternities that exist under the National Pan-Hellenic Council, known as the Divine Nine, also spoke. Alpha Kappa Alpha, of which Harris is a member, formed the first Black sorority in 1908.\n\nNaima Cochrane, a music industry executive and writer, spent the early part of her Sunday afternoon shocked about Biden's announcement. She said she was not confident in American voters though she was confident about Harris. But the call lit a fire under her.\n\n\"There was no conversation about doubt. There was no 'what if we can't,' it was 'this is what we're about to do,\" Cochrane said. \"People needed to know directives. That there is a strategy, that we're unified in messaging, and their next steps. We can go forward confidently and strongly now to combat misinformation and combat naysayers.\"\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, who has endorsed Harris, said she got at least 10 messages from people telling her about the Zoom call. Bowser told The Post on Monday that she was at an event celebrating Washington's restaurant scene when she joined the call. When other women heard she was stepping out to log on, they asked if they could come. So a dozen women huddled around an iPhone outside the event and listened.\n\nBowser said there was \"collective anxiety about what is coming.\" She said the women are expecting sexist attacks against Harris from political opponents. She logged on again on her way home. After putting her daughter to sleep and walking the family's dog, she logged on for a third time. The call, Bowser said, \"is indicative of what these women are going to do over the next several months.\"\n\nThe founder of Black Girls Vote, Nykidra \"Nyki\" Robinson, said she received the Zoom link about 15 times, starting at 3 p.m. After putting her two-year-old to sleep, she joined the call at 9:40 p.m.\n\n\"Sometimes we work in silos, but I felt a sense of community being on the call and feel better equipped to mobilize young voters,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope Joe Biden feels the love. We're grateful for him,\" Robinson said. \"We're also really excited to support Harris in this moment in history. The call was very much about sisterhood, unity and love.\"\n\nJane, a Black woman in Connecticut who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition that only her first name be published because she feared retribution from her employer, spent last night watching the Zoom call from her kitchen island on speakerphone as one of her 11-year-old sons listened in. He asked her whether Harris would be president, and she explained to him how the nomination process works.\n\nShe said she was glad her son saw a group of Black women come together so quickly to support each other.\n\n\"This is a message to the world,\" she said. \"Don't underestimate Black women in this country and the reach we have. Sometimes we're ignored, but you would want to be our friends because that's how fast we were able to get that information out. It was lightning speed.\"\n\nMariam Sarr logged on to the Zoom at 10 p.m. determined to make sure the Democratic Party does not \"skip over Harris.\"\n\n\"As a young Black woman in corporate America, I know what it feels like to be passed over. I feel energized in a way like I did in 2008. I actively campaigned for Obama when I was in college and hit the streets campaigning. Last night felt like the same way.\"\n\nOn Monday night, political commentator Roland Martin will host his own online discussion with the Win With Black Men group.\n\nStar Jones, who has known Harris for several years and is a founding member of Win With Black Women, was tasked with fundraising. As the creator of Brown Girls Fundraising Collective, Jones told The Post that she spent last night at a dinner with people working to see how they could fund Harris's campaign. She got a fundraising link together but had no graphics. Leaders of the Zoom call told her to join around 11:43 p.m.\n\nShe told the attendees the challenge was to raise $1 million over the next 100 days. She dropped the fundraising link at 11:50 p.m. \"Within 100 minutes we raised $1 million,\" Jones said.\n\nThe money will go directly to the Harris presidential campaign, according to Jones.\n\n\"People don't tend to think we actually have the power of the pocketbook,\" Jones said. \"So in addition to what we spend as consumers, we actually do give in a political climate when we feel we have skin in the game.\"\n\nAs of 1:30 p.m. Monday, Jones said they had raised more than $1.6 million dollars from more than 13,000 donors.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com",

Following President Joe Biden's announcement that he would not run for the Democratic nomination, the network Win with Black Women organized a Zoom call to show how prepared and determined black women were to take on this enormous challenge. The call, held on Sunday, was a powerful display of unity and determination, with Black women leaders from across the nation voicing their unwavering support for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe Zoom call reportedly drew an astounding 40,000 attendees and featured an impressive lineup of speakers, including Reps. Joyce Beatty, Maxine Waters, and Jasmine Crockett. The leaders passionately emphasized Black women's critical role in the upcoming election and shared personal stories about Harris that underscored her qualifications and leadership qualities. Other notable attendees included DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, Maryland Senate hopeful Angela Alsobrooks, civil rights leader Bernice King, and Black Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown.\n\nThe call highlighted the urgency of fundraising and voter registration as critical strategies for supporting Harris's campaign. The participants raised over $1 million during the call. \"We have a plan. This is not arbitrary. We are ready.\" asserted Holli Holiday, one of the call's moderators.\n\nEnthusiastic attendees expressed their readiness to work tirelessly to elect Harris. \"This is work. Roll up your sleeves; we got work to do,\" one attendee insisted. Another attendee declared, \"Fired up and ready for this moment led by an intergenerational legion of Black women.\n\n\"Let's get to work. Let's gather our sons, daughters, nieces, and nephews. Let's do what Black women do!\"\n\nAfter exiting the race, President Biden's made clear that his vice president should be the party's nominee. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president,\" Biden said. \"And it's been the best decision I've made. Today, I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be our party's nominee this year. Democrats, it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nIn the hours following Biden's announcement, Harris' campaign saw a surge of support, with about $50 million in grassroots donations pouring in. Democratic officials nationwide quickly followed Biden's lead, voicing their endorsements for Harris. Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina praised Harris, saying, \"Kamala Harris should be the next President. I've known her since our days as AGs, and she has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump and lead our country thoughtfully and with integrity.\"\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul of New York added her voice to the chorus of support: \"I'm proud to stand beside Kamala Harris. She is the right candidate to unite our country; I am confident she will deliver for New Yorkers. Let's get to work.\"\n\nGovernors Janet Mills of Maine, Gavin Newsom of California, and Jared Polis of Colorado echoed similar sentiments, highlighting Harris's capacity and readiness to lead.\n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin declared, \"I'm proud to endorse VP Kamala Harris for President. Today is a new beginning for our party and our country, and I'm excited to keep working together to lower costs for Wisconsin families, grow our Made in America economy, and restore our fundamental rights and freedoms.\"\n\nHarris has repeatedly stated the importance of the 2024 election. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "theskanner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Skanner News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stacy_m_brown@theskanner.com", "name": "Stacy M.

We've got 23 units in Washington alone,\" she said. \"You're going to see more folks engaged inside the process than I believe we did before with Biden. Folks are excited.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Vice President Kamala Harris has continued to rack up support from Black leaders in Congress and in Washington. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) declared support for Harris in the race, and the Congressional Black Caucus has followed suit. On Monday, 11 members of the Washington State Legislative Black Caucus joined in, delivering their \"enthusiastic\" endorsement of Harris, applauding her candidacy as \"history-making.\"\n\nHarris, if nominated, would become the first Black and South Asian American woman to run at the top of a major party's ticket for the presidency.\n\nDespite hosting Biden at its July convention, Secrest stated the NAACP will not officially endorse any candidate, but will instead focus on policies, namely police reform, diversity, equity and inclusion programs and violence prevention.\n\n'Disarray': KIRO, KTTH hosts comment on Biden withdrawal, Harris ascension\n\nSecrest still applauded the possibility of a Black woman securing the nomination, saying Harris is \"ready\" for the role.\n\n\"I understand what it's like for a Black woman to be able to showcase what we can do,\" Secrest said. \"Kamala Harris is distinguished in all her accomplishments.

Only 3% of the delegates were Black", "body": "Back in 2016, former President Donald Trump made a concession about the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe delegates and audience were not racially diverse enough, Trump said.\n\n\"The truth is, I didn't like it,\" Trump said during a television conversation with Bishop Wayne T. Jackson. \"With that being said, I don't like the job the Democrats have been doing representing African American people.\"\n\nSo how did the 2024 convention in Milwaukee stack up? Only slightly better.\n\nOnly 1,780 of 2,429 RNC delegates reported their ethnicity, according to convention officials. Of that number, 55 delegates said they were Black -- representing 3% of the those who provided this demographic information.\n\nThat number, while still very small, is up from 2016 when only 18 delegates reported that they were Black -- less than 1% of the total. That was the least amount of racial diversity in an RNC crowd in perhaps a hundred years.\n\nBy contrast, the peak year came in 2004, during the reelection effort for George W. Bush, according to the Washington Post. That year, nearly 7% of the Republican delegates were Black.\n\nOverall, Blacks make up about 14.4% of the American population, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn a statement, Republican officials played up the 300% increase in Black delegates since the last convention in 2016.\n\n\"The growing representation of different perspectives and backgrounds within the Big Tent GOP is indicative of the groundswell of support for President Donald J. Trump's vision to Make America Great Again,\" said RNC spokesman Kush Desai.\n\nBut Democrats said the numbers suggest that Trump's vision is not resonating with Black voters and other minority groups. Democratic President Joe Biden won more than 90% of the Black vote in 2020.\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic National Convention had 1,182 Black delegates out of 4,766 -- roughly 25% of the total. Vox reported that half of the Democratic delegates in 2016 were people of color while it was only 6% of Republicans.\n\nDemocrats hold their convention next month.\n\n\"Republicans offer lip service and photo ops in place of meaningful outreach to Black voters, while Trump's divisive rhetoric and insulting stereotypes -- like suggesting that Black voters support him more because he is a felon -- won't win over Black Wisconsinites in November,\" said DNC senior spokesman Marcus W. Robinson.\n\nBlack delegates offered differing views on the racial diversity at last week's convention in Milwaukee.\n\nScherie Murray, a delegate from New York who is Black, said he'd like to see more than 3% of the crowd being Black, yet at the same time, Murray said she never felt out of place at the convention.\n\nShe said she attended a number of events over the past week just for Black conservatives.\n\nBut Murray said Republicans can do more to boost its numbers, including greater civic engagement and more involvement in the Black community. She said GOP officials should emphasize the impact of Trump's 2017 tax cut on minority communities and their financial support for historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nAs for South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott's suggestion that America \"is not a racist country,\" Murray wasn't completely on board with him. She said she believes people, regardless of race, have the potential to be racist. But she added that class issues often get confused with racial ones.\n\nJerris Jackson, a delegate from California who is Black, said he didn't care how many delegates were Black.\n\n\"When I look at the crowd, I'm not really looking for people's race or color or ethnicity,\" he said while on the convention floor Thursday night. \"We're all Americans. We all want to make America great again.\"\n\nWhen asked about racism in society, Jackson pointed the finger at Democrats, saying they are responsible for discriminatory and racist policies over the years.\n\n\"I'm happy with the fact that Republicans are bringing in more people and broadening their base,\" said Rodney Harrison, a Tennessee delegate who is Black. He said he was seeing increasing racial diversity at the local level, too.\n\nSeveral of the Black delegates predicted that Trump would either double or triple his share of the Black vote in November.\n\nNot all Black officials walked away from the convention happy.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson says listening to Amber rose had his 'blood boiling'\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, the city's first elected Black mayor, on Friday said his \"blood was kind of boiling\" listening to model Amber Rose's speech as he sat in the convention hall. She proclaimed in her convention speech that she had concluded Trump was not racist.\n\nJohnson, a Democrat, spoke specifically about the music video to rap song \"Trump Trump Baby\" by rapper Forgiato Blow. Rose was featured in the video, too, wearing a gold chain with a gold Trump head, complete with red MAGA cap, attached to it.\n\nJohnson noted Blow's tattoos and the pair's gold chains, saying if they went to a conservative white neighborhood dressed like that someone would call the police on them.\n\n\"It's absolutely ridiculous, and it's not real,\" he said. \"They want these folks for their influence on other people of color and for their vote, but if they brought their true selves to those communities, to those neighborhoods, they'd be shunned.\"\n\nAsked if he worried about impact of speakers such as Scott on a national stage denying racism, Johnson said some Republicans seem like they don't want the history of racism to be told.\n\n\"As a Black person, I think about poor little Ruby Bridges going to school or the Little Rock Nine in Arkansas, and you see these vile images, these gross images of people just being racist and yelling just profanities and vulgarities and the N-word and all that stuff,\" he said, referencing Black students who integrated segregated schools.\n\n\"They want to erase that ... but that's important so we don't forget it,\" he continued. \"If we really want to have racial healing in this country then we can't forget what happened in the past. We can't forget that.\"", "source": {"uri": "sheboyganpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sheboygan Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

And the Black church has played an integral role in getting voters energized and out to the polls.\n\nWith his admittedly poor performance in his debate with former President Donald Trump, lackluster showing in the polls and questions about his health at age 81, many prominent Democrats and others have asked Biden to abandon his reelection bid.

Jackson is steadfast is in his support for a Biden/ Harris ticket. \"I think the important thing is that people vote in their best interest and I don't see where Donald Trump represents the best interest of African Americans, people of color or the nation.\" He said he isn't worried that Biden will step aside, but even if he does it doesn't change things. \"I don't think it changes who we support or our need to support whomever is the nominee of the Democratic Party,\" Jackson said.\n\nSome Black clergy and congregants who spoke to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said the uncertainty over whether Biden will stay in the race and a lack of enthusiasm from voters has hindered their efforts to mobilize voters.\n\n\"We don't have anything to sink our teeth into,\" said the Rev. Shanan Jones, president of Concerned Black Clergy of Metropolitan Atlanta, which has about 120 affiliated churches. \"People are looking to us, (asking) is he going to get out of the race or not? It's confusing. Black clergy are pulling together to create our own strategy to save democracy.\"\n\nHe said there should be more clarity and better messaging from Democrats, although most Black Americans still support the Biden and Harris ticket. And he believes they will favor Harris for the top spot if Biden does step away.\n\nWhether Biden remains the Democratic nominee or not, the eventual nominee is likely to get most of the Black voters who still choose to vote.\n\nJason E. Shelton, director of the Center for African American Studies at the University of Texas, Arlington, said Black churches will always be seen as an anchor in the community and an advocate for voter education and mobilization.\n\nAmong church congregants, \"the majority of African Americans are still going to vote Democrat,\" he said. \"What is different this time around is less about the church and more about the candidates. There's something on both sides that's unique about them. For Trump, many African Americans are adamantly opposed to his candidacy. But some affluent African Americans feel that they stand to benefit from his economic policies. As for Biden, most African Americans will support his candidacy. They remember his loyalty to former President Obama, so they will be loyal to him.\"\n\nShelton said Black voters from religious traditions like Baptists, Methodists and Pentecostal are most likely to vote for Democratic presidential candidates.\n\n\"No less than 80% of their adherents vote Democratic,\" said Shelton, author of the the soon-to-be-published book, \"The Contemporary Black Church: The New Dynamics of African American Religion.\"\n\nBut while the majority of Black voters lean Democrat, the Republican Party is becoming more attractive to some voters of color.\n\nRecent polling for the AJC shows that under Trump, the Republican Party has cut into Democrats' hold on voters of color. In June, only 69% of Black survey respondents said they planned to vote for Biden with another 18% undecided or planning to support a third-party candidate.\n\nCompare that with 2020, where CNN exit polling indicated that 88% of Black voters in Georgia had supported Biden. The AJC polling shows Black voters in Georgia support Trump at nearly the same level in 2024 as 2020.\n\n\"I'm talking to pastors and all the pastors I've talked to are fully onboard with him (Biden),\" said the Rev. Cynthia Hale, senior pastor of Ray of Hope Christian Church in Decatur, which has a weekly Sunday attendance of 500 people. \"This is where we've been since the beginning.\"\n\nFor her part, Hale said she will continue to be supportive of the party and Biden, but she's worried about his health. Her church has had long standing voter outreach that has already begun and will continue through the election in November. \"There are a lot of conversations taking place, especially targeting the young people on the whole idea of voting,\" said Hale.\n\nA big problem for Democrats, she said, is if Biden steps aside, and Vice President Kamala Harris does not rise to the top of the ticket.\n\nAudraine Jackson, an Atlanta public relations executive and founder of the J&V Cares Foundation, has been a life-long member of Big Bethel AMC in Atlanta.\n\nThe church, she said, has a long history of encouraging its members to vote. Her mother was a voting rights advocate and a brother used to stand by the door before and after services, to hand out voter registration cards. The AMC denomination of more than 7,000 congregations nationwide has a long history of pushing self-determination and that includes voting.\n\n\"Every pastor at Big Bethel has advocated for voting,\" she said. \"They didn't tell us how to vote, but they said we needed to vote.\"\n\n\"I am true blue,\" said Darlene Hudson, CEO of a nonprofit organization that works primarily with the Black LGBTQ+ community. ... \"Whatever the Democrats have put in place that's what I'm going with. It can be Biden/Kamala or Kamala/whomever.\"\n\nIf Biden steps aside and Harris does not rise to the top of the ticket. Hudson said she may be disappointed but \"I would understand, I think we have a lot of field work to do before we have a female president. I feel she's capable but there's still a lot of gender bias.\"\n\nToday, though, Black churches are facing more challenges, said Eric McDaniel, a professor in the government department and co-director of the Politics of Race and Ethnicity Lab at the University of Texas, including a decline in attendance that means churches are diverting some of the focus to keep their doors open. The decline is linked in large part to the pandemic, when many services were livestreamed and in some cases congregants never came back inside the church, if at all.\n\nA recent study by the Pew Research Center found that roughly 46% of Black Protestants said they attend religious services once a month, a drop of 15% from 2019.\n\n\"This will lead to a reduce role in community activities, such as voter mobilization,\" he said.\n\nHe said there appears to be a lack of enthusiasm, which he said also happened in 2016.\n\nHowever, he believes churches will pick up the pace, the closer it gets to November, but he worries that could be too late.\n\n\"If they want people to get out and vote, they need to start working on the unenthused or disconnected now, so that they are ready in November,\" he said. \"Also, a lot of this may hinge on the lack of effort on the part of the parties. If the parties are actively mobilizing voters and clergy, we should expect the churches to follow. We should expect a flurry of mobilization after the party conventions.\"\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Visit at ajc.com.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were concerned that eliminating Biden wouldn't result in automatic donor support for Kamala Harris, a Black woman. But Harris' entry into the race injected a shot of energy and money into what had become a demoralizing Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nAs many as 44,000 Black women joined a Win With Black Women Zoom call and, in just three hours, raised more than one million dollars for Harris. ActBlue, a Democratic fundraising platform, tweeted that 46.7 million dollars flowed into Kamala Harris's campaign in 7 hours, making Sunday the \"biggest fundraising day of the 2024 cycle.\"\n\nThere are many issues Black women face, from challenges to reproductive freedoms to staggering student loan debt to aggressive policing that disrupts our families and community. So what would a Harris presidency mean for Black women?\n\nReproductive Rights\n\nHarris has been a staunch advocate for reproductive rights. On the 51st anniversary of Roe earlier this year, Harris launched a multi-city tour in support of reproductive freedom. In her first stop on the tour in the swing state of Wisconsin, she explained in a CNN interview that Trump was proud of what he'd done to decimate women's rights and much more was at stake if he was re-elected \"By inference, he is proud that women have been deprived of fundamental freedoms to make decisions about their own body; by inference, proud that doctors are being penalized and criminalized for providing health care, proud that women are silently suffering because they don't have access to the health care they need,\" Harris added. \"So, let's understand that the stakes are so very high.\"\n\nHarris also touted measures the Biden administration had taken to protect reproductive freedom, including increased access to contraception for federal employees and increased the number of approved medications available for free under the Affordable Care Act, as reported by US News & World Report.\n\nAlexis McGill Johnson, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, celebrated Harris as a champion for reproductive rights: \"I've had the unique privilege of working and, more recently, campaigning with Vice President Kamala Harris, and I have been proud to watch her rise as one of the fiercest voices we have on sexual and reproductive rights.\n\n\"As a lawyer, an attorney general, a senator, a vice president, and as a Black woman -- Vice President Harris understands what's ahead of us. She knows what it means for Black women to have less reproductive freedom in a country where we are more vulnerable to everything from maternal mortality to criminalization, and she fights like it,\" McGill said in a statement to ESSENCE.\n\nEconomic Policy\n\nHarris is also a fighter when it comes to creating economic opportunity for low and middle-class families. For example, during her first presidential campaign, she proposed a tax credit of up to $6000 for married couples making less than $100,000, which would be paid for by rolling back tax cuts made by the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and taxing some financial institutions, as reported by PBS. Additionally, she's promoted the Biden administration's economic policies, which include the bipartisan infrastructure bill, funding for small businesses, capping the cost of insulin to $35, and limiting the amount of out-of-pocket expenses for prescriptions to $2000 for Medicare enrollees as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Plus, Harris has championed student loan forgiveness, which would have a significant impact on the Black community since Black people graduate with far more student loan debt than their white counterparts and take much longer to repay those debts, according to reporting by PBS.\n\nRose Pierre-Louis, Executive Director of NYU McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research, said that this is a major moment that transcends politics and shows Black women and girls what's possible. \"This is a historic moment -- not just in politics, but for Black women and girls across the nation. At the McSilver Institute, we support communities fortified by generations of Black women who have worked tirelessly to uplift and create opportunities for success despite enduring histories of oppression, violence, and neglect,' Pierre-Louis told ESSENCE.\" Vice President Harris embodies the countless years of individual and community effort in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. We have long assured Black girls that they can be the President of the United States one day. For the first time, we have a real opportunity to make good on that promise.\"\n\nGun Control\n\nVice President Harris has been a vocal supporter of increased gun control, stemming back to her days as attorney general of California when she launched an initiative to confiscate weapons statewide from those illegally owning them. As a senator, she co-sponsored a bill to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines (those that can fire more than 10 rounds before reloading). And as part of the Biden administration she worked to enact the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA), the most significant piece of gun control legislation in 30 years. Among its provisions, it includes funding for red flag law programs (this allows a judge to temporarily confiscate weapons from someone who is having a mental health crisis and appears to be a danger to himself or other people), expands mental health services access and expands community violence intervention programs. Vice President Harris has also taken the lead on the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which has closed the gun-show loophole by requiring all gun dealers to conduct background checks regardless of where they sell their merchandise.\n\nRacial Justice And DEI\n\nHarris was one of several senators who introduced the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act. As Essence reported, the bill would have ended qualified immunity for police officers, included de-escalation training for officers, created a national database for police misconduct, and more readily allowed the Justice Department to prosecute officers for civil rights violations.\n\nCiting the disproportionate impact the criminal justice system has on Black people, Harris has also called for ending mandatory minimums, cash bail and the death penalty since the murder of George Floyd. But in her previous role as a prosecutor, she wasn't always as progressive and once pushed for higher cash bails and refused to support independent investigations for police shootings as reported by the NY Times. When asked about her evolution, she said, \"I was swimming against the current, and thankfully, the currents have changed; the winds are in our sails. And I'm riding that just like everybody else is -- because it's long overdue.\"\n\nBlack women, the backbone of the Democratic party, are largely supporting Harris' historic run, and Democratic leaders are falling in line. Not only have all 50 state Democratic party chairs thrown their support behind Harris, but previous Biden supporters like Bill and Hillary Clinton and James Clyburn (who famously revived Biden's moribund campaign in 2020) have all endorsed VP Harris.\n\nBernice King, daughter of the late Dr. Martin Luther King and CEO of the King Center, also wholeheartedly supported Harris, posting on X: \"We are in dire need of a President who ensures that the civil rights that my parents and many others so courageously work for to further the Beloved Community are not obliterated. For that reason, I deem this presidential election a legacy vote. We must protect our legacy of persistence for civil rights and deter efforts to roll back rights.\"\n\nShe continued, \"With these beliefs in mind, I support VP Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and call on all my sorors of AKA, HBCU graduates, members of the Divine Nine and protectors of democracy to join me in getting this done\"\n\nThat spirit of camaraderie and collectively having Harris' proverbial back was echoed across social media. On Instagram, political strategist Alencia Johnson posted a picture of herself standing proudly next to VP Harris with the caption, \"So we're clear. The absolute only choice, and that's Vice President Kamala Harris for President. Will do everything possible to ensure we inaugurate our first Black woman president.\"\n\nEven with enthusiasm from the Democratic base, though, Black women know all too well the sexist and racist attacks that VP Harris will face as the campaign progresses, but despite the challenges, women like Johnson think Harris can defeat Donald Trump.\n\n\"Hours after the announcement that she's running, the energy from Black women voters is palpable. It means something that the backbone of the Democratic party is already in formation -- ready to coalesce around the Vice President and keep her lifted for what will be a challenging, but winnable, fight ahead,\" she said.\n\nNow that VP Harris' candidacy for President is nearly assured-with support extending from the grassroots all the way to the White House-the real work begins to defeat Donald Trump, ensure no element of Project 2025 comes to fruition and preserve and extend the rights that Black women have fought so hard for. From Shirley Chisholm's \"Unbought and Unbossed\" campaign as the first Black woman to run for President in 1972 to Kamala Harris today, U.S. democracy owes a debt of gratitude to Black women's efforts, let's hope the rest of the nation joins us in the fight.", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Essence (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Student debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_McGill_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexis McGill Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActBlue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ActBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_&_World_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. News & World Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Only 3% of the delegates were Black\n\nDaniel Bice, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nJuly 22, 2024 at 5:09 PM\n\nMILWAUKEE - Back in 2016, former President Donald Trump made a concession about the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe delegates and audience were not racially diverse enough, Trump said.\n\n\"The truth is, I didn't like it,\" Trump said during a television conversation with Bishop Wayne T. Jackson. \"With that being said, I don't like the job the Democrats have been doing representing African American people.\"\n\nSo how did the 2024 convention in Milwaukee stack up? Only slightly better.\n\nOnly 1,780 of 2,429 RNC delegates reported their ethnicity, according to convention officials. Of that number, 55 delegates said they were Black -- representing 3% of the those who provided this demographic information.\n\nThat number, while still very small, is up from 2016 when only 18 delegates reported that they were Black -- less than 1% of the total. That was the least amount of racial diversity in an RNC crowd in perhaps a hundred years.\n\nBy contrast, the peak year came in 2004, during the reelection effort for George W. Bush, according to the Washington Post. That year, nearly 7% of the Republican delegates were Black.\n\nOverall, Blacks make up about 14.4% of the American population, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn a statement, Republican officials played up the 300% increase in Black delegates since the last convention in 2016.\n\n\"The growing representation of different perspectives and backgrounds within the Big Tent GOP is indicative of the groundswell of support for President Donald J. Trump's vision to Make America Great Again,\" said RNC spokesman Kush Desai.\n\nBut Democrats said the numbers suggest that Trump's vision is not resonating with Black voters and other minority groups. Democratic President Joe Biden won more than 90% of the Black vote in 2020.\n\nIn 2016, the Democratic National Convention had 1,182 Black delegates out of 4,766 -- roughly 25% of the total. Vox reported that half of the Democratic delegates in 2016 were people of color while it was only 6% of Republicans.\n\nDemocrats hold their convention next month.\n\n\"Republicans offer lip service and photo ops in place of meaningful outreach to Black voters, while Trump's divisive rhetoric and insulting stereotypes -- like suggesting that Black voters support him more because he is a felon -- won't win over Black Wisconsinites in November,\" said DNC senior spokesman Marcus W. Robinson.\n\nBlack delegates offered differing views on the racial diversity at last week's convention in Milwaukee.\n\nScherie Murray, a delegate from New York who is Black, said he'd like to see more than 3% of the crowd being Black, yet at the same time, Murray said she never felt out of place at the convention.\n\nShe said she attended a number of events over the past week just for Black conservatives.\n\nBut Murray said Republicans can do more to boost its numbers, including greater civic engagement and more involvement in the Black community. She said GOP officials should emphasize the impact of Trump's 2017 tax cut on minority communities and their financial support for historically Black colleges and universities.\n\nAs for South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott's suggestion that America \"is not a racist country,\" Murray wasn't completely on board with him. She said she believes people, regardless of race, have the potential to be racist. But she added that class issues often get confused with racial ones.\n\nJerris Jackson, a delegate from California who is Black, said he didn't care how many delegates were Black.\n\n\"When I look at the crowd, I'm not really looking for people's race or color or ethnicity,\" he said while on the convention floor Thursday night. \"We're all Americans. We all want to make America great again.\"\n\nWhen asked about racism in society, Jackson pointed the finger at Democrats, saying they are responsible for discriminatory and racist policies over the years.\n\n\"I'm happy with the fact that Republicans are bringing in more people and broadening their base,\" said Rodney Harrison, a Tennessee delegate who is Black. He said he was seeing increasing racial diversity at the local level, too.\n\nSeveral of the Black delegates predicted that Trump would either double or triple his share of the Black vote in November.\n\nNot all Black officials walked away from the convention happy.\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson says listening to Amber rose had his 'blood boiling'\n\nMilwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, the city's first elected Black mayor, on Friday said his \"blood was kind of boiling\" listening to model Amber Rose's speech as he sat in the convention hall. She proclaimed in her convention speech that she had concluded Trump was not racist.\n\nJohnson, a Democrat, spoke specifically about the music video to rap song \"Trump Trump Baby\" by rapper Forgiato Blow. Rose was featured in the video, too, wearing a gold chain with a gold Trump head, complete with red MAGA cap, attached to it.\n\nJohnson noted Blow's tattoos and the pair's gold chains, saying if they went to a conservative white neighborhood dressed like that someone would call the police on them.\n\n\"It's absolutely ridiculous, and it's not real,\" he said. \"They want these folks for their influence on other people of color and for their vote, but if they brought their true selves to those communities, to those neighborhoods, they'd be shunned.\"\n\nAsked if he worried about impact of speakers such as Scott on a national stage denying racism, Johnson said some Republicans seem like they don't want the history of racism to be told.\n\n\"As a Black person, I think about poor little Ruby Bridges going to school or the Little Rock Nine in Arkansas, and you see these vile images, these gross images of people just being racist and yelling just profanities and vulgarities and the N-word and all that stuff,\" he said, referencing Black students who integrated segregated schools.\n\n\"They want to erase that ... but that's important so we don't forget it,\" he continued. \"If we really want to have racial healing in this country then we can't forget what happened in the past. We can't forget that.\"\n\nAlison Dirr of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.\n\nContact Daniel Bice at (414) 313-6684 or dbice@jrn.com.

Rose was featured in the video, too, wearing a gold chain with a gold Trump head, complete with red MAGA cap, attached to it.\n\nJohnson noted Blow's tattoos and the pair's gold chains, saying if they went to a conservative white neighborhood dressed like that someone would call the police on them.\n\n\"It's absolutely ridiculous, and it's not real,\" he said. \"They want these folks for their influence on other people of color and for their vote, but if they brought their true selves to those communities, to those neighborhoods, they'd be shunned.\"\n\nAsked if he worried about impact of speakers such as Scott on a national stage denying racism, Johnson said some Republicans seem like they don't want the history of racism to be told.\n\n\"As a Black person, I think about poor little Ruby Bridges going to school or the Little Rock Nine in Arkansas, and you see these vile images, these gross images of people just being racist and yelling just profanities and vulgarities and the N-word and all that stuff,\" he said, referencing Black students who integrated segregated schools.\n\n\"They want to erase that ... but that's important so we don't forget it,\" he continued. \"If we really want to have racial healing in this country then we can't forget what happened in the past. We can't forget that.\"\n\nAlison Dirr of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.\n\nContact Daniel Bice at (414) 313-6684 or dbice@jrn.com.

Kamala Harris And The American Presidency", "body": "July 21, 2024, marked an unprecedented moment in American history. Just a week after the Republican National Convention and weeks before the Democratic Convention, with only 107 days remaining until the November 5th election, President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal from the campaign and endorsed his Vice President, Kamala Harris. This historic decision has prompted the nation to confront a pivotal question: Are we ready to elect the first female, first South Asian, and first African American woman of immigrant parents to the highest office in the land?\n\nTo understand the historic importance of Harris's candidacy, and to answer that question, we must understand that Harris stands on the shoulders of generations of women who came before her. Harris's path to the White House has been paved over centuries of women's work and Black women's leadership, much of which has been ignored in the media and only recently added to our history books because of the flourishing field of Black Women's History.\n\nBut Harris isn't the first woman and not even the first Black woman to aspire to lead our nation. She certainly is not the first qualified for this role. Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to serve in the US Congress, ran for the Democratic nomination for President in 1972 building the foundation for this moment. Chisholm was a candidate for the \"people of America,\" and so is the Vice President. When Harris ran for President in 2020, her campaign theme echoed Chisholm, and now, her \"For The People\" t-shirts and signs have made a wide and organic resurgence overnight across the internet. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was the first woman to be the nominee for one of the major parties. Might we see a second next month?\n\nHarris has been preparing for this role throughout her professional career as an attorney, a senator, a California Attorney General, and Vice President of the United States. Being chosen as Biden's running mate in 2020 was important to her political trajectory and it was an important moment in the history of women in the US. Black women have served as the backbone of our nation's moral, social, and political compass for generations. Even before Black women had the right to vote, they campaigned, canvassed, and supported local, state and national elections. During slavery, women including Maria Stewart, an African American abolitionist and women's rights advocate, expressed their dissatisfaction with American politics and spoke publicly in front of multifarious audiences. When legislation limited their abilities, they resisted. Sojourner Truth testified in front of a grand jury to fight for the rights of her community. In the aftermath of slavery, leaders like Ida B. Wells Barnett and thousands of suffragists voted with their feet by marching, protesting, and boycotting, finding creative ways to participate in a political process that initially excluded them.\n\nToday, over 140 women hold federal political offices in the United States, including 25 senators and 120 representatives. Women from both parties are shaping key legislation on reproductive rights, immigration, diversity, equity, and inclusion. Vice President Harris emphasizes the critical nature of this election for the future of American democracy. As the late Representative Sheila Jackson Lee stated: 'The minority must have involvement in society. You can have different cultural practices that you accept. But if you are going to adopt democracy in government, then the government itself must allow the minority to be heard.'\"\n\nHarris has risen to power at a time when more women hold political offices; more women sit in the C-Suite; more women lead academic institutions; and more women serve as justices of the Supreme Court.\n\nDespite these gains, Black women have been at the center of a political backlash in the United States. Black women candidates, in particular, have been scrutinized, attacked, and harassed with microscopic precision. This backlash takes place in business and society. Some industries such as the entertainment industry are releasing Black women from leadership positions. In some states, governors are using new DEI legislation to eliminate Black women's gains across the public sector and at public universities. Even private sector companies aligned with politicians succumbed to pressure to turn back the clock. See Tractor Supply Company's recent 180 on DEI.\n\nYesterday, social media quickly became flooded with false narratives about Harris' rise focused on her gender, nationality and ethnicity. This is nothing new. She has been dealing with this for her entire career.\n\nAs Vice President, Harris vowed to support the President and to be prepared to serve in that capacity should the situation arise. The situation arose yesterday and today, she secured enough support for the nomination breaking records in presidential campaign fundraising.\n\nThose who question if America is ready for a South Asian, African American woman, likely haven't studied American women's history and do not have an understanding of the adversity women have overcome. Generations of Black women, for example, endured capture, the Middle Passage across the Atlantic, enslavement, rape, family separation and gender plus racially-motivated violence for decades. They fought back. They resisted in overt and covert ways; in groups and alone. They resisted by refusing their labor, refusing to bear children, by committing infanticide to prevent the enslavement of their offspring, by taking their own lives, by shipping themselves to freedom, and by suing for their freedom: in every way possible Black women resisted and survived. They were crucial to the Civil Rights movement even if the credit was given to the men they supported. And they were the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nToday, Black women serve our country in millions of leadership positions as mayors, as state legislators, and as members of the House of Representatives and the US Senate. They lead their communities and serve our nation with humility and respect. Many of these women have been elected by focusing on issues of gender equity, economic opportunity and reproductive justice, all issues that are likely to be front and center in the next five months.\n\nWhether America is ready for Kamala Harris as President will depend on which version of history voters embrace. Are we a nation committed to progress and inclusivity, or are we yearning for a bygone era? The candidacy of Kamala Harris will answer that question.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Chisholm", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shirley Chisholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_W._Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maria W.

Now that President Joe Biden has stepped down from the 2024 presidential race, Harris has become his top potential successor in what is already set to be a historic election.\n\nHarris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, has already garnered the endorsement of major political action committees and advocacy groups representing Asian, Pacific Islander, Black and Latino voters.\n\nIn a statement, the AAPI Victory Fund called Harris the \"best choice to win this November.\"\n\n\"We will fight with all of our might to make her the first South Asian and Black woman ever to serve as president of the United States,\" said Shekar Narasimhan, the fund's chairman and founder, and Joe Nguy\u1ec5n, president and CEO.\n\nThe Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA) told ABC News that Harris \"represents the epitome of resilience, leadership and historic achievement.\"\n\n\"Vice President Harris' journey mirrors the struggles and triumphs of countless women of color who have navigated systemic barriers to ascend to positions of influence,\" the statement continued. \"Her leadership and dedication to justice, equality and representation are aligned with BWOPA's mission to empower Black women and promote political engagement.\"\n\nLatino Victory Board Chairman Luis A. Miranda, Jr. called Biden's decision to step down \"selfless\" and said they \"previously endorsed Vice President Harris for VP, and we look forward to continue working closely with her to ensure Latino voices are reflected in government, and that our issues continue to be prioritized in the 2024 presidential campaign.\"\n\nWomen's groups also chimed in amid the wave of endorsements:\n\n\"In this historic moment for our country, we have the opportunity to not only elect a proven, qualified leader who is ready on Day One to fight for families and hold those in power accountable -- but also to elect the first-ever woman president,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund, in a statement.\n\nHarris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, immigrated to the U.S. in 1958 for postgraduate studies at the age of 19 and married Jamaican immigrant Donald Harris six years later. Gopalan Harris raised the vice president and her sister herself following a divorce from Donald Harris in 1971.\n\n\"As many of you may know, my mother arrived in the United States from India when she was 19 years old, by herself, never having been to America. My mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters -- my sister, Maya, and me -- and to end breast cancer,\" said Harris at an AAPI celebration in May. \"My mother never asked anyone's permission to pursue her dreams. And it is because of her character, strength and determination that within one generation I stand before you as vice president of the United States.\"\n\nHarris has long embraced the two sides of her heritage -- highlighted in her recollections of attending a historically Black university, weaving Hindu traditions into her wedding ceremony, joining both the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus, and more.\n\nStill, Harris has been criticized by some South Asian and Black voters who believe she has uplifted one identity more than the other. Others argue she has not advocated for her communities enough, in some cases saying they felt \"neglected.\"\n\nIn a 2020 op-ed written by Sadanand Dhume for the Wall Street Journal, the author accuses Harris of failing to highlight some details about where her family is from because of political conflicts.\n\n\"In her book, Ms. Harris airbrushes her mother's community from her story. The words Tamil and Brahmin don't appear at all. At one point the senator mentions that Gopalan won an award for her singing in India, but not that it was for Carnatic music, a classical art form closely associated with Tamil Brahmins,\" Dhume writes.\n\nWhen asked about critics who question the \"legitimacy\" of her Blackness in an interview on the Breakfast Club, Harris responded: \"If you walked on Hampton's campus or Howard's campus or Morehouse or Spelman or Fisk, you would have a much better appreciation for the diaspora, for the diversity, for the beauty in the diversity of who we are as Black people.\"\n\nIn 2020, Natalie Masuoka, Department of Asian American Studies chair at UCLA, argued that Harris' identity was going to shift the way Americans think about race and identity.\n\n\"Multiracial identification encourages us to think about how complex racial identity can be for many Americans,\" Masuoka said in her essay. \"This opens opportunities to have constructive conversations about how race impacts individual life chances.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAPI_Victory_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AAPI Victory Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Harris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald J.

But in interviews in Atlanta, where voters helped flip Georgia for Democrats four years ago, some black voters were nervous.\n\n\"People really don't like women, especially black women,\" said Mary Jameson, 46. \"If a white woman can't win, how can a black woman win?\"\n\nCarrington Jackson, a 23-year-old chiropractic student from Marietta, Georgia, said she immediately felt fearful when Biden dropped out. Though she believes Harris is a great candidate, she worries about her facing not only the popularity of the GOP nominee, former President Donald Trump, but the prejudices of the American public.\n\n\"With me being a black woman, I understand that she's at the intersection of sexism and racism,\" Jackson said. \"I think now that's going to be a whole other battle as well as competing against Donald Trump's supporters.\"\n\nAn AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll fielded prior to Biden's announcement Sunday found that about six in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do well as president. More broadly, among all adults, the poll showed skepticism of Harris, with only three in 10 Americans saying she would do well as president.\n\nBut blacks were more likely to see Harris in a positive light.\n\nMany Democrats followed Biden's lead in expressing their support for Harris. The Congressional Black Caucus said it \"fully backs\" the vice president.\n\nAnd some black voters, dismayed by what they saw as Biden's dwindling chance of winning in November, said they would support whoever could best compete with Trump.\n\n\"If they can express the policy of the Democratic Party better than Biden, then I will gladly take that person,\" said Pierre Varlet, 30, an anti-money laundering specialist in Atlanta.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Native Americans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decatur,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decatur, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Decatur, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/07/23/2876857/8085737.jpg?itok=-fzevUM0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

This powerful show of support came just a day after over 40,000 Black women joined in a similar Zoom call, generating about $2 million for Harris and sending a resounding message of solidarity and resolve.\n\nThe men's call, led by Martin and co-hosted by Bakari Sellers and others, was a powerful statement against former President Donald Trump, who has been twice impeached and convicted of 34 felonies. Martin, visibly moved, tweeted, \"I have no words. And not just because I'm tired. My @BlkStarNetwork just told me that 53,862 people registered for our #WinWithBlackMen video call. We raised $1.3 million and counting from 17,000 donors.\"\n\nBakari Sellers shared a poignant story that underscored Harris's compassion and unwavering support. He recounted a harrowing time in 2019 when one of his twin daughters was born with a rare liver condition. \"The first person to call me was Kamala Harris. I am not sure people understand the pain and suffering that goes along with being a Black man in this country,\" Sellers said.\n\n\"I am not sure people understand what it means to stand strong in this country. To have your back against the wall. But I am going to stand with her because she stood with me during my darkest moment when I almost lost my daughter. When I had to protect my wife.\"\n\nThe Zoom call resonated with the slogan, \"We Rocking with Kamala Harris,\" reflecting the participants' unyielding support. This extraordinary event followed President Joe Biden's announcement that he would not seek the Democratic nomination, prompting the Win with Black Women network to organize a Zoom call showcasing their preparedness to back Harris.\n\nThe women's call drew a stunning 40,000 attendees and featured influential speakers such as Reps. Joyce Beatty, Maxine Waters, and Jasmine Crockett. These leaders passionately emphasized the vital role of Black women in the upcoming election and shared compelling stories about Harris that highlighted her qualifications and leadership qualities. Distinguished attendees included DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, Maryland Senate hopeful Angela Alsobrooks, civil rights leader Bernice King, and Black Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown. \"We have a plan. This is not arbitrary. We are ready,\" asserted Holli Holiday, one of the call's moderators.\n\nThe energy was electric, with attendees voicing their readiness to work tirelessly to elect Harris. \"This is work. Roll up your sleeves; we got work to do,\" one attendee urged. Another declared, \"Fired up and ready for this moment led by an intergenerational legion of Black women. Let's get to work. Let's gather our sons, daughters, nieces, and nephews. Let's do what Black women do!\"\n\nIn a less-publicized yet equally significant gathering, a large group of Black men and boys convened in Atlanta to discuss the state of America and the importance of Harris's candidacy against Trump in the 2024 election. These weekly discussions are critical for spreading accurate information and countering misinformation.\n\n\"The reason that we've gathered tonight is that there is so much misinformation, disinformation, that is being put out. So, we wanted thought leaders from across the political spectrum to come in tonight and talk directly to Black men about what they know, what they experience, and what some of the real statistics and facts are,\" said Attorney Mawuli Mel Davis, co-founder of the non-profit hosting these discussions. \"That's critically important because the sources of our information are important for us to make sure that we're basing our decisions on good quality information.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman-recorder.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakari_Sellers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bakari Sellers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Martin_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roland Martin (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Crockett", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Crockett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Beatty", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joyce Beatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Alsobrooks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Alsobrooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernice_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernice King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Bowser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muriel Bowser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://spokesman-recorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TWITTER-BLACK-MEN-FOR-HARRIS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But will other voters rally behind her?", "body": "Ernie Suggs | (TNS) The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nATLANTA -- When President Joe Biden was in Atlanta for the May commencement ceremonies for Morehouse College, he praised and teased the graduates of the all-male school telling them that he did not doubt that \"a Morehouse Man will be president one day.\"\n\nThe president let the applause build and die down a bit before delivering the punchline.\n\n\"Just after an AKA from Howard,\" he quipped.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden laid the path for that member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority from Howard University when he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed him atop the Democratic Party's ticket for the November presidential election.\n\nIn a statement, Harris thanked Biden for the endorsement and vowed to \"earn and win this nomination.\"\n\n\"We have 107 days until Election Day,\" Harris wrote. \"Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nIf she is ultimately chosen, Harris would be the first African American woman, first Asian American woman, and first graduate of a historically Black college to lead a party's ticket.\n\n\"Which is not unimportant,\" said Kerry Haynie, a professor of political science at Duke University and dean of the school's department of social sciences. \"Having a woman of color at the top of the ticket sends a significant message when the other side has traded in race bating and xenophobia.\"\n\nIn the weeks following President Biden's Atlanta visit and his disastrous debate with Donald Trump, the loud whispers for Harris to replace him on the ticket grew, even as she downplayed it, refusing to engage in commentary about anything other than running alongside him.\n\nBut with Biden dropping out and strongly endorsing her, she now has no choice.\n\nNeither did the list of prominent Democrats who are lining up to support her.\n\n\"It is the right decision, the only decision the Democrats could have made and have a chance of winning,\" said Haynie, the co-author of \"Race, Gender, and Political Representation: Toward a More Intersectional Approach. \"It would have been too disruptive to not place Harris at the top of the ticket. A Black woman. A woman of color who is currently the vice president. They would have lost their base if it was someone other than Kamala Harris.\"\n\nThat base is Black women. Long considered the backbone of the Democratic Party, Black women will again play a major role in the November election.\n\nIn 2020, more than 91% of Black women who voted, supported the Biden-Harris ticket. And while some polls suggested that Biden was losing Black male voters, those same polls show that Black women were still fully behind him.\n\nSilva Howard, who is visiting Atlanta from the battleground state of Michigan, said Harris has her full support.\n\n\" (Black women) are the smartest people on the planet. For us to run the country would be amazing because we know what it takes to not only run a country but to run a family,\" said Howard, before walking into the Janet Jackson concert Sunday night at State Farm Arena. \"We are the backbone. The Black woman is the backbone of the United States.\"\n\nHaynie said with Harris now serving as the party's presumptive nominee, the Democrats can move forward against the Republicans, rather than having been mired in the intraparty turmoil that has dominated the conversation over the last three weeks about whether Biden should step aside.\n\n\"Biden endorsing her was very important,\" Haynie said. \"They will get the party behind her. Now they must take advantage of the strong infrastructure they have put together to turn it into a Harris-led machine.\"\n\nHarris sought the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2020, but dropped out before a single primary vote had been cast because her campaign lacked money, a message and a cohesive strategy. Even after Biden picked her to run as his vice president, her first two years of office were marked by missteps.\n\nBut after the Supreme Court decision overturning the right to abortion enshrined in Roe v. Wade, she became one of the most vocal and prominent advocates for abortion rights and women's rights.\n\nShe was also Biden's most ardent defender after his debate debacle, rallying around him when other high-profile Democrats called for him to step aside.\n\nOn Sunday, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, issued a statement on social media Sunday endorsing Harris.\n\nSo did Georgia Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who were joined by Congresswoman Lucy McBath and former Atlanta Mayor and Biden adviser Keisha Lance Bottoms in endorsing Harris.\n\n\"They recognize the risks the party would undertake if they passed over Harris. Changing candidates will not erase Democrats' current disadvantage relative to Donald Trump, and if it looked like Harris was passed over against her will, that would almost certainly depress Black voter turnout and guarantee that Democrats would lose the presidency,\" said Emory University political scientist Andra Gillespie.\n\n\"We'll have to wait to see if others submit their name for consideration in the next few days. In the meantime, the hard work begins of working through the DNC's procedures to ensure a legal and optically sound transfer of the nomination.\"\n\nEmory University law professor Alicia Hughes agrees that -- with recent Supreme Court rulings, ballot certification deadlines, and the upcoming Democratic National Convention -- the naming of Harris was the \"most strategic and intelligent decision\" that could have been made.\n\n\"It puts [the Democratic Party] in a position where they are able to ensure that they stay out of the courts,\" Hughes said. \"It ensures a modicum of consistency.\"\n\nBut that is just the beginning.\n\nHughes said while the \"path of least resistance,\" is to have Harris at the top of the ticket, conversations are going on about who would be on the ticket with her or even if someone else should carry the party's banner.\n\n\"The concern is who is in a position to beat the Republicans,\" Hughes said. \"Some people don't think it is the vice president. Some think it could be (Michigan Gov.) Gretchen Whitmer or (California Gov.) Gavin Newsom. All of these are conversations going on in the background. There are many ways this can go. We are still in a bit of a conundrum right now. But this is politics.\"\n\nKelly Green, a 1991 graduate of Howard, said she is supporting Harris, who she thinks is ably qualified to run for president.\n\nBut she is fearful that America might not be ready to embrace a woman, even one who could prevent former President Donald Trump -- whom Democrats have branded as a threat to democracy because of his positions on guns, abortion, immigration, taxes, education and trade -- from returning to the Oval Office.\n\n\"America is not ready to vote for a woman, let alone a Black woman,\" said Green, who lives in Marietta. \"We have been indoctrinated with too much self-hate into thinking that Black women can't do the job when over and over again, it has been shown that Black women carry this democratic process. I am ready for the fight and willing to do whatever I need to do, but I think it is going to be very hard. I am very scared.\"\n\nDuring the campaign season, Harris visited Atlanta five times, including twice in one week earlier this month. And with Georgia positioned as a prime battleground state, she is likely to return. That can't be soon enough for Elyce Strong Mann.\n\nLike millions of travelers this weekend, Mann was having a rough day Sunday trying to secure a flight home to Atlanta. When she finally landed and opened her phone to call her husband, she was greeted with a text message from him letting her know that Biden had dropped out and endorsed Harris.\n\n\"All I could say was hallelujah,\" said Mann, who teaches screenwriting at Emory University. \"I am excited because she is smart, capable and mentally sound. I think she can, and I think she will win. We are talking about the state of our democracy. It is more than politics now. People will rally behind her.\"\n\nMann, a 1993 graduate of Spelman College, is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., the oldest Black Greek letter sorority in the world with more than 360,000 initiated members in all 50 states and 11 nations.\n\nShondria Covington, who is also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha and the former president of the Greater Atlanta Chapter of Jack and Jill, said no sooner than a half hour after Biden's announcement an unofficial mobilization began.\n\n\"I am excited and proud of Soror Vice President and of Biden for being forward-thinking,\" Covington said. \"Us being part of an organization of over [360,000] Black women, this will become a movement. It is uniting us.\"\n\nCovington said that members of the sorority, through group chats and messages, have already started fundraising giving at least the symbolic amount of $19.08, signifying the date that the sorority was founded in 1908 at Howard University.\n\nHarris joined the sorority during her senior year at Howard University in the spring of 1986. She has remained committed to the sorority, whose political members have included Hazel O'Leary, Sharon Pratt and Sheila Jackson-Lee, throughout her professional and political career.\n\n\"The reach of the sorors of AKA is so expansive that it will go beyond the sorority and Black women and we will be able to touch all groups, races and genders to create a swirl for Soror Harris,\" Covington said. \"As a Black woman, this move signals the progression in this country that we need to see.\"\n\nStaff Reporter DeAsia Paige contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "capitalgazette.com",

Now that President Joe Biden has stepped down from the 2024 presidential race, Harris has become his top potential successor in what is already set to be a historic election.\n\nHarris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, has already garnered the endorsement of major political action committees and advocacy groups representing Asian, Pacific Islander, Black and Latino voters.\n\nEndorsements flood in\n\nIn a statement, the AAPI Victory Fund called Harris the \"best choice to win this November.\"\n\n\"We will fight with all of our might to make her the first South Asian and Black woman ever to serve as president of the United States,\" said Shekar Narasimhan, the fund's chairman and founder, and Joe Nguy\u1ec5n, president and CEO.\n\nThe Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA) told ABC News that Harris \"represents the epitome of resilience, leadership and historic achievement.\"\n\n\"Vice President Harris' journey mirrors the struggles and triumphs of countless women of color who have navigated systemic barriers to ascend to positions of influence,\" the statement continued. \"Her leadership and dedication to justice, equality and representation are aligned with BWOPA's mission to empower Black women and promote political engagement.\"\n\nLatino Victory Board Chairman Luis A. Miranda, Jr. called Biden's decision to step down \"selfless\" and said they \"previously endorsed Vice President Harris for VP, and we look forward to continue working closely with her to ensure Latino voices are reflected in government, and that our issues continue to be prioritized in the 2024 presidential campaign.\"\n\nWomen's groups also chimed in amid the wave of endorsements:\n\n\"In this historic moment for our country, we have the opportunity to not only elect a proven, qualified leader who is ready on Day One to fight for families and hold those in power accountable -- but also to elect the first-ever woman president,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund, in a statement.\n\nHarris' intersectionality\n\nHarris' mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, immigrated to the U.S. in 1958 for postgraduate studies at the age of 19 and married Jamaican immigrant Donald Harris six years later. Gopalan Harris raised the vice president and her sister herself following a divorce from Donald Harris in 1971.\n\n\"As many of you may know, my mother arrived in the United States from India when she was 19 years old, by herself, never having been to America. My mother had two goals in her life: to raise her two daughters -- my sister, Maya, and me -- and to end breast cancer,\" said Harris at an AAPI celebration in May. \"My mother never asked anyone's permission to pursue her dreams. And it is because of her character, strength and determination that within one generation I stand before you as vice president of the United States.\"\n\nHarris has long embraced the two sides of her heritage -- highlighted in her recollections of attending a historically Black university, weaving Hindu traditions into her wedding ceremony, joining both the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and Congressional Black Caucus, and more.\n\nStill, Harris has been criticized by some South Asian and Black voters who believe she has uplifted one identity more than the other. Others argue she has not advocated for her communities enough, in some cases saying they felt \"neglected.\"\n\nIn a 2020 op-ed written by Sadanand Dhume for the Wall Street Journal, the author accuses Harris of failing to highlight some details about where her family is from because of political conflicts.\n\n\"In her book, Ms. Harris airbrushes her mother's community from her story. The words Tamil and Brahmin don't appear at all. At one point the senator mentions that Gopalan won an award for her singing in India, but not that it was for Carnatic music, a classical art form closely associated with Tamil Brahmins,\" Dhume writes.\n\nWhen asked about critics who question the \"legitimacy\" of her Blackness in an interview on the Breakfast Club, Harris responded: \"If you walked on Hampton's campus or Howard's campus or Morehouse or Spelman or Fisk, you would have a much better appreciation for the diaspora, for the diversity, for the beauty in the diversity of who we are as Black people.\"\n\nIn 2020, Natalie Masuoka, Department of Asian American Studies chair at UCLA, argued that Harris' identity was going to shift the way Americans think about race and identity.\n\n\"Multiracial identification encourages us to think about how complex racial identity can be for many Americans,\" Masuoka said in her essay. \"This opens opportunities to have constructive conversations about how race impacts individual life chances.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAPI_Victory_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AAPI Victory Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Harris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald J.

The announcement comes after calls to step down from two-thirds of Democrats and former president Barack Obama questioning the viability of Biden's campaign. The calls for Biden to step down intensified after what many thought was a disastrous debate performance in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election.\n\nA quick perusal of reactions via social media will reveal a mix of both joy and fear. Many are bracing themselves for the anti-blackness and misogynoir that will accompany this bombshell announcement. If Harris becomes the Democratic nominee, she would make history as the first Black and Asian woman to lead the ticket for a major political party. Harris is not the first Black woman to run for president; in 1972, Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman to campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination but was unable to secure the nomination.\n\nAs part of the Biden administration, Harris has received backlash over the handling of the war in Gaza and the support and aid the United States has provided to Israel. There are also many valid critiques of Harris and her track record as San Francisco's district attorney. As district attorney, Harris implemented an anti-truancy program that passed in 2011. Under the program, parents are charged with a misdemeanor if their kids miss 10% of a school year without providing a valid reason for the absence. The program may have disproportionately impacted children from underrepresented racial groups. One Black mother, Cheree Peoples, shared her story of being arrested under the program, for a misunderstanding regarding her daughter's absences from school due to sickle cell disease.\n\nAnother critique of Harris, who has earned the nickname 'Copala Harris', has been her complicated record as California's attorney general. During her time as attorney general, many have pointed to the fact that Harris failed to intervene in cases that involved killings by police officers. Another criticism of Harris centers on the fact that during her time as attorney general, Harris's office fought to keep low-risk, nonviolent prisoners in prison. During her time as district attorney, more than 1,900 people were convicted for marijuana-related offenses, though most of those convicted were not sent to prison.\n\nDespite some understandable apprehensions about Harris and her record, because we live in a white supremacist society, Harris' race and gender, and not her policies, will have a huge impact on the public discourse, affecting perceptions of her, her qualifications, and whether she is a viable candidate for the presidency. It's important to note that Harris is following a long tradition of Black women stepping into leadership roles during times of crisis. The glass cliff is the phenomenon where women elevate to the top levels of leadership only during times of crisis and turmoil. Black women, in particular, are often asked to step into leadership roles to help clean up messes they did not create, and often experience heightened scrutiny in the process. Black women have a reputation as being the superheroes and saviors of democracy.\n\nHarris's journey over the next few months will be triggering to many who have experienced the glass cliff. Black women everywhere are bracing for the vitriol that will accompany this monumental announcement. We must recognize the role misogynoir will play in the discourse around Harris. By calling it out whenever it rears its ugly head, we can play a powerful role in disruption.\n\nIs America ready for a Black and Indian woman as president? This question has dominated the public conversation since Biden announced that he would be stepping down. A more significant question to ponder is whether Harris is a suitable candidate to lead this country and what specific evidence we have to support this.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType":

As I've said before, only President Joe Biden knew if he had four more years in him. He apparently felt he didn't and bowed out. It takes cojones to fight to the end, but it sometimes takes bigger cojones to know when not to fight.\n\nI'm about 70 percent sure that Vice President Kamala Harris will be the nominee following the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, sent in to do battle against the dragons Drogon, Rhagal and Viserion, or Donald Trump, J.D. Vance and Peter Theil, as it were.\n\nIf she's confirmed, it's a foregone conclusion that anyone who doesn't want to see Trump return should vote for her heavily, but we also know that the Black vote would be again what puts her over the top. However, there is a warning that Democrats should understand clearly: overlook Harris for the nomination and you can forget about any formidable Black voting bloc until possibly 2036.\n\nA process must still take place to officially nominate Harris, and although many Democrats are jumping behind her, she has not garnered the endorsement of some powerful names in the party including Sen. Chuck Schumer, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and most noticeably.former president Barack Obama, who so far endorsed an open nominating process.\n\nBut it's safe to say that Obama moves different: In 2020, he waited until the primaries were all but wrapped up before he endorsed Biden.\n\nThe reality now, though, is that a very strong candidate is already at the table who can bring home the election with built-in support. But things may not always be this way. Demographics are shifting in this country, as they always are. That's also true for Black people. Democrats don't know how they will look in another four or eight years if they lose the Black vote this time.\n\nIt's certainly possible that Black voters stay with liberal or progressive candidates in 2028, but let's say Trump wins and the GOP sees just how catastrophically far to the right he has driven the party and it decides to flow more to the center. That could attract some Black voters who may want options by that time.\n\nAlso, the Baby Boomer generation is aging and some will begin to pass away, while their grandchildren, Gen Z, will come of age. Already cynical about politics, the Democrats may not be able to sway them the way they have in years past.\n\nThis is particularly true if there are future issues that no politician is seeing right now like regional war around the globe, runaway inflation, dependent technology fails, climate change-spurred weather disasters, and mass mental illness issues in adults caused by overuse of social media as children.\n\nBlack people have been voting reliably for the Democratic party for the past several election cycles with 87 percent in 2020; 89 percent in 2016; 93 percent in 2012; and 95 percent in 2008. Many people have complained that the Democrats take the Black vote for granted. But there's no question that in local, state, and federal elections, we made the difference for so many politicians.\n\nIn a scenario in which the Democrats are not in office and autocratic far right policies are implemented, future young voters could be apathetic. It would be harder for Democrats to make a case to people who at that point would be just trying to survive. Think of a 2030s in which more federal prisons abuilt because a poor economy causes rampant crime, and women are criminalized for seeking basic healthcare.\n\nIf that happens, where will the Dems get their Black votes from? The Republicans would have no worries about major challenges probably until the 2036 cycle.\n\nWith all this said, the Democrats still need to show Black folks what's in it for us. We still need federal law speaking to justice in policing, we still need college loan forgiveness, we still need to deal with gun violence, the homeownership gap, and inflation or find themselves in the same situation they were just days ago.\n\nRight now we can see the forest and the trees. The foreseeable future stretches up to later this decade and we know that keeping the Black vote in one place will mean having a candidate we are willing to get behind. Democrats ignore this at their peril.\n\n-- -- -- -- -- --", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madison_j_gray@theroot.com", "name": "Madison J.

There's no guarantee yet that she will actually be the candidate. But in 24 hours she raised $81 million and secured enough delegates to win the party's nomination -- not a bad day's work.\n\nThere is, of course, some worried hand-wringing. Most of the worries boil down to \"the last time we ran a woman, she lost.\" This is true -- but it also treats one woman as a stand-in for all women, and derives a sweeping lesson from a single race.\n\nIt seems worth mentioning that a white man has lost in every single other election in American history, including two times to a Black man. Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton in 2016, and again to Joe Biden in 2020. We have not extrapolated out from that long history of losses that white men can't win. We shouldn't do the same based on the one election in which a woman was a major party's nominee.\n\nHarris also offers several unique strengths, particularly vis a vis Donald Trump. There is first -- and most obviously -- the fact that Trump has spent years attacking Biden for his age and cognitive abilities, suggesting that an old man shouldn't be running the country. That was always a risky move for a candidate who is only three years Biden's junior, and who will himself be in his 80s, and the oldest president ever, if he wins and serves a full term. But now it looks like an especially boneheaded strategy.\n\nThe GOP was remarkably successful at making Biden's age an issue, and after the disastrous Trump/Biden debate earlier this summer, the entire country has spent the last month talking about how old is too old to sit in the Oval Office, and expressing concerns about the prospect of a very old man leading the nation. Well, Trump is now that very old man. He is a man who is not particularly articulate, and who often fumbles his words and mixes up people, places, and things. Voters have been primed -- by him -- to be very concerned about age and cognitive function. It was only in contrast to the subdued Biden that he seemed vigorous. Now he is almost surely facing off against a candidate who is two decades younger, appears significantly healthier, and comes across as much more intellectually adept -- advantages that will hold true whether the ultimate candidate is Harris or some other, possibly even younger Democrat.\n\nIn MAGA World, Trump Is Now the Ultimate Survivor -- and Male Savior\n\nHarris is also a former prosecutor, a fact that hurt her with the left in the 2020 Democratic primary when protests against police violence were raging and criminal justice reform was a bipartisan issue, but which looks very different in 2024. The Trump campaign has made this election partly about crime and safety. If the match-up is Harris versus Trump, then it's also the prosecutor versus the convicted felon. And the convicted felon oversaw a big jump in the murder rate while he was in office, while the former prosecutor saw murders go down during her time as vice president.\n\nAs a prosecutor, Harris' record is unlikely to please the authoritarian right or the prison-abolitionist left, and she certainly made some missteps, but it's the kind of reasonably tough-on-crime agenda that average voters might find largely unobjectionable: Opposed to the death penalty but cracking down on gun and violent crimes; diverting first-time non-violent offenders away from prison and into job training and educational programs; telling parents of serially truant students that they could face jail time if they didn't get their kids in school. As a senator, she worked on bipartisan criminal justice reform initiatives.\n\nAs Harris put it during a campaign stop in Delaware on Monday, \"I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type.\" And, she said, \"I will proudly put my record against his.\"\n\nTo detractors and skeptics, Harris's biggest vulnerability is her identity: she's a woman, and a multi-racial one at that. America has had nearly two and a half centuries of unbroken male rule, and that rule has also been entirely white for every single one of those years except eight -- and the lone Black man to ever hold the office was indisputably a unique political talent. Hillary Clinton was one of the most qualified candidates to ever run for the presidency, and she ran against a thoroughly unqualified boor of a man and lost anyway -- in part because Trump attracted legions of voters motivated by sexism and thrilled with his misogyny.\n\nBut the peculiarities of an election eight years ago are not identical to the ones at play now. To many voters (including this one), a Clinton win felt inevitable, not urgent. This time around, no one is under the impression that Trump can't win. And because the history-making quality of the potential first female president doesn't feel at all preordained but rather like a difficult but in-reach goal, we very well may see many more people willing to work hard and turn out to make it happen.\n\nAmerica in 2024 is not America in 2016, psychologically or demographically. Young voters who were not eligible to cast ballots in 2016 are the most racially diverse in U.S. history. And the fastest-growing racial group in the U.S.? Multi-racial Americans, of which Harris is one: her mother was Indian and her father is Black. This is not to say that multi-racial voters are going to automatically cast their ballots for Harris. It is to say that in a nation where one in ten people now identify as multi-racial -- and where nearly 1 in 5 are Latino, and more than 1 in 10 are Black -- a Trumpian strategy that depends on racial animus and resentment is a risky bet, not just for the legions of non-white voters, but also for a white American public whose partners, children, grandchildren, neighbors, friends, and loved ones are less likely than ever to be white. Harris' very existence may indeed push racially-resentful voters further toward Trump. But she may also trigger Trump's own racial animus, and that very well may turn off even many conservatives.\n\nNor is Harris blazing a wholly uncharted path. Black women have ascended to positions of power across the U.S., especially in the Democratic Party, where Black women are also the most reliable voting bloc. Black women are, like women more broadly, underrepresented in the halls of power, and particularly in executive roles (no state has ever elected a Black female governor). But Black female executives are far from nonexistent. Black women are mayors of major American cities from Los Angeles to Philadelphia to New Orleans to Washington, D.C. Electing a Black woman president would be huge and historic -- and far from impossible.\n\nHarris has also been stronger than Biden on Democrats' winningest issue: Abortion rights. Everywhere abortion has been on the ballot, abortion has won. Trump has already wisely identified abortion as a losing issue for his campaign and is trying to just not talk about it, while Biden was uniquely bad at talking about it. Trump is responsible for overturning Roe v. Wade and making this whole mess, and picked a vice president who wants a national abortion ban with few exceptions and who dismissed pregnancy from rape as a mere inconvenience. Biden famously avoided saying the word \"abortion\" at all, and in his debate with Trump turned what should have been a home-run abortion question into a bizarre ramble about women being raped by their in-laws and immigrants killing white girls. Unlike either of these men, Harris has a solid pro-choice record, and the ability to speak cogently and urgently about reproductive rights.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Harris has momentum behind her. For better or worse, Trump reshaped American politics into something between spectator sport and reality TV. Democratic voters tend to be much more circumspect and rational than Republican ones, showing with their ballots that they prefer competence to drama. But the Biden campaign felt like a collective slog toward inevitable defeat; the primary emotions he invoked were pity and dread.\n\nBiden dropping out and endorsing Harris was not only the biggest news story in the nation, but she immediately racked-up endorsements and donations. And sure, a small handful of donors acted a little salty about a candidate who doesn't look like them, or like most of the candidates who came before. But Harris largely has the wind at her back.\n\nThere are a lot of words that may come to mind when one thinks of Donald Trump, but \"new\" is not one of them. Harris is not a new kid on the political block, but she has never had the national profile of Biden or Trump, and has been newly propelled to the top of the Democratic candidate pool. She sits at the fortunate intersection of inspiration (a potential first), anger (over anti-abortion laws), novelty, and hope. No amount of campaign spending can buy that kind of emotional resonance. And if she can keep hitting all of these bright notes as she faces off against a sour old man, she can be the person who finally tosses Trump into the trash heap of history, and makes clear that his MAGA movement has fully expired.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

The presidential bid could make Ms Harris the first woman president of the United States.\n\nMs Harris today expressed her gratitude for the \"overwhelming support\" and reaffirmed her commitment to the Democratic presidential nomination, just two days after President Joe Biden, who was seeking re-election, announced his decision to step aside. \"When I announced my campaign for President, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination. Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee, and as a daughter of California, I am proud that my home state's delegation helped put our campaign over the top. I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon,\" she said in a statement.\n\nJotaka Eaddy, founder of 'Win With Black Women', which describes itself as a collective of intergenerational, intersectional Black women leaders, said, \"Anybody that does not think that Black and Brown women are the backbone of this party (Democratic), they don't know us.\"\n\nBlack women are a key Democratic voting bloc. The call, which attracted several celebrities and political figures, was conducted off the record, with participants speaking in their personal capacities. Attendees described it as feeling like church or a family reunion.\n\nMs Eaddy has been organising such calls since August 2020. Her organisation aims to elect Black women nationwide and speaks out against racism and sexism. During the 2020 election, the most attendees she had on one Zoom call was 1,500 people but Sunday's call saw more than 40,000 attending.\n\nBut the large volume of people posed its own challenges for Zoom. The video communications platform has a 1,000-person capacity. When that limit was reached, members of Ms Eaddy's organisation contacted Zoom which upgraded the group to a webinar format, allowing unlimited attendees. \"I am forever grateful to the leadership of Zoom for what they did,\" Ms Eaddy said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"What happened last night was historic,\" Ms Eaddy added. \"It really is the culmination of so many Black women for years and years and years that have been working, cultivating and creating for this moment.

The Zoom will be hosted by Roland Martin and the Black Star Network and feature Khalil Thompson, executive director of 'Win With Black Men\": Bakari Sellers, CNN commentator; Michael Blake, CEO of Kairos Democracy; and Quentin James, president collective pac.\n\n\"Women really rallied around our vice president to give support for her and we're hoping we can match it with tonight's call,\" Thompson told ADW in an exclusive interview. \"I know Roland Martin, Michael Blake, Quinton James and Bakari Sellers and others are really joining in to make this call special tonight. We welcome more Black men to come to this table. And today we want to make sure we're bringing out as many Black men to participate in this process. We not only want you to vote for president, but we want you to vote for a Senator, Congress, for state's attorney for your mayor, your judges that are on the ballot. We want you to really get engaged in your communities.\"\n\nThe narrative presented by some mainstream media outlets is that Black men are disengaged with this year's political process. Thompson wants to debunk that theory.\n\n\"I think we have to support our communities and our brothers who are frustrated,\" Thompson said. \"But there is not one person that has been elected to office that's a perfect human being, because none of us are. And so making sure that there's not a litmus test or a purity test that we're going to hold one particular party to and not hold the other to. I think that is a detriment to us all. It is important that I believe we show up and support Kamala Harris. I think when we make it about one particular person, then each election is just about that person.

As Delaware quickly moves toward becoming a majority-minority state, local groups see Harris, the first woman, first Black American and first South Asian American vice president as having the potential to represent people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nHarris, a former U.S. senator from California and the state's attorney general, is the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father. The 59-year-old Oakland native lived with her mother in Montreal, Canada, before attending Howard University, an HBCU in Washington, D.C. During her senior year, she became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. The organization was established in 1908 by 16 Black female students attending the university. The group has since grown to 300,000 members in more than 1,200 undergraduate and graduate chapters worldwide.\n\nThe sorority does not endorse political candidates. However, it supports members' running and holding public office.\n\nAs keynote speaker at the organization's annual convention on July 10, the vice president urged the 20,000 members in attendance to turn out at the polls. After declaring her intention to secure the Democratic nomination, the group along with other Black sororities and fraternities have rallied to support her.\n\nLocally, individual members are expressing support for Harris, including fellow AKA sorority member Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester. In a statement on Biden's decision to withdraw from the presidential race, Blunt Rochester declared, \"There is no better person or leader more equipped to do so than Vice President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nSupport from the sorority, and Black women in general, is significant. Nationally, Democrats have historically relied on Black women as key allies, as they have been a loyal voting bloc with increasing political influence. Black women have been credited with helping boost Black voter turnout in recent elections, including 2018 and the 2020 contest that Biden won.\n\nNATIONAL SUPPORT: With Biden out, will Delaware Democratic Party support VP Kamala Harris?\n\nHarris's background appeals to diverse communities\n\nOther local groups also see Harris as a part of a community striving for success for themselves and their families.\n\nAsian Americans make up 11% of Delaware's population, with Asian Indians being the largest ethnic group among them. Palash Gupta, chair of the Delaware Commission on Indian Heritage and Culture and the Delaware Asian American Business Association, acknowledges Harris's potential as the party's nominee as a \"proud moment for Asian Americans, especially [for someone who has] roots in India.\"\n\nWhile Gupta said Harris reflects the Asian Indian community as a productive member of America's immigrant story rather than a political party representative, Asian Americans in The First State are becoming increasingly engaged in politics. From 2010 to 2020, the number of eligible AAPI voters in Delaware grew by 42%. Last June, Gupta attended a state dinner hosted by Biden and attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.\n\nHarris's background may galvanize these groups as in past elections. Besides increased Black voter turnout mobilized by Black women, previous elections have shown notable increases from diverse populations. From 2016 to 2020, turnout among Asian American, Latino or Hispanic and non-college white voters each grew by 6 points or more. Additionally, younger progressive voters, whose turnout was crucial in previous elections, may come out to support Harris as many believe she embodies much of what the future looks like.", "source":

They're also concerned", "body": "Christine Edwards pulled her car over when she first learned President Joe Biden abandoned his 2024 reelection bid Sunday.\n\n\"I didn't believe it at first,\" said Edwards, who read Biden's announcement on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"I had to get to a place where I was safe to actually look at my phone and read the announcement. And I was pretty shocked.\"\n\nEdwards is a Charlotte native and the founder of Civility Localized, a consulting firm that works with local governments to increase community engagement.\n\nShe's excited for Kamala Harris to likely be the new Democratic nominee; Harris already secured the support of enough delegates to get the nomination at the Democratic National Convention next month. But Edwards has some concerns.\n\n\"I was pretty fearful because of the state of our country,\" Edwards said. \"There's this phenomenon of Black women being brought in to fix things when they've gone horribly wrong, rather than people just believing in us and hiring us and electing us in the first place. I think there's a lot of deep-seated misogyny and racism in this country.\"\n\nStill, she felt a palpable, newfound excitement.\n\n\"I think we're feeling this new shift toward positive energy, and it almost feels like 2008,\" said Edwards, who was in college during the 2008 presidential election. \"It feels like that same kind of energy.\"\n\nThe Charlotte Observer spoke with local Black female voters ranging from elected officials to small business owners about Kamala Harris as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nSeveral described a similar ambivalence: hope mingled with fear.\n\n\"I do have some safety concerns,\" said Charlotte Councilwoman Tiawana Brown. \"There was an attempted assassination on Donald Trump. We have a history of assassinations and assassination attempts on presidents, but then a Black woman being in that position will really be very scary for a lot of us.\"\n\nStill, Brown is excited at the possibility of making history.\n\n\"First, she's the first African-American vice president, but now she could also be the first woman to be president, particularly as a Black woman,\" she said. \"It made me think about what it could do for women in general in elevating our role.\"\n\nHarris fundraising helped quell fears\n\nHarris raised $81 million within the first 24 hours after Biden announced his endorsement for her as the Democratic nominee, the largest 24-hour sum reported by either side in the 2024 presidential race. By Tuesday, that total reached $100 million.\n\nShe also secured the backing of more than 1,976 delegates in the first round of voting, The Associated Press reported late Monday, effectively clinching the nomination.\n\nEdwards said the fundraising numbers quelled her fears about whether Americans would support Harris.\n\n\"Trump has a lot of Silicon Valley billionaires backing him, so being able to get those donations and be aligned with people that have deep pockets, especially right now, is so important,\" she said.\n\nEdwards joined a Zoom call Sunday night organized by WinWithBlackWomen, a coalition of Black women leaders and organizers around the country. Nearly 44,000 other people joined the call, which raised $1.5 million for Harris in three hours.\n\n\"It made me feel a lot more energized,\" Edwards said. \"Just knowing that Black women are organizing, it gives me a lot of hope for these next 100 days.\"\n\nCorine Mack, president of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg chapter of the NAACP, says she was already planning on voting in this election, but she's feeling reinvigorated.\n\n\"The fact that we have the opportunity to have an African-American, Asian-American woman running for president is a wonderful feeling because we can see ourselves through her,\" Mack said. \"Our young girls will feel like they, too, can strive to be whatever they want to be when they look at her.\"\n\nWhat matters to voters\n\nThe women shared a number of diverse issues that matter most to them this election, from reproductive rights to climate change to access to education. More than that, though, they say voters are sick of politicians prizing partisanship above people.\n\n\"People want leaders who are more concerned about people than politics. That goes for national and local leaders,\" said Alesha Brown, a civil rights attorney and executive director of local nonprofit For the Struggle.\n\n\"There's this deep party allegiance going on within Congress and state legislatures and even the Supreme Court, which is supposed to be a neutral institution. We want to see leaders who are actually representing our best interests.\"\n\nCouncilwoman Brown said she'd heard the same from her District 3 constituents.\n\n\"What people want is for us to get into office and not forget them,\" she said. \"People want a person who is going to do exactly what they tell us they're going to do. People want someone who will be truthful when they're out on the campaign trail.\"\n\nTerese Hutchinson is the owner of The Dooby Shop, a cosmetology school with an enrollment of 20 students on Beatties Ford Road. Hutchinson has been in the community for nearly two decades.\n\nShe is optimistic about the opportunity of having a Black woman on the November ballot for president.\n\n\"This is a huge stride in progression towards equal opportunity for all,\" Hutchinson said in an email to The Charlotte Observer.\n\nAmong the things concerning her is the direction of the election -- whether the Democratic Party has enough time to \"properly prepare\" to run with another candidate and how small business owners will be affected.\n\nShe is not convinced that she and other small businesses run by Black women would have the same grant opportunities if Donald Trump wins the election.\n\n\"The economic development for small business owners (are) being overlooked is my concern with (President Joe) Biden dropping out,\" she said in her email.\n\nGet out the vote\n\nCouncilwoman Brown is confident women, and Black women in particular, will mobilize in November.\n\n\"Black women have always carried the vote. We always are at the polls,\" she said. \"We have the ability to organize, mobilize and make things happen, so do not take the woman vote for granted, particularly the Black vote.\"\n\nShe cited Harris's membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, one of nine historically Black sororities and fraternities in the National Pan-Hellenic Council, known as \"the Divine Nine,\" as potentially drawing more voters to her corner.\n\n\"There's going to be a ripple effect with all of the Divine Nine,\" said Brown.\n\nPresidents of each of the Divine Nine announced a coordinated voter mobilization campaign Monday.\n\n\"This campaign will activate the thousands of chapters and members in our respective organizations to ensure strong voter turnout,\" the organization said in a news release.\n\nEdwards says it will come down to everyday people deciding to cast a ballot.\n\n\"A lot of times, people get disenfranchised or feel like they don't have to participate because someone else will do it for them,\" she said. \"But we've seen how these elections can come down to a few votes.\"", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte

The event's organiser, Jotaka Eaddy, was described by Forbes as the \"Olivia Pope of Silicon Valley.\"\n\nOn Sunday, organiser and strategist Eaddy, founder of the #WinWithBlackWomen network, hosted the Zoom call for Black women. According to Bloomberg, the event attracted 44,000 participants and raised over $1.5 million for Kamala Harris' newly launched presidential campaign.\n\nRepresentative Maxine Waters of California, one of the highest-ranking Black women in Congress, also spoke at the event. Additionally, lawmakers Joyce Beatty and Jasmine Crockett spoke about their commitment to supporting Harris in the upcoming presidential election against Donald Trump this November.\n\nReverend Bernice King, daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and CEO of The King Center, stated that although she has been voting since she was 18, she had never publicly endorsed a candidate until now.\n\n\"I'm 100% in her corner,\" King said on the call. \"I'm going to be very strategic in the way that I move forward.\" Win With Black Women, the political advocacy group that organised the call, later reported raising $1.5 million for Harris' election campaign in three hours.\n\nThis contribution was part of a surge in donations, as Democrats collected over $50 million online on Sunday following President Joe Biden's announcement that he would not seek reelection. Trump's campaign could face new challenges after Biden stepped aside and began endorsing Harris.\n\nPolls indicated that Black voters, who had strongly supported Biden in the 2020 election, were shifting away from the Democratic Party due to concerns about inflation, slow progress on civil rights, and the president's stance on Israel in the Gaza conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has been sparing no effort to gain support from Black voters. For LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, Harris embodies exactly what the Democrats needed. Brown observed that while Biden failed to ignite voter enthusiasm, Harris changed that dynamic.\n\nBrown committed to actively campaigning for Harris, emphasising that Harris is her preferred candidate. \"We needed a shot in the arm, something to activate us,\" Brown said in an interview. \"I'm now both excited and ignited.\"\n\nThe call also featured former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, and Maryland's First Lady Dawn Moore. Additionally, Maryland Governor Wes Moore later released a statement endorsing Harris' candidacy.\n\nRepresentative Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, encouraged attendees to leverage their platforms to generate support for Harris within their communities. \"We come with a strong message because we're in the fight, we're on this journey, we realise the magnitude of this moment,\" she said.\n\nAccording to #WinWithBlackWomen's Instagram update, donations exceeded $1.5 million in just three hours. Attendance reached a peak of 44,000 members, as reported in another Instagram post.\n\nThe overwhelming attendance for the call required organisers to request an extension of Zoom Video Communications Inc.'s capacity limit, which the company was able to accommodate. In a post on X, Eaddy expressed her gratitude to Zoom COO Aparna Bawa for helping \"create the space for history.\"\n\nA marketing manager who participated in the call noted on X that Bawa intervened to ensure the platform could accommodate tens of thousands of attendees. Representatives from Zoom had not yet responded to Business Insider's request for comment on Bawa's role in the event.\n\nWith President Joe Biden succumbing to pressure and stepping back from the 2024 race, Harris represents the Democrats' strongest chance to thwart Donald Trump's return.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times UK"},

As a political writer, Burris has had bylines at CNN, Salon.com, BNR, and AlterNet and serves as a senior digital editor for RawStory.com.\n\nBlack pundits and columnists are already predicting the racism that will surface from some of the top media outlets in the country as they try to cover a candidate of color in the presidential race.\n\nWriting for \"The Nation,\" legal expert Elie Mystal shredded the New York Times for a report they titled: \"Some Black Voters Say They Wonder if a Black Woman Can Win.\"\n\nMystal was furious as the Times \"used other Black people to make their point.\"\n\nRead Also: The prosecutor vs. the felon\n\nHe explained that as a Black voter, he wonders about many things.\n\n\"I wonder if aliens exist; I wonder if God is an a--hole; I wonder how many abortions Donald Trump has paid for,\" Mystal wrote Tuesday. \"But the Times wouldn't run a story that stated 'Some Black Voters Say They Wonder How Many Active Ku Klux Klan Members Attended the Republican National Convention.'\"\n\nHe thinks that more Black voters likely wonder about the latter than about whether Harris could win in November.\n\nOne Black woman from Atlanta, interviewed by the Times, said, \"America is just not ready for a woman president, especially not a Black woman president.\"\n\nKeli Goff at The Daily Beast is another writer parroting that language, he said. Her sentiment is akin to, \"I'd vote for a Black woman, but not that Black woman.\"\n\nMystal wrote that Goff simply stating what the U.S. has told Black people for generations, especially Black women. That message: \"America hates you.\"\n\n\"We see the disdain this country holds for people of color whenever we turn on the news. We feel the antipathy this country holds for women every time we go to work, or read an opinion from the Supreme Court,\" Mystal wrote.\n\n\"Harris has been subjected to the worst press coverage of any vice president in my lifetime, and she's about to be subjected to the worst coverage of any presidential candidate in American history... save perhaps Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nHe called it nothing more than \"white male supremacy,\" which not only dictates the leadership, but works to hold others down by telling them that they feel don't deserve power.\n\n\"I can already see David Brooks and Bret Stephens clacking away on their keyboards, doing everything in their power to call Harris unqualified, unintelligent, and undeserving of the office she seeks,\" Mystal wrote.\n\nThe Washington Post editorial board has already taken a different path by encouraging Harris not to hold back out of prudence.\n\nHe warned it will get \"ugly,\" but said he won't be deterred by \"programming that's

The Opportunity Zones Donald Trump heralded during his presidency? The former president depicted the tax break program for rich investors as a boon for Black America. Levine calls them a \"tax scam.\" From defunding public housing to promoting corporate subsidies, the policies put into place by both parties have empowered multinational companies to drain public coffers and shut off the faucets.\n\nLevine has been studying racial and economic inequality in the state since the 1990s, and he's only seen local elected officials treat it like the crisis it is in the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests. Even then, there were more lofty promises than actual outcomes. No amount of rhetoric can formidably challenge the tide of economic depression that has made Milwaukee an \"archetype\" of \"racial apartheid and inequality,\" as Levine put it in an exhaustive 2020 report.\n\nTo siphon off Black voters disenchanted with the status quo, Republicans have started to resort to the kind of half-baked, hypocritical cultural appeals for which they have long derided Democrats. The Republican Party of Milwaukee County's field office sits across the street from a beauty supply store and on the same block as two Black barbershops in the city's historically Black Bronzeville neighborhood, and it displays posters geared towards Blacks and Latinos.\n\nIn a June fireside chat aimed at Black Milwaukeeans (but consisting mostly of white attendees), US Senator Ron Johnson hopped on the criminal justice reform train, referencing the \"unfairness\" of Trump's felony case, after having campaigned as a law-and-order candidate in the 2022 midterms. \"My guess is that in the Black community, there's all kinds of situations where you believe the prosecutors using discretion had not been fair,\" Johnson told the audience. After lambasting \"identity politics\" and \"wokeness\" in recent election cycles, Republicans like him have clumsily tried to wield both in their latest play for Black voters.\n\nTrump's personality may well win over some Black Milwaukeeans who feel they have run out of options -- perhaps more than ever in recent history, given that Black support of the Democratic Party is at a historic low. But the Grand Ole Party's policies will likely prevent Black voters from ever flipping to Republicans en masse.\n\nJonathan Jarmon, executive director of Power to the Polls Federal Fund, a political action committee, believes that educating Black Milwaukeeans about the threat of a second Trump administration -- as outlined, for example, in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 document -- will be the best way to improve turnout. \"People are worried about a complete Republican takeover,\" Jarmon said, with Trump and the Republican Party \"doing more things to strip away rights for everyday people to benefit the wealthiest people in this country.\"\n\nAhead of his arrival in Milwaukee for the RNC, Trump reportedly called the city \"horrible\" -- neglecting to mention that his own party, which controls Wisconsin's state legislature, has made it inhospitable for many of its residents. With Republican policies in place -- from blocking minimum wage increases to union busting to voter suppression laws that keep business-friendly Republicans in power -- Wisconsin has frequently been called the worst state for Black Americans.\n\nCedonia, 38, makes her living doing gig work, delivering for Doordash and styling hair. When she was growing up, her mom drove a school bus, but her dad got sick at a young age and wasn't steadily employed. \"Living in Milwaukee, it's rough,\" she told me. The last time she voted was for Barack Obama. When Trump and Biden faced off in 2020, she couldn't muster a vote for either of them. \"I didn't like them. I felt like they were racist. I felt like certain stuff they was doing wasn't going to change anything.\" For her, the Black community needs a lot of changes. \"There's not enough housing. I don't think there's enough shelters for the homeless.\"\n\nShe doesn't plan to vote this year either. Reflecting on the Biden-Harris administration, she expresses concern about its defense spending overseas. \"They want to go to war with these other countries, they're giving them a whole lot of money. What are you doing for people in the US?\" As Vice President Harris attempts to align herself with Biden's domestic successes, she will also have to accept his foreign policy failures, including the virtual blank check he wrote to Israel in a relentless bombardment of Gaza that has killed thousands of Palestinians.\n\nCedonia and Wade are among the alarming number of Black Milwaukeeans who have become \"slide voters.\" Their effect on presidential elections isn't in moving the needle toward one or the other party, but in lowering turnout.\n\nIn 2016, Wisconsin saw the lowest Black voter turnout for a presidential election in the state's recorded history, nosediving from 79 percent in 2012 to 47 percent, per census data. As unprecedented as that drop had been, Black voter turnout in 2020 was even lower: Only 44 percent of the Black Wisconsin electorate showed up at the polls. For all the rhetoric about Black voters about saving democracy, many seem to feel there isn't much to save. When wages are meager, rents are unsustainable, and affordable homeownership is practically impossible, \"democracy\" feels more like an abstract concept than a meaningful rallying call.\n\nPresidential campaigns often emphasize \"bread and butter\" policies that are meant to appeal to the working class in coveted Midwest states. But working-class Black Milwaukeeans could use some brick and mortar. The heavy industry that once proliferated in the city has crumbled, just like the potholed roads running through Black neighborhoods.\n\nIn an election year, Biden was sure to erect signs at some of the city's many road construction sites crediting his success. \"Project Funded By President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law,\" the signs read. But energizing an eroded Black electorate that has been left to suffer through decades of abandonment will continue to be a work in progress. Celebrating a historical first in the form of Kamala Harris may work for some Black voters, but it might not be enough for a crucial number of Milwaukee residents who feel that their priorities always come last.\n\n\"It's two devils,\" a resident of Parkview Apartments in Milwaukee's northwest side told me. \"And I know a lot of people who feel the same way.\" It was a hot July afternoon, a few days before the Republican National Convention, and canvassers from the group Power to the Polls were out hoping to mobilize Black voters for the coming presidential election. The arduous work of engaging potential voters door-to-door \"in rain, sleet, or snow,\" as one canvasser put it, began in October, when President Joe Biden and Donald Trump were the obvious front-runners. But even with Biden stepping down from the race Sunday and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris, who could potentially become America's first Black and Asian woman president, the group has a rough road ahead as November looms closer.\n\nIn recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have been vying for the attention of Wisconsin's Black residents, who are largely concentrated in Milwaukee, the most populous city in this critical swing state The Democratic Party chose the city as their convention host in 2020, with Republicans following suit this year. Today, Harris is expected to be in Milwaukee for what could now be her first official campaign stop as she vies for the presidency, with Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes up for grabs. But the frenzy of outreach from party leaders to lure voters who have been disenfranchised for generations is like trying to sweep water out of the Titanic.\n\nAmid deindustrialization and especially after the 2008 financial meltdown, Black Milwaukeeans have been drowning in an economic crisis unlike almost anywhere else in the country. Study after study has shown that the city has ranked among the bottom on almost every economic and social metric -- from employment to education to median income -- for Black residents. Wisconsin as a whole hasn't fared much better. It's been a fact that was largely ignored until it became less politically expedient to do so.\n\nUntil recently, party leaders had been so focused on wooing coveted white swing voters -- some of whom voted for Obama and then flipped to Trump in 2016 -- that they lost sight of a quieter group who are often younger, more left-leaning, and more diverse. I call them slide voters: they aren't swinging between Republicans and Democrats, they're dropping out of politics altogether.\n\nSince May, I've surveyed dozens of Milwaukee residents about how they plan to vote in November, and whether they would vote at all. More than a third hadn't voted in the last two presidential elections. Some are open to voting this year but weren't sold on either Biden or Trump. Many may never come around -- even with a new nominee.\n\nWade, 33, was born in Milwaukee and raised in the city's south side. He periodically works for his uncle as a roofer to make ends meet. \"Who can I really vote for?\" he asked. \"I want there to be a better world. I want it to be like how I was growing up.\" Wade reminisced about a childhood he said was free of the kind of violence -- both from police and among residents -- that he's seen plaguing the city since his mid-twenties.\n\nWade is also finding steady employment difficult -- he's been registered with a temporary staffing agency, but the work has been inconsistent. \"I've been trying to get a job for damn near two years now,\" he said. \"I can't win for losing.\"\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has been touting record low unemployment rates for Black Americans as part of their campaign messaging, a statistic that should resonate for Milwaukeeans. But according to Marc Levine, a researcher and Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, unemployment statistics are a flawed measure. Those rates don't include a key group: people who have been out of the work force for so long that they're not counted in federal employment data.\n\n\"The unemployment rate only calculates people who are in the labor force and looking for work,\" Levine told The Nation. \"If somebody is out of the labor force, they're not working, and they're just discouraged. They're not showing up at the unemployment office every day to register and find a job. For African American males with such a long period of chronic joblessness, and with the great difficulty of finding employment in Milwaukee, over time this group has simply fallen out of the labor force.\"\n\nEven when jobs are secured, adequate wages aren't guaranteed: of the country's 50 major metropolitan areas, Milwaukee has the lowest Black median income. The modest gains in employment under the Biden-Harris administration can't counter the weight of an economy that has crushed Black workers in the city since the 1970s and 80s, when heavy manufacturing began abandoning Milwaukee and other industrial centers.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Marc Veasey (D-Texas), didn't make his position known until Friday, two days before Biden announced his decision to leave the race.\n\nSeveral CBC members told HuffPost the reluctance to cast Biden adrift stemmed from two main factors: loyalty to a president they said had done right by them in his time in the White House and fear a free-for-all would erupt within the party if he was forced out.\n\n\"People did not want to judge Biden based on a 90-minute debate performance, because he has a history. His history has been very positive toward the Black agenda, and he has delivered,\" said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.).\n\n\"He was there for us, and we felt an obligation to be there for him,\" he said.\n\n\"He has made a difference for us in terms of showing us that he really did mean it when he said he was going to be a president for all people,\" said Rep. Al Green (D-Texas).\n\nGreen said he would be \"eternally grateful\" to Biden, ticking off Biden choosing Harris as his vice president, Ketanji Brown Jackson for the U.S. Supreme Court and Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be the ambassador to the United Nations as among his big accomplishments.\n\nBlack voters have been among Biden's strongest supporters since the 2020 primaries, and he owed a particular debt to one the CBC's most visible members, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), whose endorsement helped Biden win the 2020 primary in South Carolina and jumpstart his faltering campaign.\n\nBut the relationship was not always that way. One of the most dramatic moments in the 2020 Democratic primary season was, notably, when Harris challenged Biden over his opposition early in his career to forced busing as a racial integration measure.\n\n\"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public school. And she was bused to school every day,\" Harris said at a debate. \"That little girl was me.\"\n\nThe other worrisome question for Black lawmakers was uncertainty over what would happen if Biden stepped aside. While elected party members, party officials and grassroots party delegates to the national convention quickly signed on to Harris, it was not obvious that was going to happen before Biden stepped aside.\n\n\"If it's somebody else, and the people pushing Biden out did not appear to be supporting Kamala, if it's somebody else, then what happens at the convention?\" asked Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.).\n\n\"A lot of us have been around long enough to know you don't come out of a convention like that united,\" he said.\n\nCBC members brought up the ghosts of the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago that was notorious for police rioting against protesters and the 1972 convention. This year's convention will also be in Chicago.\n\n\"I remember what happened in '68. It was chaos. Although Hubert Humphrey got the nomination, Richard Nixon became president. I was concerned about that,\" Green said.\n\n\"We knew that a food fight convention would not be good. It would pit us against those who wanted another candidate,\" Johnson said. \"We were all in for Kamala Harris. An open primary call means we're not satisfied with Kamala Harris.\"\n\nHow Harris will ultimately play with both Black voters as a bloc and with voters in general in November is unclear, but the CBC members sounded optimistic.\n\n\"I always said if something, God forbid, was to ever happen to President Biden or if he should change his mind, [Harris] would be the rightful heir apparent. So it was no complexity or difficulty to shift our attention because the mission remains the same,\" said Rep. Shontel Brown (D-Ohio).\n\nJohnson said he wasn't worried about Harris' standing with Black voters.\n\n\"Forty-four thousand Black women got together Sunday night for a quick impromptu Zoom call,\" he said, a sign of the grassroots support she enjoys.\n\n\"She has a reservoir of support perhaps like exists on Mars, where you have to dig for it but you find it. I think it's there,\" he said.\n\nAs for concerns among some Black voters Harris may not play as well with the broader electorate as Biden did, Clyburn had his own answer when he appeared Sunday on CNN.\n\n\"You're never confident as to what voters will do under any set of circumstances,\" Clyburn said.\n\n\"I am confident of this as well: You never know until you get in the contest and you run the race.\"", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score":

Polls had shown Black voters, who overwhelmingly supported Biden during the 2020 election, had been moving away from the Democratic party following concerns about inflation, slow progress on civil-rights issues and the president's support for Israel in the war in Gaza. Trump, meanwhile, had sought to make gains with Black voters.\n\nFor LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, Harris is exactly what the Democrats needed. Biden had failed to get voters on the ground excited, but that's now changed, she said, adding she will now be campaigning for the vice president and making clear that Harris is her candidate of choice.\n\n'Excited and ignited'\n\n\"We needed a shot in the arm, something to activate us,\" Brown said in an interview. \"I'm now both excited and ignited.\"\n\nOthers on the call included former Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile, Washington, DC mayor Muriel Bowser and Maryland's First Lady Dawn Moore. Maryland governor Wes Moore later issued a statement supporting Harris' candidacy.\n\nRepresentative Beatty, a Democrat representing Ohio in Congress, urged attendees to use their platforms to rally support for Harris in their communities. \"We come with a strong message because we're in the fight, we're on this journey, we realise the magnitude of this moment,\" she said.", "source": {"uri":

Delegates, selected to represent their states or communities at their party's nominating convention and tasked with selecting the party's candidate for the November ballot, typically consist of early supporters, party activists, or political leaders, as reported by USA Today.\n\nFollowing President Joe Biden's endorsement of Harris after his withdrawal announcement, Democrats rallied behind the California native. According to an Associated Press survey, Harris, the first Black and South Asian Vice President, has garnered 2,688 delegates, significantly exceeding the 1,976 delegates needed for nomination, with 54 delegates still undecided.\n\nHarris is now the presumptive nominee, but her path to the presidency still demands diligent effort. Convention delegates retain the freedom to vote for their preferred candidate at the August convention or during a potential virtual roll call before the Democratic National Convention set to take place in Chicago.\n\nSupport for Kamala Harris is strong among all Black Democrats\n\nJust a few hours after Harris accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for president, NewsOne senior editor and author asha bandele joined an off-the-record private Zoom call for Black women led by the legendary Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, and Congresswoman and Joyce Beatty (D-Oh), and which featured Rep.Jasmine Crockett (D-Tx). The call, roughly two hours long, originally allotted for 1,000 guests grew exponentially, causing the organizers to open up platforms to accommodate all. The pride and excitement was palpable, bandele reported.\n\nSource: Scott Eisen / Getty\n\nFurther, she shared with NewsOne that \"Donna Brazile was masterful in explaining how Black women could help ensure the Vice President had the votes to secure the nomination, but the truly incredible thing was that because more than 1,000 women tried to get on, systems started crashing and in the end, it took likely an hour -- and a whole different platform to get us together,\" bandele said. \"But it was truly amazing to bear witness, in this age of impatience, how everyone stayed on, giving grace. It was like no one wanted to release the moment. By the end of the call, 1,000 people became 44,000 people.And of course, in under two days, the votes to ensure the Vice President's nomination were secured.\"\n\nPassion for the Vice President was also strong during a conference call held Monday night. In that gathering, the target audience was Black men. Hosted by Roland Martin, at least 35,000 Black men joined. Speakers included Gov. Wes Moore, Benjamin Crump, Mark Morial, and Derrick Johnson who leads the NAACP. They were deeply impactful in demonstrating how key every single vote was, and that there was no sitting this one out, bandele learned from one of the men who was present.

BLOC is among the countless outfits working on the ground to oppose Donald Trump and ensure a win for the Democratic Party in this year's elections.\n\nA day after the Republican National Convention ended in Milwaukee, Lang spoke to HT about the convention. But in a telling sign of the dilemmas confronting anti-Trump activists and Democratic Party sympathisers on the ground, especially in the Black community, she also spoke about Joe Biden and whether he should remain on the top of the ticket, explained why he has continued to enjoy the support of the Black community, how Blacks view Kamala Harris and her prospects as possibly the first Black woman to be the nominee of the party, and the politics of the next four months and beyond.\n\nThe RNC came to your town. How did you feel and what were your key takeaways from the convention?\n\nI was lucky enough to take my staff out of town. We are a Black political organisation that's outspoken. I had said we didn't want RNC here in 2022 and we had also been outspoken against law enforcement. Given the threats against black organising, we didn't feel safe. They told us that RNC would have a great economic impact, but even that didn't happen from what I gathered from local businesses.\n\nYou had folks like Marjorie Taylor Greene (a far-Right Republican Congresswoman) who went off on these homophobic rants. You had folks with signs that they were passing around talking about mass deportations. You had all of this very, very hateful rhetoric that does not align with Milwaukee or even Wisconsin's values. And when you have all of that political and racial rhetoric combined with what also happened on Saturday with the former president's assassination attempt and an increase of law enforcement -- there were multiple agencies from all across the country, both federal and statewide that were here -- it just felt like it was like a powder keg waiting to explode.\n\nSomething bad did happen and a law enforcement official from outside the state killed a man. And this was on the same night of the Republican theme of 'Keep America Safe Again'.\n\nTrump after the assassination bid\n\nWhat did you feel about Saturday's assassination bid and how do you see its aftermath?\n\nI was very curious about what the former president was going to say in his speech; the man had a near-death experience. Did that change him as a person? Did that change how he talks about things? Did it change his rhetoric? And I watched his speech and I think we saw a little bit in the beginning when he told the story of that evening. We saw a little bit more tempered-down version and then it went right back into the Trump that we knew.\n\nI am curious to see if that will continue if he will have this more toned down, united rhetoric, or if will he continue to show us that he is the same Trump that we always knew and what that looks like. Is there going to be retribution, since this man, who some people love and I feel some of his supporters feel like they are in a cult, was almost just assassinated? I am curious to see what the remaining months of the election look like.\n\nAfter Saturday, Republicans could have mounted an angry campaign. They did try to talk about unity and project a more humane side of Trump. Does that strike you as interesting or just tactical?\n\nIt was very interesting. It was tactical. But I also think it was just the intensity of the situation. Maybe it was a wake-up call for some folks. And, interestingly, the backdrop and the theme was this call for unity, but then you still had the same people that hate black people, that hate LGBT folks, who were at the centre of it. So it's like unity for who? You are all united in your hate against marginalised folks. But there wasn't this countrywide unity for everyone, no matter what you look like or wherever you come from. There isn't this nationwide unity. It feels like party unity and not uniting the country together.\n\nIs there an increase in support in the Black community for Trump, especially Black men? Polls seem to suggest that a little bit, right? And anecdotally, one can pick a little bit of it.\n\nI get this question a lot. I don't know any of the Black voters for Trump, but that's not to say that they don't exist. There is one guy (a supporter) in Wisconsin who is interviewed in the same press that I am interviewed all the time.\n\nI met someone on my way here. A Black man from the Dominican Republic, now a US citizen, a software engineer and a Lyft driver. He said he was a devout Christian and his values aligned with Trump. And then I tried to narrow it down and asked him about the specific values. And abortion was a big thing for him. I am not saying that that's representative of course.\n\nI think it goes to show that people are frustrated by the candidates that we have now. Biden wasn't my first choice either. But what I am seeing is not folks going from Biden to Trump, but folks debating, am I voting for Biden or am I showing up at all? I don't see them jumping completely to the other side. It's like Trump doesn't align with my values, there is no way I'm ever voting for him, but I don't know what Biden has done, so I may not vote at all.\n\nThe Biden-Harris debate\n\nThat's a great segue for me to ask my next question. What's happening in the Democratic party and what should happen? Do you think Biden should drop out?\n\nI honestly don't know. I was watching the reporting and there was a letter that came out and one of our own state's congressmen has signed on to that letter asking him to leave. I was someone who wanted a more progressive candidate months ago. If there were conversations about him stepping aside, I wish this would have been months ago. I am really worried about how late this is. We just came off the heels of the RNC, the DNC (Democratic National Convention) is in a few weeks and then it's November. And so again, it sounds strange as someone who has been very critical and openly said, I didn't want to have Biden, but I think we have missed that window. And if something isn't decided in the next 24-48 hours, I think folks are in trouble. But honestly, I wish these conversations were months ago and not now.\n\nBut do you think that's still less preferable at this stage than Biden?\n\nFor me personally, I would like to see somebody more progressive. But I don't think that's realistic right now. I say this as someone who did not vote for her in the primaries. But if it isn't Biden, it has to be Kamala Harris. Her being the first Black woman vice president, it would be hard for members of our own community, especially the older generations that have seen all of this, to know the importance of representation and what it means for her being there, to accept someone else. It would backfire if they try to put Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Newsom because I think people see Kamala is next, Vice President Harris is next, and I think you would lose folks if you try to put somebody else in. You will lose the old-school Black folks who have a lot of respect for her and see her as potentially the next president. So I don't know what should happen, but whatever people want to do, they got to figure it out and figure it out fast.\n\nWhy is it that the most support that Biden has retained is actually from the Black Caucus?\n\nA: When I think of the Black community and the Black Caucus, I think of it in a generational sense. A lot of the younger folks are a lot more progressive and want to push a little bit more. Whereas a lot of the older folks, and even our congresswoman, Gwen Moore, have a different picture analysis. And they may have a realistic sense of, yeah, I may want a different person, but this is our reality. I think they are a lot more pragmatic and instead of pushing for better, they are just like, this is what it is we do.\n\nI thought of this in 2020 also and the fact that South Carolina and Jim Clyburn (a top Black Congressional leader) saved Biden's candidacy. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nEvery four years, we find ourselves having the same conversations. This is the first time that I think those conversations have resulted in the situation that we are in now. But those conversations have been because the Black community because the stakes are so high, has prioritised viability.\n\nNeither Biden nor Kamala appears viable at the moment. Do you agree?\n\nI think Kamala is more viable than Biden. Some of it is her energy level and her ability to relate. I wouldn't be as nervous watching a debate if it was Kamala Harris. If it's Joe Biden, I am nervous.\n\nA Black woman president\n\nDo you see a country that has never elected a woman ready to elect a woman, a Black woman, an Indian-American woman, and a woman who is on the progressive side as president?\n\nI know. I know. Those are all good points. I don't know if we are ready per se, but I think in contrast to what the alternative is, I think some folks would get ready. There is a younger fresh energy with Kamala Harris. If the situation was different and it was a more normal election, then absolutely, my first thought would be like, I don't know if we are ready to elect a woman president yet. I wish we were. But right now, I don't know if people are talking about that part of the electability because it's like, here's this existential threat to democracy. So the typical electability questions about race and gender don't seem to be at play right now in the way that they typically would. I don't hear people talking about that. That's very interesting.\n\nThat's very interesting. Are you are suggesting this may be the best time because there are other issues at play?\n\nYes. Like I said, if this was a different election, then her race and gender would stand out a lot more. But right now, someone is just like, who can beat Trump? So it's taking away some of the other barriers that Black women experience when they run for office.\n\nWhat did you think of her VP term? Is there only misogyny and racism behind why the media narrative about her is what it is? Or do you think that she just wasn't able to perform and live up to expectations?\n\nI don't know. I know she was doing the best she could. I know she was out talking about immigration when a lot was happening at the border. Biden sent her to be the one to go visit the border. But I think also, at the same time, the vice president doesn't have much to do. Just attend events, give speeches, and shake hands. She has done that. She's made notable trips to Milwaukee. She is coming back on Tuesday, which will be very interesting if there are decisions over the weekend and I was like, is this going to be the first campaign stop as a presidential candidate? We will see. But I think she is relatable to folks. People see her as a kind of auntie, she is young, and we know her.\n\nSo just to understand this right, you still think it's safer to stick with Biden, but if it is Kamala, momentum can be generated for her?\n\nThe reason I say it's safer to stay with Biden is because of the timing. So if he were to drop out, then it has to be Kamala, in my opinion. It has to be.\n\nThe fear of Trumpist agenda\n\nLet me go back to Trump. What is the biggest fear - or the three big fears -- that you have if Trump gets elected?\n\nI am going to give one because I think it encompasses everything. Fascism, quite frankly; rolling back every single human right that we have, not even the ones that we're debating currently in this country, but things like clean drinking water and environment regulation. I think there is real concern about mass deportations. There are real concerns about LGBT folks and the care that they can receive. We also noticed an uptick since 2016 in hate crimes against different marginalised folks. If Trump is back in office, are people feeling more emboldened to do all of that? And then they are going to make sure that their ability to have guns isn't deterred. And so I think all of that is just like this rise in fascism. If we lose our democracy, we lose everything and everything that comes with it. There is no conversation about policy. There is no conversation about term limits when you have a dictator. And this is what he said he wants to be. So to me, that's the big overarching thing.\n\nLet me push back on that based on the three things I heard at the convention. The first is the Republican focus on inflation, domestic manufacturing, the perils of globalisation, working class over Wall Street rhetoric; they even got a union leader to come and speak. All of it made me feel this is what the Left was saying for 40 years and that there is today a working-class orientation to the party that Trump has fashioned. The second was immigration, and the subtext may be racist, but the framing of it, as a nation having secure borders, isn't necessarily a radical Right argument. And then there was foreign policy where they projected Democrats as presiding over wars, criticised their party for Iraq and Afghanistan went after the Bush crowd, and said they would limit this. So two of these issues -- economy and foreign policy -- hew close to the Left, and one of them - borders -- is a nationalist argument.\n\nSure sure. I think what was interesting is that it felt like it wasn't getting to the heart of what working Americans feel. There can be a lot of rhetoric in this working-class narrative. I will be very curious to see how that continues to play out and how they lean into that, because, at the same time, they are not a party that is friends to working-class folks. So it would be interesting, how they continue to spin it. I think what I noticed is that it just felt like everything was just big and abstract.\n\nOn borders, why in Wisconsin is that an issue for us? Granted, he is talking to everybody. But you see people trying to rally up things around immigration in states that it never will even impact. So I feel like what they are trying to do is do an us versus them that's rooted in anti-Blackness and xenophobia.\n\nThey suggested that immigrants are coming and taking Black jobs or Hispanic jobs.\n\nPlease tell me what the hell is a Black or Hispanic job. I don't know. And Twitter has been having a field day, and I love all the memes on it since he said that at the debate. But yes, I caught that there was this intentional trying to pit Black and Brown people against each other too. It's interesting what they are doing. They are trying to do this divide and conquer, but then they are also only talking about things that feel abstract, that sounds good on the face. Like, oh, maybe we should close our borders, or maybe we should protect this. They are saying it using a very innocent type of framing, but they are not talking about what they are banning. They are not talking about voter suppression. They did not talk about abortion. The things that people are experiencing on a day-to-day basis they didn't talk about. They wanted to give these big theories.\n\nAnd I felt all of those things in those three kinds of frames that you mentioned are all kind of rooted in this America First xenophobia. We are going to take care of our home. We are not going to give money to anyone else. We have to take it. I think this is appealing to some folks when you are struggling and they are like, yeah, why are my tax dollars going to fund war crimes in Gaza and stuff like that? But I think that they are doing it in a way that is trying to also paint Black and Brown people as villains like you need to be worried about those people. That's how it is coming across.\n\nThe Democrats and race\n\nIsn't it a historic failure of the Left that the Right can appropriate these issues in the first place?\n\nAbsolutely. Because I always say if Democrats had a real answer and understanding of how to talk about racism or even police violence, they wouldn't constantly get back into a corner. And so they are always playing defence, not offence because they don't know how to talk about race.\n\nHow should they talk about race?\n\nBy being honest. By naming policies. By not being afraid of using terms like white supremacy or state-sanctioned violence. Let's take a clear example and go back to the shooting that happened the other day here. Democrats are always decrying and talking about gun violence. When a cop shoots somebody, everyone is quiet about gun violence. How is that not gun violence as well? And there are ways that we could be talking about things such as reparations. It seems like every Black issue people are afraid to talk about because they are like, it's complicated.\n\nMaybe the assumption is that if they talk about it, it will alienate the White vote.\n\nThere has been some of that with elected officials who are like, I have to be careful what I say because I am trying to cater to some of the moderates. And so if you are not saying anything, then it allows the Republican party to fill the gap of what you are not saying. And to be like, okay, well there's no narrative on this. We get to create one. And because they are the first and the loudest, Democrats will always be caught having to play defence.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"},

Sentinel Women's Luncheon at a luxury hotel in Century City, talking about how reproductive health care rights are under threat and noting the impact women have on the upcoming presidential election.\n\nFast forward just three months and President Joe Biden would exit the race, putting Harris, who has already broken significant gender and racial barriers in her career, in position to lead women another step forward: to the presidency.\n\nHarris isn't officially the Democratic Party's presidential nominee -- the process for just how the nominating process will play out next month is still a bit murky -- but in just 24 hours, she quickly shored up support from leading Democratic lawmakers, delegates (including from Southern California) and donors. Team Harris announced Monday that it raised $81 million in the first 24 hours after Biden's announcement, the greatest haul during a 24-hour span of any candidate ever, the campaign said.\n\nThat support, financial and otherwise, is indicative of voters' excitement to elect the country's first woman -- the first Black woman and first person of Indian descent -- to the White House, said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a national organization that elevates the political role of women of color.\n\n\"People are completely thrilled and excited, and it feels tangible,\" said Allison, who noted there are already several large organizing events for Harris being planned by California activists. \"I haven't seen this kind of energy and enthusiasm, this electricity, in a long time.\"\n\n\"This is an incredibly exciting time for California and California women, many who were all in for Hillary Clinton (in 2016), wrote checks and organized communities to call into swing states, and then got their hearts broken,\" she said. \"We learned a lot from that experience, and one of the things we in California learned is: We have the resources here, and the will, to elevate a woman of color into the White House.\"\n\nAllison and other local Democratic activists are likening the excitement bubbling around Harris to that seen with Barack Obama's successful White House bid in 2008.\n\nObama was the first president Nia Evans, vice chair of the Laguna Beach Democratic Club, cast a ballot for -- and she feels that motivation is back with Harris.\n\n\"It's an excitement we haven't felt in so long,\" Evans, 32, said. \"The fact that she's a woman is so exciting; a woman of color is even more thrilling.\"\n\nWhile Evans said she's still processing the news of the weekend, others in her organization are already looking ahead. One woman in the club has already booked a room in Washington, D.C., for the 2025 inauguration, she said.\n\nExcitement for Harris can be attributed to myriad reasons.\n\nShe's 59, significantly younger than the 81-year-old president who faced mounting pressure to exit the race as concerns about his age and mental competency raised. She's also nearly two decades younger than former President Donald Trump, who secured the GOP nomination just last week.\n\nShe's an experienced politician who has run successful campaigns for state attorney general and U.S. Senate before serving as the vice president for the past three-and-a-half years. And while her 2020 presidential campaign was unsuccessful, she was ultimately picked to be Biden's running mate, becoming the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.\n\nBut for local voters, she's one of them, a Californian.\n\nHarris is an Oakland native, born to immigrant parents, who resides in the L.A. neighborhood of Brentwood when she isn't in Washington, D.C. She grew up in Bay Area politics, first winning a race as San Francisco's district attorney some 20 years ago.\n\n\"She has already served as a role model for women in California,\" said Linda Verraster, president of the Democratic Women of South Orange County. \"Her experience goes a long way for promoting women and familes in California and the country as a whole.\"\n\nHarris at the top of the ticket \"is symbolic of how powerful women in California are in national politics,\" said Martha Johnson, an expert in women's studies and gendered[ politics who teaches at Northeastern University Oakland. \"We've had two of the most important female senators come from California (in Dianne Feinstein and Harris). And if you think about it, I don't think any of this would have happened if Nancy Pelosi wasn't so influential in Biden stepping down.\"\n\n\"Harris is more demonstrating to us the power that California women are having in politics and speaks to the amount of influence the state has,\" said Johnson.\n\nExcitement aside, local activists and analysts note that we've been here - wondering if the nation is ready to elect the first woman to the White House - before.\n\nBut there are some stark differences between when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led the Democratic ticket in 2016 and now, they said.\n\n\"The stakes are higher,\" said Evans. \"As exciting as it was when Hillary was running, I don't think we realized what an obstacle was ahead of us. We didn't know what Trump was capable of, and also thought he had no chance of winning. It's a completely different playing field now.\"\n\nWomen, when it comes to executive office, are often held to different standards because there's an implicit stereotype that the person in the role should embody what have generally been considered masculine traits, like competitiveness or toughness, Johnson said.\n\nHarris' campaign can use her background - her work as a prosecutor as well as her racial and ethnic background and gender - to paint her as someone new to lead the country, Johnson said. And while there's still implicit and explicit racism and sexism in politics, Johnson said, her campaign might be able still to use gender to its advantage.\n\n\"It's not 2016 anymore, and people know more about Trump now,\" said Johnson. \"Roe v. Wade hadn't been overturned yet (when Clinton ran). We've seen a remarkable shift in women voters in terms of their alignment with the Democratic Party.\"\n\nHarris' identities, and her ability to speak to them, are also tantamount, said Allison.\n\n\"Californians understand it. Shorthand, she's a Black woman leader, but she is Black and Asian American,\" said Allison. \"It actually matters that there is space in her leadership for multiple identities. More than other places, I think that Californians appreciate that and appreciate the complexity of identities and that motivates people to vote.\"\n\n\"She is pulling together a coalition that appeals to people of color, women of color, younger voters,\" Allison continued. \"She has a different coalition than even Biden. Back when Hillary Clinton ran, the Democratic Party wasn't as clear as how much they need to support Black women and leaders.\"\n\nBut a sitting president, endorsing his vice president who is a woman of color, to take over the top of the ticket, shows a change, Allison said.\n\n\"Something deep has shifted. It's closing the door on Biden but opening an important door for Kamala Harris and other women of color who come behind her,\" she said. \"Our politics are evolving to becoming more realistic to who lives in our country.\"\n\nThe country, Verraster said, is ready for a female president. But a woman from California, she said, now that's just a bonus.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A repurposed drug could extend women's fertility, the pay gap doesn't appear to be going away, and Black women rally behind Kamala Harris. Have a terrific Tuesday!\n\n- Keep winning. On Sunday night, 44,000 people logged onto Zoom -- and raised $1.5 million. They gathered to talk about how to support Vice President Kamala Harris in her newly announced run for the presidency.\n\nThe gathering was hosted by the group Win With Black Women -- and in less than three hours, the network raised $1.5 million for the new expected Democratic nominee. With donations ranging from $3 to the maximum allowed under federal election law, Black women and allies including Latinas, AAPI women, and Black men registered their full-throated support for Harris as she takes over the campaign from President Joe Biden.\n\nFor Jotaka Eaddy, who first convened the group in 2020, it was a \"full-circle moment.\" Win With Black Women was founded in August 2020 in response to what its founding members saw as racism and sexism in the conversation about who would be Biden's vice presidential pick. At the time, think pieces debated whether Harris was \"too ambitious\" for the job. So it was especially meaningful to see the network grow to tens of thousands of supporters, this time explicitly supporting Harris in her bid for the nation's top job.\n\nIn total, the Harris campaign raised $81 million in its first 24 hours, the campaign said. Sixty percent of 880,000 donors were making their first contribution of the 2024 election cycle, the Guardian reported. Harris gave her first speech as a 2024 presidential candidate yesterday, combatting her opponent Donald Trump (she said that as a prosecutor, she \"know[s] [his] type\") and presenting her own vision for the country.\n\nWin With Black Women has been meeting most Sunday nights over the past four years. \"We were ready. Black women were ready to come together, to unite,\" Eaddy says. Participants on the off-the-record call included corporate leaders, lawmakers, TV executives, actors and reality stars, union leaders, and more, Eaddy says. Author Luvvie Ajayi Jones, Blavity CEO Morgan DeBaun, and Fearless Fund founding partner Arian Simone shared an Instagram graphic that reads \"I was one of the 44,000.\" Other attendees included Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Mo.), according to Bloomberg, and New York Attorney General Tish James and Planned Parenthood CEO Alexis McGill Johnson, according to Politico.\n\nSince first convening during the 2020 campaign cycle, Win With Black Women has galvanized support for other causes, not all in politics. The group advocated to bring home WNBA star Brittney Griner while she was detained in Russia and has supported projects in entertainment like Ava DuVernay's film Origin.\n\nEaddy says she appreciates the power that the diverse group of women bring to this cause. \"We leverage our individual power for our collective unity and agenda,\" she says. \"We'll be working hand in hand with other Black-women led organizations and allies, with Americans across the country to realize this historic moment where we will see the first Black women, first woman president of the United States.\"\n\n- Bipartisan criticism. Republicans and Democrats both criticized Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle in a House hearing about the attempted assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. Some urged Cheatle to resign. CNBC\n\n- Open results. The results of OpenResearch's decade-long study of universal basic income, started by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and led by researcher Elizabeth Rhodes, were released yesterday. The study found that unconditional cash grants went toward participants' basic needs like food and housing but likely aren't enough to fully counter any AI-related job loss. Wired\n\n- Watch the gap. A recent study from the Center for Economic Policy Research shows that the gender pay gap will not disappear -- ever. A shrinking of the gap in recent decades has relied on older generations with large pay gaps retiring, and the narrowing is not expected to continue. Bloomberg\n\n- Backing baskets. Ally Financial has become the founding partner for Unrivaled, a three-on-three women's basketball league, through a multimillion-dollar deal. Unrivaled was started by WNBA players Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier and will launch in 2025. Sportico\n\n- Pressing pause. Early results testing the efficacy and safety of rapamycin, an immunosuppressant, show that it could extend women's fertility by five years. The drug could slow the aging of ovaries, delay menopause, and improve women's quality of life. The Guardian\n\n- Bulgari promoted Laura Burdese to deputy chief executive officer. Burdese is currently Bulgari's vice president of marketing and communication.\n\n- Seedtag appointed Farah Golant to its board of directors; she previously served as CEO of All3Media.\n\n- My Code appointed Marchelle Johnson \"MJ\" Wright as chief people officer. She was previously chief people officer at Group Black.\n\nHigher prices on tampons, pads prompt hard choices for Americans Wall Street Journal\n\n\"Like most things with this industry, they're like,

Ohio Democrats are glad it won't happen.", "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It would have been must-see TV had Democrats gathered next month to actually pick a presidential candidate during their national convention in Chicago.\n\nBut with the election just more than three months away, Ohio Democrats like those elsewhere are moving toward a less interesting, but much more orderly convention by quickly coalescing around Vice President Kamala Harris after President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he won't seek reelection.\n\nIn interviews on Tuesday, several Democrats said they're eager to move on from questions surrounding Biden's candidacy so they can focus on beating former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nThey also acknowledged a lack of voter enthusiasm surrounding a second four-year term for Biden, something they may not have been willing to say publicly even a week ago.\n\n\"I don't think it's any secret that most of the public outside of political insiders and partisans that there was a lack of enthusiasm for voting for two older men for many blocs of voters,\" said Allison Russo, an Upper Arlington state representative who is the top Democrat in the Ohio House. \"The way that has done a complete 180-degere shift in the past 48 hours has been really exciting to watch.\"\n\nBeyond the unquestionable voter interest, a \"mini-primary\" may have granted some additional political seasoning and democratic legitimacy to Harris had she won. Republicans have portrayed the likely switch from Biden to Harris as a shady backroom deal that disregards the results of this year's primary election.\n\nBut Democrats said Tuesday the unprecedented situation and limited time until the November election calls for decisive action.\n\n\"We have about 100 days until the election, and we have to put in the work to pick a nominee and turn people out to vote,\" said Morgan Harper, a lawyer and activist in Columbus who's a Democratic National Convention delegate. \"We have to coalesce quickly, and I think that's the right move.\"\n\nJordan Hawkins, a political operative who leads the Ohio Young Black Democrats, said voters always have understood that Harris might potentially end up taking over for the 81-year-old Biden. So nominating her is the best option for making a change while still observing the wishes of the 14 million people who voted for the president during this year's Democratic primary elections, which weren't competitive after Biden failed to draw a serious challenger.\n\n\"That's the way we look at it ... Versus having a more select group of people, albeit our delegates are people we trust, to pick somebody completely new,\" Hawkins said.\n\nDavid Brock, chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, said recent history suggests that contentious conventions should be avoided.\n\n\"The last three times there have been really contentious conventions, that party has lost,\" he said, citing the Democratic National Conventions in 1968 and 1980 and the Republican National Convention in 1976. \"And I think that really tells you how difficult it is in a three-month period to be able to come back together.\n\n\"Plus, Vice President Harris is more than capable,\" Brock said.\n\nAaron Pickrell, a Democratic strategist who has run presidential campaigns in Ohio, said there might be benefits to a competitive primary-style contest. But he said it's not practical this late in the election calendar.\n\n\"If this had been a year ago or something like that you can see arguments,\" Pickrell said. \"But ultimately I think the vice-president is a really strong candidate.\"\n\nThat speaks to another aspect of picking Harris that Democrats said they're excited about. They believe Harris, who is Black and of Indian descent, and 20 years younger than Trump, will be able to energize young women and Black voters. A lack of Black voter turnout has been one of Ohio Democrats' many longstanding issues, most recently in 2022, when it contributed to Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan soundly losing to now-Sen. JD Vance, this year's GOP vice presidential nominee, despite mounting what had appeared to be a competitive campaign.\n\nHarper said she is part of a standing weekly conference call with Black women who are active in progressive politics. Sunday's call, which took place hours after Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, saw a huge spike of interest, attracting tens of thousands of attendees, including some who aren't typical political insiders, she said. Hawkins said something similar about a standing call for Black men in politics.\n\n\"I think people already understood the threat that electing Donald Trump and JD Vance represented for us as Ohioans and Americans who believe in freedom for everyone,\" Harper said. \"And now there seems to be a lot of extra enthusiasm about people investing their personal capital, whether it's money, time or canvassing into making sure that we do what we can to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A sitting president has never decided to forgo running for reelection this late in the process. Democratic primary voters have been essentially disenfranchised by party elites, who are convinced that President Biden is a sure loser against former President Trump.\n\nAfter an intense and orchestrated pressure campaign, Biden saw the writing on the wall, and today decided that he would not run for reelection. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to step down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nMAGA world seems unfazed by the last minute switch. Some believe that Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely new nominee, would be as easy to beat as Biden, if not more. While that may be true, the Republicans are making a mistake if they underestimate their new opponent.\n\nThe Trump campaign is courting minorities as a part of their new coalition. They have chosen this path over trying to win Biden/Haley college educated suburban voters who used to comprise the GOP's base. While I believe that it is a wise decision for the future of the GOP, that path has become more complicated now that Trump has to run against the likely first Black female presidential candidate.\n\nTrump could have chosen a woman or a person of color as his vice presidential candidate as a bulwark against the possibility of this switch and having to run against the \"historic\" narrative. Instead, he chose J.D. Vance, a candidate tailor made to reinforce his strengths among the White, Midwestern working class (a group that Biden over-performed with in 2020).\n\nHarris is weaker with white working class voters, but she could be stronger with minorities, particularly if the Trump campaign does nothing to blunt that effort. As of today, the outreach to Black and Hispanic communities has still been anemic. They are going to have to do far more now that they are likely running against a Black woman. The campaign should be releasing policy objectives tailored to those communities, teasing out potential members of the Trump cabinet and investing significantly in messaging on Black and Hispanic media outlets.\n\nVance in particular should revisit a conversation he had on my show The Outlaws two years ago, when he spoke on the importance of the Republican Party replacing the \"country club set\" with Black and Hispanic working class voters. On the show, he articulated how during the FDR era, the Black and white working class voted together, and how the Republican Party could be the governing party for a generation if they pursued a reunion of those groups. They should overtly tailor their message to those communities, making it abundantly clear that the \"America First\" agenda includes them in it. They should also push back on attempts from the Right to attack those communities.\n\nTrump's attacks against \"Project 2025\" shows that he has little fear of going against the hard Right. He should do the same whenever loud mouth, stupid so called \"conservative\" provocateurs attack or demean minority communities.\n\nTo be clear, Trump still has the advantage. Most polls have shown him ahead of Harris as well as Biden. But if they take Harris for granted, it will be the worst mistake of their campaign. If they want the Black and Hispanic voters that they are counting on, they are now going to have to fight for them.\n\nDarvio Morrow is CEO of the FCB Radio Network and co-host of The Outlaws Radio Show.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disfranchisement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It's about to run a person whose parents were immigrants against a xenophobe who supports mass deportations. It's about to run a woman who prosecuted sexual predators against a sexual predator who has been judged to be a rapist. And it's about to run a fierce defender of reproductive rights against a person who proudly claims responsibility for overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nAdd it all up, and what you get is that the Democrats are about to run the walking embodiment of what America is against the avenging specter of what America was.\n\nThe contrast between Vice President Kamala Harris and convicted felon Donald Trump could not be more clear, and that contrast should benefit Harris in every conceivable way. Harris is a person who wouldn't be allowed to finish her sentences in Trump's America, much less hold political and legal power. The distinction is now between a youthful, vibrant, and tolerant vision of the country, versus an aging, aggrieved, and absolutist version of America.\n\nDemocrats should be thrilled with the opportunity to run Donald Trump's worst nightmare against Donald Trump. And the base is. ActBlue, the small-dollar donations aggregator, smashed fundraising records on the first day of Harris's presidential campaign. Elder party poohbas and young rising Democratic stars all quickly endorsed Harris for president. \"Win With Black Women,\" a network of Black women grassroots organizers, had a call last night that broke Zoom, and ended up with over 40,000 participants who raised over a million dollars for Harris.\n\nThe contrast Harris provides to Trump is her greatest electoral asset, a thing that is energizing the very people Trump would harm the most -- but we, as a nation, are about to endure weeks and months of people telling us that it is her greatest weakness. The question \"Is America ready for a Black, female president?\" will be posed again and again by people who will claim that they already know the answer is \"no.\" Even as Harris consolidates the entire Democratic Party around her and her campaign, there will be people telling her she can't win because America won't elect a woman of color.\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

BOSSIP previously reported on the record-breaking $1.5 million that the grassroots organization Win With Black Women rallied for the Howard University alumni. Today, we have more money-makin' news to share!\n\nWWBW's brother organization, Win With Black Men, held their own Zoom call last night, and according to the call's host Roland S. Martin, 53,862 attendees raised another $1.3 million for VP Harris' ever-increasing campaign coffers.\n\nCo-host of the WWBM call, political operative Bakari Sellers, shared an emotional story on the call about why he is hell-bent on seeing VP Harris take the oath of office in January 2025. Sellers' wife nearly lost her life giving birth to the couple's twin daughters who were both born with a rare liver disease.\n\nVia AJC:\n\n\"I will never forget, the first person to call me...,\" he said, pausing for 20 seconds to get the words out. \" ... was Kamala Harris. I am not sure people understand the pain and suffering that goes along with being a Black man in this country. I am not sure people understand what it means to stand strong in this country. To have your back against the wall. But I am going to stand with her because she stood with me, during my darkest moment when I almost lost my daughter. When I had to protect my wife.\"\n\nAccording to APNews reporting, within 24 hours of President Biden dropping out of the race, the Harris campaign has taken in $81 million across all platforms including the Democratic National Committee and other fundraising committees. That dollar amount represents the biggest day of donations on either side of the aisle in the 2024 campaign. Harris spokesperson Kevin Munoz says it was the biggest day of donations in United States history.\n\n\"The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,\" Munoz said.\n\nHopefully, this new burst of enthusiasm will carry through for the next 3 months because VP Harris is going to need every single vote imaginable to defeat Donald Trump and put MAGA in the dirt where it belongs.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakari_Sellers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bakari Sellers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Martin_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roland Martin (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlanta_Journal-Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2024/07/17217524067891.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Delegates, selected to represent their states or communities at their party's nominating convention and tasked with selecting the party's candidate for the November ballot, typically consist of early supporters, party activists, or political leaders, as reported by USA Today.\n\nFollowing President Joe Biden's endorsement of Harris after his withdrawal announcement, Democrats rallied behind the California native. According to an Associated Press survey, Harris, the first Black and South Asian Vice President, has garnered 2,688 delegates, significantly exceeding the 1,976 delegates needed for nomination, with 54 delegates still undecided.\n\nHarris is now the presumptive nominee, but her path to the presidency still demands diligent effort. Convention delegates retain the freedom to vote for their preferred candidate at the August convention or during a potential virtual roll call before the Democratic National Convention set to take place in Chicago.\n\nSupport for Kamala Harris is strong among all Black Democrats\n\nJust a few hours after Harris accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for president, NewsOne senior editor and author asha bandele joined an off-the-record private Zoom call for Black women led by the legendary Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, and Congresswoman and Joyce Beatty (D-Oh), and which featured Rep.Jasmine Crockett (D-Tx). The call, roughly two hours long, originally allotted for 1,000 guests grew exponentially, causing the organizers to open up platforms to accommodate all. The pride and excitement was palpable, bandele reported.\n\nSource: Scott Eisen / Getty\n\nFurther, she shared with NewsOne that \"Donna Brazile was masterful in explaining how Black women could help ensure the Vice President had the votes to secure the nomination, but the truly incredible thing was that because more than 1,000 women tried to get on, systems started crashing and in the end, it took likely an hour -- and a whole different platform to get us together,\" bandele said. \"But it was truly amazing to bear witness, in this age of impatience, how everyone stayed on, giving grace. It was like no one wanted to release the moment. By the end of the call, 1,000 people became 44,000 people.And of course, in under two days, the votes to ensure the Vice President's nomination were secured.\"\n\nPassion for the Vice President was also strong during a conference call held Monday night. In that gathering, the target audience was Black men. Hosted by Roland Martin, at least 35,000 Black men joined. Speakers included Gov. Wes Moore, Benjamin Crump, Mark Morial, and Derrick Johnson who leads the NAACP. They were deeply impactful in demonstrating how key every single vote was, and that there was no sitting this one out, bandele learned from one of the men who was present. More, she told NewsOne that while there were links to donate to the campaign available, there was no real push to donate.\n\nNevertheless, at least $1.3m was raised, bandele was told.\n\nSee More:\n\nWhy Fear About Kamala Harris' Candidacy Is Misguided\n\nBlack Voters Matter Announce 'We Fight Back' Campaign & Bus Tour For The 2024 Election Season\n\n\"Good Trouble\": Who Is Upholding John Lewis' Voting Rights Legacy? 10 photos", "source": {"uri": "newsone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News One"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shannon_dawson@newsone.com", "name": "Shannon Dawson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_One", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Urban One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Brazile", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donna Brazile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Beatty", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joyce Beatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Martin_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roland Martin (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://newsone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2023/04/1681159656684.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

We want to have that same groundswell and that feeling. Again, this isn't about party. This is about us showing up and making the best decisions for our community. And again, I believe that best decision is Vice President Kamala Harris being the Democratic nominee, and hopefully being our next president for these United States. That's\n\nI think it's a couple of different approaches. One, we start repeating that narrative, whether you we just want brothers to vote, if you show up in the ballot box and you get the proper information. I believe you're gonna vote the way I vote. When you start looking at the history and truly doing your own research and getting a better understanding for what policies and positions are going to be the best answer for our community. They're going to make the decision that I've come to I truly believe that. Number two, I think we have to support our communities and our brothers and men like me and you to say, look, it's okay that you you're frustrated. There is not one person that I think he's been in elected office, that's a perfect human being because none of us are. And so making sure that there's not a litmus test or a purity test that we're going to hold one particular party to and not hold the other two, I think is a detriment to us all. Then thirdly, again, show up we're not just talking about President United States, we're talking about down the ballot who represents you who makes a decision about whether or not they're going to be bike lanes or speed bumps in your communities, whether it's a traffic light there, whether there's more police, whether there's more schools, all of these are important issues that are not just for the presidency.\n\nIt is important that I believe we show up and support Kamala Harris, our Vice President who's I want to be the nominee for the Democratic Party. But it's not just about her. I think when we make it about one particular person, then each election is just about that person. We are calling for a transformative moment that this election is about our communities that we are electing. People and hiring people that are going to represent our communities and bring the best for our communities back when they're in office.", "source": {"uri": "atlantadailyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Daily World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalil_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khalil Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Blake_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Blake (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakari_Sellers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bakari Sellers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Martin_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roland Martin (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Man_March", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Million Man March"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://atlantadailyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/kamala-harris-4-scaled-e1721742762360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749920", "eventUri": "eng-9749920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

'Win With Black Women' Rallies $1.5 Million For VP Kamala Harris, Small Donors Dropped $60 Million Via ActBlue\n\n2024 has a been a hell of a year and yesterday things escalated to a new level.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced that he was dropping out of the presidential race after previously taking a defiant tone toward those suggesting that he should do so. The surprising declaration came in the wake of \"Democrats\" like Senator Joe Manchin coming out publicly to plead with a seemingly ailing Biden to remove himself from the campaign.\n\nPresident Biden didn't chunk a deuce before giving a full-throated endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris to take the reins and defeat Donald Trump in November. Despite the \"Where's Waldo?\" criticism that VP Harris has received over the course of the Biden administration, the news of her potential candidacy (We say \"potential\" because there is still a process that has to take place for her to become the official candidate. However, it's a bit of a foregone conclusion) was met with extreme excitement by Black women who appeared even more invigorated to mobilize with the idea of \"President Kamala Harris\" standing before them. An organization called Win With Black Women held an open Zoom call that moderator Jotaka Eaddy says reached 40,000 viewers at its peak. The call garnered so much support that $1.5 million was raised in just 3 hours!\n\nSkepticism around whether or not VP Harris can defeat Trump is divisively deep, however, this type of fundraising has to be noted as a sign of a base who is more ready to fight now than they were with an octogenarian white man with waning support from inside the party.\n\nIt isn't just organizations like Win With Black Women who made it rain on them Joes. According to Newsweek's reporting, another grassroots operation called ActBlue took in donations that tallied $46.7 million within a business day's time of Biden's big announcement. Several hours later, it was reported by KTVU that the number had risen to $60 million.\n\nTime to punch the clock. Election day is right around the corner.", "source": {"uri": "bossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bossip"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActBlue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ActBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where's_Waldo?_(2019_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Where's Waldo?

Donald Trump\n\nAs US President Joe Biden faces mounting pressure to withdraw his reelection bid, allies are exploring ways to publicly show support for him among key factions of the Democratic Party, according to reports citing three Democrats familiar with the issue.\n\nThe initiative aims to counter pressure on Biden by highlighting feelings of dissatisfaction among voters who feel marginalized by efforts to sideline the candidate they voted for, NBC News reported.\n\nThis effort includes both spontaneous displays of support from organizations and constituencies concerned by the risk of internal party strife jeopardizing Democtats' chances of defeating Donald Trump.\n\nThese supporters include Black clergy, Latino community leaders, and progressive activists, showcasing grassroots backing for the president.\n\nIn addition, the Biden campaign is looking to harness and incorporate this support into its own defense of the president, as outlined by the three party members familiar with the talks.\n\nOne prominent Biden supporter focused on engaging Black voters expressed concern, saying: \"If the Democratic elites push Biden out and disenfranchise 14 million voters like me, the Democratic legislators are no better than Republicans.\"\n\n\"Democrats lose the so-called save democracy argument, and it will appear racist,\" the supporter added.\n\nGalvanizing the core Democratic base, especially Black and Latino voters in battleground states, serves as a warning to major donors, party leaders in Washington, and candidates facing elections this November, who rely on these voters to secure victories and challenge Trump, regardless of his opponent.\n\nThis push comes as Biden confronts dwindling options to revive a campaign losing support from lawmakers and donors.\n\nIn a recent call organized by the Biden campaign with Vice President Kamala Harris, some top Democratic donors were directly cautioned by leaders of groups mobilizing Black and Latino voters in battleground states.\n\n\"While we have continuously amplified a message about saving our democracy, within our own party right now, that democracy is currently being commandeered by party elites, donors (and) the media, as opposed to being led by voters and the will of the people,\" said Melissa Morales, the founder of a Latino voter group Somos Votantes.\n\nIf President Biden were to withdraw from the 2024 race, Vice President Harris would likely benefit the most from that decision.\n\nAs his running mate, she is positioned to potentially inherit the substantial financial resources of the campaign.\n\nIf she were to become the Democratic presidential nominee, she would make history as the first Black woman to lead a major-party ticket.\n\nThe push to strengthen grassroots support represents the newest development in an internal struggle within the Democratic Party that has intensified significantly since Biden's uneven debate performance three weeks ago.\n\nDespite mounting pressure for him to suspend his campaign, Biden has not relented and is reportedly furious with longtime allies who are urging him to step aside.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news",

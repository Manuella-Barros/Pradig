{"id": 231276624, "title": "Israel rescues four hostages in Gaza; Palestinians report 50 dead", "text": "Al-Nuseirat, a historic Palestinian refugee camp, has been subjected to heavy Israeli bombing during the war and there also has been fierce ground fighting in its eastern areas. Gaza\u2019s health ministry meanwhile reported on Saturday that Israeli military assaults in al-Nuseirat had killed and wounded dozens of people including women and children. The ministry did not say how many of the fatalities were combatants. A health ministry official put the death toll at more than 50, saying emergency response teams were trying to ferry the dead and wounded to hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah but many bodies were still lying in the streets, including around a market district. Local residents said al-Nuseirat had come under heavy Israeli drone and air strikes, and that those who were killed included women and children. Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the rescue operation was carried out under fire in the heart of a residential neighbourhood where he said Hamas had been hiding captives among Gaza civilians under armed guard of militants. In a televised news conference, Hagari said one Israeli soldier had been badly wounded. The Israeli forces returned fire, Hagari he said, including with airstrikes. The Gaza war shows no signs of slowing even as Israel\u2019s chief ally the United States presses for a ceasefire and a deal that would free the remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for releases of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The war has destabilised the wider Middle East, drawing in Hamas\u2019s main backer Iran and its heavily armed Lebanese ally Hezbollah, which Israeli officials are threatening to go to war with on Israel\u2019s northern border.", "summary": "The Israeli military said it rescued four hostages held since October in a raid.", "url": "https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/israel-rescues-four-hostages-in-gaza-palestinians-report-50-dead/", "image": "https://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Israel-R-1.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:21:40", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "za", "sentiment": -0.292}

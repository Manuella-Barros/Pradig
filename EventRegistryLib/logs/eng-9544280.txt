If you buy from a link, we may earn a commission. Learn more\n\nEven before the concept of EDC really came into existence, a lot of people carried around a Swiss Army Knife. The most ubiquitous multitool in existence, the red-handled knife is cheap, compact and useful, containing a variety of handy tools such as screwdrivers, bottle openers, corkscrews, awls, scissors and, naturally, a blade.\n\nBut that \"knife\" in Swiss Army Knife can prove problematic. If you're used to carrying your Swiss Army Knife in your pocket, you'll need to ditch it before getting onto a plane. You also could run into legal hot water if caught carrying the blade in a city, state or even country where doing so is against the law. To alleviate this risk, Swiss Army Knife-maker Victorinox is crafting a new version of the iconic pocket knife ... without a knife.\n\nIn a recent interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, Victorinox CEO Carl Elsener cited increasing restrictions on public carrying of knives and the \"weapon-like\" image of blades as reasons for new product development.\n\n\"In England or certain Asian countries, you are sometimes only allowed to carry a knife if you need to have it to do your job or operate outdoors,\" Elsener said, according to CNN. \"In the city, however, when you go to school, to the cinema, or to go shopping, carrying pocketknives is severely restricted.\"\n\nTo combat the increasing persona-non-grata status of knives, Victorinox is developing several new products that will incorporate a variety of tools in (presumably) its familiar red guise.

I have in mind creating a tool that would be useful for cyclists. Cyclists have a need for specific tools but not necessarily a blade,\" he said. \"We already have a tool specifically for golfers.\"\n\nThe firm is in the early stages of product development and does not yet have a launch date for the new products.\n\nMr Elsener said in England and certain Asian countries \"you are sometimes only allowed to carry a knife if it is needed to carry out a job or if you are in the outdoors\".\n\n\"Victorinox wants to counteract this trend with the development of blade-less tools for specific outdoor activities or sports,\" he said.\n\nUnder UK law, a person can only carry a knife in public if it has a folding blade that is less than 3 inches (7.62cm) long.\n\nFor all other knives, it is illegal to carry them in public without a good reason. That can include needing the knife for work, wearing it as part of a national costume or for religious reasons, such as the curved kirpan knife carried by some Sikhs.\n\nIt is not the first time the company has had to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, the sales of Swiss Army Knives fell by more than 30 per cent almost overnight because of the ban on sharp objects introduced by airlines.\n\n\"September 11th showed us that we mustn't depend on just one sector of products,\" Mr Elsener said. Victorinox now produces watches, luggage and even fragrances in addition to its pocket knives.\n\nMr Elsener's great-grandfather, a self-employed cutler, started the company when he landed a contract to supply knives to the Swiss army in 1891.

I have in mind creating a tool that would be useful for cyclists. Cyclists have a need for specific tools but not necessarily a blade,\" he said. \"We already have a tool specifically for golfers.\"\n\nLast week, Mr Justice Saini blamed the \"plague of knife crime\" in Bristol and surrounding areas for the murder of 16-year-old Mikey Roynon, a talented teenage rapper stabbed in the neck at a house party in Bath.\n\nThe same week, a 15-year-old boy who stabbed another teenager in the heart in full view of pupils leaving a primary school in Leeds, was found guilty of murder.\n\nThe murders came amid reports of soaring demand for body armour for shopping centre security staff amid a 65% rise in violent and abusive incidents in the past two years.\n\nUnder UK law, a person can only carry a knife in public if it has a folding blade that is less than 3in (7.62cm) long.\n\nFor all other knives, it is illegal to carry them in public without a good reason, which can include needing the knife for work, wearing it as part of a national costume or for religious reasons, such as the curved kirpan knife carried by some Sikhs.\n\nElsener said Victorinox was responding to the tightening of regulations by developing blade-less tools for specific outdoor activities or sports.\n\nVictorinox produces about 10m of the pocket tools each year. There are about 400 different types to choose from, including one that boasts 73 functions. They have even been carried into space by Nasa astronauts.\n\nHowever, until now they have always had at least one blade.\n\nThe company has already had to adapt its products to tightened restrictions on carrying knives and in the aftermath of 9/11 the company's sales fell by 30%.\n\nEven in Switzerland, the home of the brand, there has been discussion about what people are permitted to carry. In 2016, there was a parliamentary debate about banning blades longer than 5cm. One MP even asked: \"Will the famous Swiss army knife be forbidden?\" The proposed amendment was dropped.\n\nThe Swiss army knife was first developed in Ibach, Switzerland, in 1891 and was orginally referred to as an Offiziersmesser, or officer's knife, as the company had a contract to supply knives to the army.\n\nThe product was given the name Swiss army knife six years later.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amelia_hill@theguardian.com", "name": "Amelia Hill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorinox", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victorinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife_legislation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knife legislation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plague (disease)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body armor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Army knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirpan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirpan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibach,_Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ibach, Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibach, Switzerland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Knives", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Knives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f0f81bbeb3cbb8e3c957e335d1b35b6c2e5e42/999_1108_5786_3471/master/5786.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=a3bb363965eb850a999605805dec8f64", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544280", "eventUri": "eng-9544280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

In specific markets, the blade elicits thoughts of weaponry. The purpose of my project is to create a device that passengers will find useful.\n\nIt should be noted that, despite the lack of a blade, cyclists still require certain items. In fact, we already have a device designed specifically for golfers.\"\n\nThe \"plague of knife crime\" in Bristol and the adjacent areas was cited by Mr. Justice Saini as the cause of death for 16-year-old Mikey Roynon, a gifted young rapper who was stabbed in the neck during a house party in Bath, last week. Roynon was a gifted young rapper.\n\nA 15-year-old boy was convicted of murder the same week for fatally stabbing another adolescent in the heart in front of pupils departing from a primary school in Leeds.\n\nIt occurred concurrently with projections that the incidence of violent and abusive incidents at retail centers had escalated by 65% over the preceding two years, thereby stimulating the need for body armor designed for security personnel.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, carrying a knife in public is strictly prohibited for individuals whose folded blade does not exceed 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) in length.\n\nIn all other cases, carrying a knife in public is strictly prohibited unless there is a valid reason to do so. Illustrative instances of valid justifications encompass incorporating the knife into a ceremonial ensemble, carrying it for professional obligations, or pursuing a religious inclination (as some Sikhs adhere to with their curved kirpan knife).\n\nAs a result of stricter regulations, Victorinox is developing bladeless tools for specific outdoor sports or pastimes, according to Elsener.\n\nVictorinox manufactures approximately 10 million of these portable tools annually. One of the approximately 400 variants available serves 73 functions. Additionally, NASA astronauts have carried them into outer space.\n\nAlready requiring product modifications to comply with stricter regulations regarding the carrying of blades, the company experienced a 30% decline in sales following September 11th.\n\nThe subject of permissible carry has been a subject of debate even in Switzerland, the country of origin for the brand. In 2016, a parliamentary debate ensued concerning the prohibition of weapons exceeding 5 centimeters in length. \"Will the renowned Swiss army knife be prohibited?\" a member of parliament inquired. The proposed modification was discarded.\n\nThe Swiss army knife, initially referred to as an Offiziersmesser or officer's knife, was conceptualized in Ibach, Switzerland, in 1891, as a result of a contract between the company and the army to sell cutlery.\n\nThe product was renamed the Swiss army knife six years later.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "salman_ahmad@chiangraitimes.com", "name": "Salman Ahmad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Army knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_(disease)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plague (disease)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorinox", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victorinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body armor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirpan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirpan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutlery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cutlery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibach,_Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ibach, Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibach, Switzerland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Knives", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Knives", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544280", "eventUri": "eng-9544280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-11", "textStart": 2900, "textEnd": 2914}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

In recent years, the company has had to diversify into other products such as watches and perfumes as the strong Swiss franc erodes profits from foreign revenues.\n\nThe Swiss newspaper Blick brought the knifeless pocket knife to CNN's attention. It was about Carl Elsener Jr., the company's CEO, who fears that carrying knives will be increasingly regulated in many countries. Due to the increase in crimes committed with it, the British government is preparing new regulations in this area.\n\n\"In England and some Asian countries, people can only have a knife if they need it for their job. \"For example, if someone goes to the cinema or goes shopping, they are not allowed to have a pocket knife with them,\" said Elsener. In many countries the knife is considered more of a weapon than a tool. That's why the Swiss bicycle manufacturer is developing a tool without a knife, for example for cyclists or other sports enthusiasts.\n\nThey assume that cyclists, for example, don't need a knife when out and about, but rather some basic tools to be able to quickly carry out minor repairs on their bike. This is what the company's developers have in mind. Of course, the new product is offered as a second knife alongside the original Swiss Army Knife, which also includes a knife.\n\nEvery five minutes\n\nAccording to statistics published in Quartz magazine, the Swiss company produces 45,000 Swiss army knives every day.

It's developing a version of its legendary knife -- without a blade.\n\nVictorinox is facing a double-edged sword, and it's not just about helping customers breeze through airport security. Knife violence concerns are on the rise, and in some countries, even a small blade can be seen as a weapon.\n\nIn particular, the company is reinventing the wheel, or pocket tool, in light of a sentencing last week in which Bristol Crown Court judge Mr Justice Saini had warned of a \"plague of knife crime\" after teenage rapper Mikey Roynon was stabbed in the neck during a house party. Roynon's perpetrator, Shane Cunningham, was given a life sentence.\n\nGlobal weapon regulations are also tightening. In 2023, a man in Osaka, Japan, was fined for carrying his Victorinox in his pocket.\n\nVictorinox's bladeless design is still in the early stages, but CEO Carl Elsener mentioned a tool specifically \"useful for cyclists,\" ditching the unnecessary blade in favor of bike-repair focused features.\n\nThe manufacturer churns out 10 million pocket tools a year, with 400 variations -- but all have included at least one blade.\n\nAdapting is nothing new for Victorinox. After 9/11, stricter carry-on restrictions purportedly caused a 30% sales dip.

You never know when you'll need it, and when you do, you really need it! As every good company should, Victorinox, the parent company that makes the iconic Swiss Army Knife, is making a few changes.\n\nSwiss Army Knife manufacturer Victorinox, renowned for its iconic multi-tool designs, is developing new multi-tools without blades in response to increasingly stringent knife regulations. Aimed at addressing safety concerns while retaining the signature versatility and functionality of the Swiss Army Knife, these new blade-free tools are intended to complement the existing multi-tool range, rather than replace it.\n\nVictorinox's CEO, Carl Elsener Jr., explained that the move to blade-free designs reflects changing legislation around knife-related crimes. For example, the British government is contemplating stricter regulations, and some Asian countries view knives more as weapons than tools. This shift in perception is driving Victorinox to create new tools designed for specific activities, like cycling, where blades are not needed, but other multi-tool functions remain essential.\n\nFounded in 1884 by Karl Elsener in Ibach, Switzerland, Victorinox has built a legacy of quality and craftsmanship. The original \"Soldier's Knife,\" produced under contract for the Swiss Army in 1891, was a versatile tool with a blade, a can opener, a screwdriver, and a reamer. This design evolved into the \"Officer's Knife\" in 1897, which added a corkscrew and set the stage for future Swiss Army Knife designs.\n\nVictorinox's distinctive red shield with a white cross became synonymous with the brand in 1909. Following World War II, American soldiers stationed in Europe brought the Swiss Army Knife back to the United States, propelling its popularity among outdoor enthusiasts and adventure seekers.

This particular model features a blade, can opener, screwdriver, blade, wood saw, cap lifter, wire stripper, reamer, and key ring -- all the accoutrements needed to defend Switzerland.\n\nHowever, the sharp-looking pocket knife is about to become a little less sharp.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe knife's manufacturer, Victorinox, is working on a model without a blade -- that is, a 'knife' without an actual knife.\n\nThe increasing safety regulations around the world have prompted the company to make this drastic change.\n\n\"The blade creates a weapon image in some markets,\" company CEO Carl Elsener said in an interview, pointing out that about 80 percent of knives produced by Victorinox are exported.\n\nThis is not the first time that the company has been confronted with the fact that the blade of its pocket knife is seen as a possible weapon.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks in the USA on September 11, 2001, sales of army knives fell by over 30 percent overnight, and the tool was no longer allowed to be carried in hand luggage on board planes.\n\n\"This event showed us that we must not become dependent on a single business area,\" he said.\n\nElsner didn't specify whether all the products will be blade-less, or if some, especially those intended for the Swiss army, will still include the knife.\n\nHe did mention, however, that the company will continue to manufacture 'knives' to be used by non-military personnel, including fishermen, cyclists, hunters, campers, and other outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nThat's because some of the modern knives feature a wide variety of modern attachments for practically all purposes and hobbies, such as fish scaler, metal saw, pliers, chisel, screwdriver, scissors, magnifying glass, pen, can and bottle opener, and tweezers, among dozens others.", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helena_bachmann@thelocal.ch", "name": "Helena Bachmann", "type": "author", "isAgency":

It's like a hair dryer that shoots water. But the business strategy is sound.\n\nThe home page for Swiss Army Knives has a photo of a woman slicing an apple.\n\nHer male companion glances down at the blade. He does not look scared. Why they are using a multipurpose tool while noshing on a cheese board is not clear. Maybe an Alpine marmot broke into their kitchen and looted the utensils. But in the future, this peckish couple may need to buy pre-cut fruit, gruy\u00e8re and salt-cured meats.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBecause in the future, a Swiss Army Knife may have no knife.\n\nAs a spokesperson for Victorinox, the parent company, told CNN this week: \"We are in the early stages of developing pocket tools without blades.\"\n\nWeird, right? It's like hearing about a new TV remote that can't change channels.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt seems there are macro factors pressing down on pocket tools, including an increase in global regulations around knife-carrying. This is especially true in Europe where bans and restrictions target violent criminals who tend to stab more than they shoot.\n\nThe Swiss Army Knife, around since 1897, was designed to be a utility tool. It was never envisioned as a weapon. As Carl Elsener Jr., the company's CEO, told Switzerland's Blick: \"In England or certain Asian countries, you are sometimes only allowed to carry a knife if you need to have it to do your job or operate outdoors. In the city, however, when you go to school, to the cinema, or to go shopping, carrying pocket knives is severely restricted.\"\n\nSo now the company is expanding into the previously unknown segment of bladeless knives. It's like a hair dryer that shoots water. But the business strategy is sound. This is why we can't have nice things -- especially sharp things.\n\nMass-producing a tool that may be prohibited in a growing number of markets makes about as much sense as selling a throw rug that could be deemed a tripping hazard by consumer agencies. But my fear is this shift away from knives will only sharpen Swiss Army's resolve to confuse us with even more specialized tools nobody uses.\n\nThe company is already devoting R&D to cycling and golf. You think there isn't a top-secret department in Ibach now testing gadgets for pickleball or pumpkin spice? Swiss Army Bellybutton De-Linter. It could happen.\n\nI marvel at the design of my Swiss Army Knife. But aside from once using it as a bottle opener during a drunken patio party, I have never deployed the small blade, large blade, screwdriver, wire stripper, sewing awl, tweezers or toothpick. What does that weird hook do? Tighten your shoelaces? My fingers aren't the size of crab claws. What am I supposed to cut with these tiny scissors? The letters from the bottom line of an eye chart?\n\nAs the spokesperson told CNN: \"With innovation at the core of our brand, we are constantly listening to our consumers and their needs; and acknowledge that there is an appetite for the functionality, versatility and craftsmanship the Swiss Army Knife is known for in more specialized fields and situations.\"\n\nSwiss Army? I have needs. Can you invent a Swiss Army Road Rage? When I see another motorist violate a No Left Turn sign, I can roll down my window and push a button on the red device that beams a message: \"YOU CAN'T DO THAT!\"\n\nInstead of having one tool that has like 143 functions, the company should pivot to creating multiple tools that have only one function. Swiss Army Robot Weeder. I chuck it on my lawn and go watch the Jays get pummelled as it crawls around on insect legs, uprooting dandelions and going scorched earth on crab grass.\n\nWait. I know. The Swiss Army GOP Silencer. Every time Marjorie Taylor Greene is about to unleash a crazy rant about Jewish space lasers or Kristi Noem tries to rationalize shooting her puppy in the face, this gizmo turns into earplugs with a UV gaslighting filter.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOr how about the Swiss Army Domestic Bliss? This unit does not have any extendable tools. It just sits in your pocket and listens in case you say the wrong thing. Then it silently vibrates to help you course correct: \"This shrimp pasta tastes like suffering -- vibrate -- I mean, it tastes divine! And this roasted cauliflower is to die for! Honey, I may actually die after one more bite! Excuse me for one sec. I need to find my Swiss Army Defibrillator.\"\n\nA Swiss Army Knife without a blade is like a lamp without a bulb.

It's Wham! without George Michael*. It's Presidentish Joe Biden without his teleprompter. Hell, it might even be Biden with his teleprompter.\n\nIt's a Swiss Army knife... without that bothersome knife part.\n\nSwiss firm Victorinox has made a huge assortment of its iconic pocket knives for more than a century, going all the way back to 1897. Depending on the size, you might find everything from a can opener to a saw to a magnifying glass and even surprisingly sharp little scissors.\n\nThe one thing -- two things, actually -- you could count on finding in the bigger models were a longer blade of almost three inches and a shorter blade an inch or so long.\n\nUntil now. In Britain. That's where Victorinox will soon introduce \"the first range of bladeless products designed specifically for activities where a blade would not be required,\" according to the Guardian. The reason, if you hadn't already guessed, is to combat (\"Word choice!\") \"what an English judge last week called the 'plague of knife crime.'\"\n\nHave they not considered what someone could do with the hole punch found on many of the larger models?\n\nASIDE: I used an AI generator to make the image atop this article, hoping that it would come up with something just as ridiculous as a knifeless pocket knife -- and it delivered.\n\n\"In some markets,\" Carl Elsener, the fourth-generation CEO of Victorinox explained, \"the blade creates an image of a weapon. I have in mind creating a tool that would be useful for cyclists. Cyclists have a need for specific tools but not necessarily a blade,\" he said. \"We already have a tool specifically for golfers.\"\n\nIf you've never owned a Swiss Army knife, you should know that the blades don't lock, so you wouldn't want to try to stab someone with one. Most likely, the blade would fold in, slicing the would-be stabber's fingers right open. But facts hardly matter in the increasingly kindergarten-like, multicultural, and once-great country known as Great Britain.\n\n*You'll earn up to 250 PJ Media Bonus Points\u2122 (no intrinsic value and not redeemable for anything for anything but bragging rights) if you can name the other guy from Wham! without looking it up.\n\nAnd poor Elsener is just bowing to regulatory pressures. The UK has some of the strictest knife-control laws (really!) in the world, and due to that mysterious \"plague of knife crime,\" more laws are sure to come.\n\nBritons, you see, can't be trusted with as much responsibility as 11-year-old VodkaPundit was, way back in the day. My first pocketknife -- a gift at age 11, 44 years ago -- was something close to today's Huntsman model. I used it for everything from whittling to assembling a desk to removing the flashing from model X-Wing parts to first aid.\n\nThat Swiss Army knife taught me how not to cut myself or others, how to care for a blade, and how to get stuff done without asking an adult. In short, it taught me how to be responsible. My sons, ages 13 and 18, have all kinds of knives, and they're coming along quite nicely.\n\nBritain, on the other hand, is being regressed to the status of an unruly 10-year-old who can't yet be trusted with sharp things.\n\nRecommended: Monday's Conspiracy Theory About Joe Biden Is Tuesday's Fact\n\nP.S.

An iconic tool loses its blade", "body": "The iconic tool is surrendering its blade on some models due to the increase in knife-related violence\n\nThere are many models of Swiss Army knives, which can be equipped with everything from a flashlight to a seatbelt cutter. To date though, there's not a version without the tool's namesake knife. That's about to change.\n\nSince the late 1800s pocket-tool maker Victorinox has been manufacturing pocket knives encased in a trademark red outer shell and filled with tools that go well beyond a simple slicer. Now however, due to pressure from rising worldwide knife violence, the company has announced that it will be releasing a version of its product that has no blades.\n\nThat's right, the company is going to be putting out a range of knifeless Swiss army knives.\n\n\"We're concerned about the increasing regulation of knives due to the violence in the world,\" said Carl Elsener, in an interview with The Guardian. Elsner is the fourth-generation CEO of the company, which is still a family-run business. \"In some markets, the blade creates an image of a weapon. I have in mind creating a tool that would be useful for cyclists. Cyclists have a need for specific tools but not necessarily a blade. We already have a tool specifically for golfers.\"\n\nElsner's concern seems to be well founded as, according to the UN's Global Study on Homicide 2023, 30% of all homicides in Europe in 2023 were committed using some type of sharp object.\n\nIn addition to rising knife violence, Victornix told the newspaper that it is also responding to regulations being put into place at various venues and activities such as sporting events or other outdoor activities.\n\nThen, of course, there's the fact that Swiss Army knives regularly get tossed in the confiscation bin at airport security checkpoints. For anyone who's ever lost one of their beloved tools that way, a bladeless version that can still offer up all the other utility would be a welcome addition to their travel toolkit.\n\nWhile the company has been successfully selling multitool knives since 1897, it did see its overall sales slump by 30% after 9/11, says The Guardian, so this move seems to be one intended to read the writing on the wall and head off another hit to the business caused by rising knife violence.\n\nThere's no word yet on when the new bladeless tools will be made available, but with multitools of all stripe regularly blasting past their fundraising goals on crowdfunding platforms, we're sure whatever versions a well-respected maker like Victorinix puts out will fly off the shelves.", "source": {"uri": "newatlas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Atlas"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Army knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocketknife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pocketknife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorinox", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victorinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flashlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seat belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crowdfunding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://assets.newatlas.com/dims4/default/448e542/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewatlas-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2F44%2Fc08f29aa4682a8484a5917ebbc64%2Fscreenshot-2024-05-08-at-7.06.15%E2%80%AFPM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544280", "eventUri": "eng-9544280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

After the terrorist attacks in the USA on September 11, 2001, sales of army knives fell by over 30 percent overnight, according to Elsener.\n\n\"This event showed us that we must not become dependent on a single business area,\" he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Do Swiss soldiers really use the army knife?\n\nIs coronavirus making a comeback in Switzerland?\n\nA new Covid variant, KP.2, has recently been detected, and is currently spreading in the Unites States.\n\nIt appears to have higher transmissibility compared to previous Omicron sub-variants.\n\nThis in itself is not surprising as Covid viruses are constantly evolving and mutating.\n\nHowever, Swiss health officials say that this particular variant has not, to date, been detected in Switzerland.\n\n\"The situation is being monitored closely,\" the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) pointed out, adding that epidemiologists \"consider the risk of a larger wave in the near future to be low. However, a more precise assessment cannot yet be made.\"", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.ch", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helena_bachmann@thelocal.ch", "name": "Helena Bachmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_Switzerland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Banking in Switzerland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Army_knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swiss Army knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocketknife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pocketknife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorinox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victorinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swiss National Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Office of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Knives", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Knives", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Custom_Knives", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Custom Knives", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Knives/Activities", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://apiwp.thelocal.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=webp,width=855,quality=75/https://apiwp.thelocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/watermarks-logo-swiss-army-knife-364232_1280.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544280", "eventUri": "eng-9544280", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-11", "textStart": 1706, "textEnd": 1724}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

A little old lady can defend herself with a gun, but where there are only knives, lowlifes have the advantage.

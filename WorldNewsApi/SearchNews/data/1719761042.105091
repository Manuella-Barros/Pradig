I live Baltimore\u2019s bike lane fiasco, which is just like that! As a resident of Hamilton in Northeast Baltimore, I depend on Harford Road, Route 147, a major road in and out of the city as well as a snow emergency route (\u201cREADER POLL: Bike lanes now extend to many Baltimore neighborhoods. And there are plans for more. Do you support the city\u2019s bike lane effort?\u201d March 14). Bike lanes on Harford Road have reduced the number of drivable lanes from four to two \u2014 although in the last two years, I have not seen one bicyclist using the bike lanes on Harford Road. Hundreds of white \u201csafety\u201d poles on Harford Road promote confusion and frustration for drivers and pedestrians alike. The poles are at most side streets, making it difficult for drivers pulling onto Harford Road. I must squeeze between poles, then make a very sharp turn into the car lane. Both sides of my car have been damaged. Groupings of yellow poles every few blocks in the middle of Harford Road create additional dangerous distractions for drivers. The situation is especially dangerous at night. Together with street lights, business lights, traffic lights and vehicle headlights, the hundreds of reflectors on the white and yellow poles make for treacherous driving. Night and day, emergency vehicles, fire trucks, sanitation, recycling and other large trucks must navigate around the poles along a road where cars cannot easily pull over. I have sat in one lane through three lights with two to three blocks of cars behind me. I have waited through four light changes on the bridge at Harford Road and Chesterfield. I nearly had an accident at Harford Road and 25th Street because, with so many white poles near the intersection, it was difficult to identify the turning lane. This is poor city planning. On Election Day, I spoke to a supporter of a local \u201cprogressive\u201d politician who said Harford Road is \u201csafer with bike lanes\u201d and gave some politically driven statistics. In living 22 years near Harford Road, I have seen very few accidents and no deaths. The \u201cneeded change\u201d she spoke of serves only a select few with a narrow-minded agenda, disregarding the needs of the majority of families in our community. As an \u201cAverage Joe\u201d of Hamilton, I believe the bike lanes just don\u2019t work for most of us. Though it may appear to be safer when we are all driving 15 miles per hour in one lane. \u2014 Nancy Wagner, Baltimore Add your voice: Respond to this piece or other Sun content by submitting your own letter.", "summary": "Slowing traffic on a major Baltimore thoroughfare is nothing short of a nightmare for commuters.", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/05/29/bike-lanes-a-fiasco/", "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/10/21/Y7LRB6G4TZG63J3DACGPHPOOSQ.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:56:13", "author": "Reader Commentary", "authors": ["Reader Commentary"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.082}

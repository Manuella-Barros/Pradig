The missing person case was discussed on the daytime show, with Dermot, Alison Hammond, Vanessa Feltz and Nick Ferrari discussing the situation. Vanessa because emotional as she explained how she knew Michael while Dermot said: \"We can only hope and pray and send our love to all his loved ones that he's found.\" Michael went missing on the island of Symi after leaving St Nicholas Beach to walk back to Pedi on Thursday, with police unsure what may have happened to him. Concerns first arose when the agent of 67-year-old Mosley revealed that the diet book author had not returned from a walk. A comprehensive search operation began on the island of Symi, one of the Dodecanese Islands. A local Facebook group post indicated that a rescue team equipped with drones was due to join from Athens to broaden the search and rescue endeavour. In response to the situation, a Foreign Office spokesperson stated on Thursday: \"We are supporting the family of a British man who is missing in Greece and are in contact with the local authorities.\" An emotional Vanessa said Michael's disappearance was particularly shocking because he is to many the 'embodiment' of good health after spending much of his life trying to help others live longer. She said: \"It's so upsetting, I mean we've all interviewed and met him so many times, and I would say he's kind of like the embodiment of vitality\", Vanessa said, branding Michael Mosley a \"man of irrepressible energy, enthusiasm.\" She added: \"His enthusiasm is for everybody else to feel the same, to be your absolute healthiest, fittest and enjoy life to the fullest, he's the most wonderful person, he walked into the studio and the whole place lit up. I couldn't love the guy more, or admire him more.\" Mosley rose to fame hosting a number of TV shows across various channels, including the Channel 4 programme, Michael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat? He also contributed to the BBC programme, Trust Me, I'm A Doctor, and received an Emmy nomination for the scientific documentary, The Human Face, presented by John Cleese. Away from TV, Mosley is recognised for advocating the 5:2 diet and the Fast 800 diet. Though preferring a private life, it's known that Michael is married to Clare Bailey Mosley, a doctor, author and health columnist in her own right, and they share four children together. Senior Police Spokesman Constantina Dimoglidou said on Thursday: \"He was at the beach of Ag. Nikolas with another couple when he decided to go back to his home in the area of Pedi of Symi. It was around 1.30pm and he forgot his phone at the beach. Any and every attempt to track him down has not produced any result. \"We have now asked the fire brigade to assist in the operation in the case that he may have slipped, tripped, fallen, even bitten by a snake, remaining injured somewhere. There is just no trace of him. None whatsoever and that means that for us at least, every potential scenario is open and being investigated.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads.", "summary": "Michael Mosley, who became a household name with his health advice and dieting tips, has gone missing on the island of Symi", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/dermot-oleary-breaks-silence-missing-32988538", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32988511.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_dermot_main.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:52:41", "author": "Charlotte Everett,Charlotte-Everett", "authors": ["Charlotte Everett", "Charlotte-Everett"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.1}

Bad Boys: Ride or Die turned out to be lethal for a few familiar faces. The fourth installment in Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's long-running Bad Boys franchise brought back multiple characters from previous films in addition to some surprising new additions \u2014 but only some of them made it out alive. Here are all the cameos we caught that popped up during the movie. Michael Bay as \"Porsche Driver\" The original director of Bad Boys and Bad Boys II previously returned to the franchise for a cameo in the third movie, Bad Boys for Life, playing the emcee at the wedding of Marcus' (Lawrence) daughter Megan (Bianca Bethune) and Reggie (Dennis McDonald). Michael Bay's character got on the microphone and introduced Mike (Smith), who got up to make an emotional speech during the reception. But it seems as if the director is playing a different character for his second cameo. In Bad Boys: Ride or Die, he drives by in a Porsche \u2014 seemingly a nod to Smith's iconic pose from the first film that Bay directed \u2014 while Mike and Marcus are walking in the street, and tells them to get out of the road. No one seems to recognize each other as Bay drives by, despite the fact that he was at Marcus' daughter's wedding not too long ago. John Salley as Fletcher Another original Bad Boys player returns in the fourth movie, although this one is a bigger surprise. NBA legend John Salley, who is 6 foot 11, previously appeared in the first movie as the glasses-wearing computer hacker named Fletcher, who got out of prison by lending his expertise to the Miami Police Department. He returned in Bad Boys II but sat out of 2020's third movie. He's back for Bad Boys: Ride or Die, and this time, Fletcher has gone legit. He's even guarding an important piece of intel left by the late Capt. Howard (Joe Pantoliano) for Mike and Marcus, which helps them crack their case. Unfortunately, no good deed goes unpunished, and Fletcher gets a bullet to the brain for his efforts. Want more movie news?

DJ Khaled as Manny After making his Bad Boys debut in the third movie, DJ Khaled is back again for the fourth. He reprises his role as Manny the Butcher, who used to be Mike's confidential informant. In the last movie, he swore that he'd finally left his criminal life in the past, but everyone has a price. In Bad Boys: Ride or Die, Mike and Marcus get a bounty of $5 million put on their heads as a result of investigating the corruption conspiracy posthumously implicating Capt. Howard. That bounty is enough to lure Manny back to the dark side. He attacks Mike and Marcus alongside a whole crowd of eager gang members looking to earn that large prize, but Manny dies immediately in the skirmish after Mike, Marcus, and Mike's son Armando (Jacob Scipio) drive a van right into him. Karma got him pretty quickly. Joyner Lucas as a gang leader A new face joining the Bad Boys franchise is Joyner Lucas. The rapper shows up as a gang leader in the same fight scene as Manny the Butcher, attacking Mike, Marcus, and Armando. However, he falls short of collecting the $5 million bounty after the trio gets away. Khaby Lame as ... a guy who shrugs This is more of a blink-and-you'll-miss-it-if-you-don't-know-to-look-for-it kind of cameo, but social media personality Khaby Lame, who went viral for his signature shrug, also appears in the movie not long after Bay makes his appearance. And he does what he does best: shrugs. The cameo comes after Lame helped out with the movie's promotion, filming a short video with Lawrence and Smith, which he shared with his 162.5 million TikTok followers. Jay Shetty as a wedding officiant Also in the mix is author and self-help guru to the stars, Jay Shetty. As he did in real life for Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's nuptials, the life coach officiates the wedding between Mike and Christine (Melanie Liburd) that kicks off the movie.", "summary": "From original director Michael Bay to former basketball star John Salley, here are the familiar faces who pop up during the fourth &#34;Bad Boys&#34; movie.", "url": "https://ew.com/all-cameos-bad-boys-ride-or-die-michael-bay-john-salley-dj-khaled-more-8659840", "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/vGLf8xoHCwu9LWMOnikEqoOZxzI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Michael-Bay-060624-6d2f124b125441f0a2d2684dd5083759.jpg", "video": "https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/V1wBki63-GQ0UtFMY.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:00:00", "author": "Sydney Bucksbaum", "authors": ["Sydney Bucksbaum"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.179}

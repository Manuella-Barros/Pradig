Motorists breaching the guidance have been warned to expect huge fines amid the ongoing Cost of Living crisis. Motorists are deliberately ignoring the \u201ctwo second gap\u201d rule with a survey by the AA finding that cases of tailgating have gotten worse in the UK Tim Rankin, managing director of AA Accident Assist, warned drivers also need a more visible police presence to keep those \u201cwilling to misbehave in check\u201d. He said: \u201cAs we head into summer, we encourage drivers to allow more space between themselves and other vehicles. Creating at least a two-second gap can help prevent crashes but could also reduce outbursts of road rage.\u201d National Highways, meanwhile, said: \"We associate tailgating with aggressive, 'own the road' speed-merchants, trying to intimidate other drivers to get out of their way. The Highway Code says you should \u201callow at least a two second gap between you and the vehicle in front on roads carrying faster moving traffic\u201d.\" National Highways Head of Road Safety, Jeremy Phillips, said: \"Unfortunately, as highlighted by the M1 trial, we know that too many people are driving too close on our roads. Most tailgating is unintentional by drivers who don\u2019t realise that they are infringing on someone else\u2019s space. \"But not leaving enough space between you and the vehicle in front is not only very frightening for that driver, it could have devastating consequences. The closer you get, the less time you have to react and to stop safely. \"So to avoid inadvertently getting too close to the vehicle in front, we would urge drivers to use the two-second rule and to always \u2018stay safe, stay back\u2019.\" The gap should be wider as speeds increase. It rises to 2.4 seconds \u2013 about 53 metres \u2013 when driving at 50mph and 3.1 seconds \u2013 or 96 metres \u2013 at 70mph.", "summary": "Motorists breaching the guidance have been warned to expect huge fines amid the ongoing Cost of Living crisis.", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/millions-drivers-risk-fines-after-29257836", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29257853.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_motorway.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:22:27", "author": "James Rodger", "authors": ["James Rodger"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.74}

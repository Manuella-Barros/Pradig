Gretchen Whitmer gives 4 pieces of advice to Trump and Vance ahead of Michigan rally", "body": "Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) on ABC's Good Morning America in July 2024 (Image: Screengrab via Good Morning America / YouTube)\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) are scheduled to hold their first rally as the official GOP nominees for president and vice president, respectively, in Michigan on Saturday. The Mitten State's top Democrat just posted a welcome video for the two Republicans ahead of their visit in which she offered four pieces of advice.\n\nIn a video posted to X (formerly Twitter), Governor Gretchen Whitmer -- who is currently serving her second term in office -- said Trump and Vance \"need to know\" a few things about her state's voters before speaking to them.\n\n\"Welcome to Michigan, Donald Trump and JD Vance!\" Whitmer said with a smile and wearing a t-shirt that reads \"4 out of 5 Great Lakes prefer Michigan\" (which borders four of the give Great Lakes). \"Here are three things you should know about our great state.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Whitmer: Trump is 'convicted felon' who wants to win White House 'to go after his enemies'\n\n\"One: Here, we protect reproductive freedom,\" she continued. \"We're not interested in your national abortion ban.\"\n\n\"Two: We always find ways to put money back in Michiganders' pockets by lowering the cost of prescription drugs, education and so much more,\" she added. \"And three: We're a proud union state, and UAW [United Auto Workers] workers here still remember when Donald Trump broke his promises to Michigan workers.\"\n\nShe then imparted a fourth piece of advice for the 2024 Republican ticket.\n\n\"Oh, and one more thing: Michigan is gonna reject your extreme Project 2025 agenda,\" she said. \"Have a good trip!\"\n\nREAD MORE: Chuck Todd calls Michigan 'more volatile' than other states ahead of presidential election\n\nThe Michigan governor's video message to Trump and Vance is particularly significant, given the Mitten State's status as a must-win battleground state for both Democrats and Republicans this November. President Joe Biden's clearest path to victory requires him winning Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin this fall, and securing 270 electoral votes becomes much more difficult if Michigan breaks for Trump.\n\nWhitmer's statement about Trump breaking his promise to Michigan workers could be a reference to when he spoke at a non-union shop in Michigan while UAW workers were on a nationwide strike that successfully resulted in a favorable new contract for members. Meanwhile, Biden was the first sitting president to ever join a picket line when he joined striking UAW workers in Michigan last year.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Lakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Todd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Todd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Feminism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Feminism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Technical_Assistance_Programs", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Technical Assistance Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=52954839&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C97%2C0%2C103", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749711", "eventUri": "eng-9749711", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It's easy to see why many Democrats believe Whitmer, who recently said that it would not hurt for President Biden to take a cognitive test, would be a more competitive candidate than Biden. A deep dive into Whitmer's accomplishments as governor, however, turns up a record that could be difficult to defend outside of blue states.\n\nProminent policy changes enacted by Governor Whitmer -- such as the undoing of an income tax cut enacted by her predecessor and repeal of Right-to-Work so that Michigan workers can once again be forced to join a union as a condition of employment -- will be viewed as major victories by top Democratic Party donors, but will prove unpopular with voters in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, and other 2024 battleground states that will determine whether Democrats maintain control of the White House and U.S. Senate. What's more, though Whitmer was able to survive the blowback against the draconian lockdowns that she mandated during the pandemic but was herself caught skirting, a national electorate is unlikely to be as forgiving.\n\nThe major policy changes implemented by Governor Whitmer, particularly since Democrats took control of the Michigan House and Senate in 2022, will be unpopular in Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and other presidential battleground states. In addition to being difficult sell to independent voters and swing state electorates, Whitmer's record will provide ample fodder for Republican ad makers.\n\nTake the controversial decision by Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) to undo a legislatively enacted income tax cut that was signed into law by Whitmer's predecessor, Rick Snyder. Income tax cuts have been enacted in more than half of the states over the last four years. At a time when most states, even blue states, are cutting income taxes, this move backed by Governor Whitmer to ratchet the rate back up made Michigan an outlier.\n\nGovernor Whitmer and Attorney General Nessel turned to a novel legal theory to repeal the tax relief enacted by her predecessor and a majority of the state legislature, all of whom believed they were implementing permanent rate reduction so long as revenue triggers were met. Those revenue triggers were met and as a result Michigan's income tax rate was reduced last year from 4.25% to 4.05%. Now, even though the legislation enacting that tax cut doesn't stipulate as much, Governor Whitmer and Attorney General Nessel claim that the rate must snap back to 4.25%.\n\nDue to a lawsuit challenging that decision, the Michigan Supreme Court will have the final say as to whether this income tax cut is temporary or permanent. Whitmer's decision to back the administrative imposition of an income tax hike not called for by law will be popular with many coastal donors and progressive activists. Such a maneuver, however, is unlikely to go over as well with swing voters in Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and other battleground states.\n\nAnother progressive accomplishment that will play well with key Democratic constituencies but could harm Governor Whitmer's standing with swing state voters is her repeal of Michigan's Right-to-Work law, which protected workers from being forced to join and pay dues to a union as a condition of employment. As with Whitmer's push for a higher state income tax rate, her repeal of Right-to-Work is another area where Michigan serves as an outlier. While Right-to-Work was enacted in five states over the past decade, only in Michigan has it been repealed.\n\nEven with its repeal in Michigan, the number of Right-to-Work states has grown over the past decade by more than 18%. Most states, 26 after the repeal in Michigan, now have a Right-to-Work law on the books. What's more, the states with the fastest growing populations are all Right-to-Work states, while the states experiencing the greatest population loss due to domestic outmigration are non-Right-to-Work states.\n\nAside from population growth, Right-to-Work states outperform non-Right-to-Work states in job creation, income growth, and GDP growth. As with her income tax hike, even though repeal of Right-to-Work is another accolade that will help Whitmer curry favor with powerful Democratic Party insiders, it will likely make her less appealing to many swing state voters.\n\n\"Nothing is more demonstrative of Governor Whitmer's flippant and inexperienced approach to fostering economic growth than her repeal of Right to Work, raising the income tax, and repealing education accountability laws,\" says Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R). \"It's no surprise that she now needs to bribe companies with billions in corporate handouts just to get them to even look at investing here. It's been a complete failure.\"\n\nAside from controversial policy changes she has enacted, Whitmer's skirting of her own pandemic lockdown orders would likely show up in Republican ads should Democrats find a way to swap her onto the top of the ticket. In her new book, True Gretch, Whitmer recounts how she, like California Governor Gavin Newsom (D), was caught shirking the business lockdowns that she imposed on her constituents during the pandemic. Whitmer stipulates, however, that Newsom violated his own lockdown rules in order to dine at a Michelin starred restaurant, whereas she was caught in a dive bar.\n\nAs Governor Whitmer hits the road for her book tour, she will find receptive audiences in the places she is visiting outside of Michigan, which include Seattle, Los Angeles, Martha's Vineyard, and Washington, D.C. Though Whitmer's book tour is scheduled to visit only blue states thus far, further tour dates will soon be announced for later this summer and fall. Governor Whitmer will find many cities and towns throughout red states -- such as Austin, Atlanta, Asheville, Charleston, and Nashville -- where her book will sell well. Her record as governor, however, will be a tougher sale to the statewide electorates in those places should she become a national candidate, be that in 2024 or a future election.", "source": {"uri":

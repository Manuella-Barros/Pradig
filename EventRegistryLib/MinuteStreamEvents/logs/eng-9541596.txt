But unlike Colter, who is determined to get to the bottom of what really went down with their father more than 20 years ago -- what's this about Ashton having been a government contractor? -- Dory is determined to leave the past behind her and get on with her life. It's what she's been trying to do ever since Dad died and she went to live with her Uncle Dave and Aunt Melissa, while Colter stayed back to take care of their mother, Mary.\n\nDuring the hour, we discovered that Dory is still in touch with her other brother, Russell -- who, as we know, Colter believes murdered their father in 2003. We also learned that Dory doesn't trust Mary's version of the truth.\n\nColter's reunion with Dory will be followed by an even more tense reunion with Russell, who will be played by Supernatural's Jensen Ackles and first seen in Episode 12 (airing Sunday, May 12). Below, Roxburgh weighs in on Dory's debut, her respective relationships with Colter, Russell and Mary, and her hopes for appearing alongside both Justin Hartley and Jensen Ackles in Season 2.\n\nTVLINE | The audience at this point knows quite a bit about the Shaw family and what happened with Dad. How much did Melissa know about all this family drama?\n\nI'd seen part of the show already, so I knew that it was a complicated family dynamic, but I got a little bit more context in where things were at coming onto the show -- not only where Dory was at, but where Colter and Russell and Mom were at, and where things kind of stood. I definitely came into a very complicated dynamic and I'm excited to see how it all unravels.\n\nTVLINE | Throughout this episode, Dory is pleading with Colter to move on and forget about the past. She insists that she has let go of all this family baggage. But do you really think that Dory has moved on? Or has she just done a better job of not letting it consume her the way that it consumes Colter?\n\nI think she has definitely done a better job. Despite how she talks in the episode, there's definitely a part of her that needs to know the truth [about Mom and Dad] just as much, but she knows that if she pulls the thread that it will all unravel, and she doesn't know what is going to be behind the curtain. I think her hope is to have everyone move on. She seems to be a very logical person, especially with her career and whatnot, but deep down she knows that it's more complicated than that.\n\nTVLINE | Dory says that she is nothing like her parents. But as Colter points out, Dory is a professor, just like Ashton and Mary. Do you get the sense that, even though Dory was pretty young when everything went to hell, that she looked up to Mom and Dad at a certain point in her life?\n\nWhat she's doing with her life now is maybe what she had hoped her parents had done. Because I think that there is a respect for the academia aspect of her family, and she is just trying to do right in her own life. She admires a lot of what she was taught growing up, but....\n\nTVLINE | But Dory has found a more practical way to apply some of the stuff that Dad taught them?\n\nYeah.\n\nTVLINE | When Colter and Dory are first reunited, Dory seems really excited to see her big brother despite the fact that he's ghosted her for the past year. Why do you think she's able to let go of that anger so quickly and embrace her brother being back in her life?\n\nShe knows that he has always been like this. Their family is not normal, especially how they were raised. There's an understanding about the trauma that he's been through as well. I don't think Dory is a judgmental person at all; she really just wants what is best for her two brothers. When Colter does show up, it's like the prodigal son kind of thing. She's just happy that he's back, but then she realizes [later in the episode] that he's not really back. That's almost what upsets her more: that he isn't even showing up with the right intentions. That's what hurts her the most.\n\nTVLINE | Dory confronts Colter at dinner about accepting Mary's version of the truth at face value. It's pretty evident at this point that Dory does not trust Mom. Do you have a sense of whether Dory and Mary are on speaking terms?\n\nI would guess not. Dory is pretty smart, and I think that she clocks a lot of what her mother is doing. She knows that there is way more to the story [about Dad] than Mom has let on, for whatever reason. For Dory, trying to have a healthy life at this point means maybe not being close to Mom.\n\nTVLINE | We learn that Dory is still in touch with Russell. Do you know anything more about that relationship? Perhaps Justin or one of the other producers looped you in?\n\nI gathered that Dory and Russell are definitely closer than Dory and Colter, but we'll see how that changes as Dory is more involved in the show, especially with Russell coming back as well. I'm curious to see what happens there. I'm excited to see how the dynamics shift.\n\nTVLINE | It was announced a little less than two weeks after your casting was confirmed that Jensen Ackles had been tapped to play Russell. Were you aware when you were filming your episode that Jensen was attached?\n\nYeah, Justin told me. I'm so excited because one of my first jobs was with Jensen [on Supernatural]. I think it was my second job ever, actually. I was so green and so new, and it would be nice to play with him again.\n\nTVLINE | I feel like the audience is owed a scene, or perhaps an entire episode, where we get Colter, Russell, Dory and Mary in one room....\n\nI want that! I want to know what happens!\n\nTVLINE | I'm just saying, that would make for a pretty epic Thanksgiving episode in Season 2.\n\nIt would definitely be a dramatic one.\n\nTVLINE | On Tracker, Colter has mastered the art of tracking someone down -- typically within a few days, sometimes within a matter of hours. Now, you were on a show, Manifest, where a plane full of passengers disappeared for five years...\n\nCorrect...\n\nTVLINE | Now, let's imagine that Colter Shaw existed in the Manifest universe. Do you think he would have stood a chance at finding that plane sooner?\n\nOh, my word!

In the episode \"Beyond the Campus Walls,\" a grad student goes missing, and Colter consults Dory, a professor at the college, to get more intel. It's revealed that the two haven't talked too much in the past year. Not only that, but when they try to set up a dinner, Colter flakes and Dory isn't so surprised, more just disappointed.\n\nWhile they do eventually have dinner together, they vent a lot about what went wrong in their family and why. At one point, Dory said, \"I just want my brothers back.\" Jensen Ackles will be appearing in next week's episode as their brother Russell, meaning that we will be seeing more complicated Shaw sibling dynamics. As for whether fans could look forward to seeing all three of them on-screen together, Roxburgh admitted she's \"curious about the story too. I really want to see what happened and where it goes.\"\n\n\"And so Jensen, I did an episode of Supernatural at the very beginning of my career,\" Roxburgh shared. \"So I would love to be in the same room as both of them, and I'm sure it'll happen at some point. But yeah, on one hand, I have a friend that I'm working with and then someone that I worked in the past. I think it's just so funny how life works that way.\"\n\n\"I don't know how exactly they'll rebuild everything, but I have a sneaking suspicion, or hope, I guess, that they form a little trio and they solve something together,\" she continued. \"And Dory would be the research one, of course. She wouldn't necessarily be out there in the field, but she'd be the one helping them figure stuff out and leave behind the computer, because she's the professor one. So she would be the knowledge, and she would be able to help them in that capacity, which I think could be super fun.\"\n\nThe explanation as to why their relationship is so complex stems from their dad dying and beyond. Colter gave Dory files on their father, and during dinner, they relived the past, going over what happened when he died: Dory took the first chance she had to leave while Colter stayed behind to help their mother, and Russell? He was nowhere. Even though there are a lot of unresolved issues between the family, Melissa Roxburgh thinks it will eventually get resolved.\n\n\"But obviously, as TV goes, you need a little drama first,\" Roxburgh said. \"So I think that she carries a lot of guilt about leaving, but also knowing that it was the right thing for her to do. So I think that she's caught in this place of she's built this life for herself that she's really, really proud of, but she just wants Colter to be in the same place as her, and she wants him to be healthy, and happy, and she's not sure if he is. And she gets to learn a little bit more about him by seeing what he does in this episode. I think that she has this whole idea of what his life is like, and she feels bad for him and then sees that he's actually doing good work out there, and she gained a bit of respect for what he does.\"\n\nSince Tracker has been renewed for Season 2, and there is still a lot to explore with Dory and the Shaw siblings, could this mean that Roxburgh would be down to return? \"Of course,\" she shared. \"I think there are some talks. I'm not too sure how in progress they are, but I would absolutely be so, so excited to come back and play.\"\n\nTracker will be part of CBS' 2024 fall schedule, so hopefully, it won't be long until fans see Dr. Dory Shaw again. In the meantime, they will just have to look forward to how Colter handles Russell because, from the sounds of it already, things are even more complicated with those two. New episodes of Tracker air on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on CBS. The Season 1 finale airs on Sunday, May 19.\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Paramount_Global", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of assets owned by Paramount Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roxburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roxburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Ackles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Roxburgh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Roxburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/05/03/eb543bcf-6dd8-4915-ae66-f1d3a8983434/tracker-melissa-roxburgh-justin-hartley-cbs.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541596", "eventUri": "eng-9541596", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 3952, "textEnd": 3958}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Still, from the sounds of things, everyone's ho-hum attitude about Blake's disappearance was annoying in the beginning.\n\nObviously, as viewers, we knew something was wrong. But a young student who's never fallen off the grid while leaving their phone behind? That sounds like something that shouldn't be swept under the rug.\n\nThe more we learned about Blake, the more obvious it became that whatever happened to him had to do with the research he was doing. I liked that they immediately mentioned Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes to put things into perspective.\n\nBlake was working on a major, potentially groundbreaking project that would stand to make substantial amounts of money down the line.\n\nSo, yes. Perhaps he could have felt the pressure of the project and removed himself for a few days to decompress, or maybe with the amount of potential money surrounding this project, something bad happened to him.\n\nColter always relies on his team to help him figure certain things out, and without Bobby, it would have taken him forever to connect the dots.\n\nOnce Bobby got into Blake's messages, what started to surface was something I didn't see coming, and there was no way Colter did either.\n\nRelated: How Tracker Can Avoid Common Procedural Pitfalls\n\nCatfishing is a term that's become mainstream after the success of both the film and television series of the same name that caught people pretending to be someone else as a means to manipulate them for money, attention, both, or any number of things.\n\nThere's never been a rulebook for catfishing. Still, Colter sniffed out what was potentially happening with a quickness, especially considering the lengths the person Blake was taking to protect their identity.\n\nAlthough, most catfishers are choosing someone else's pictures and life to hide behind, but for story purposes, that wasn't going to work here.\n\nWhen Hewitt told Colter that he revoked Blake's lab privileges, Colter may have believed the man because he had no reason not to, but I've watched enough television to know that immediately trying to smear the character of a missing or deceased person is a red flag.\n\nHewitt was hiding something; that much was clear, but once Irene started talking about the dark web and revenge porn, I was no longer sure how Hewitt fit into things because going to the dark web? Would a Biochemistry professor even know how to do that?\n\nAs it turns out, no. He wouldn't.\n\nColter puts himself into these surreal situations sometimes, and waltzing into Irene's business, emptying the bullets from her gun, and getting her to turn on her husband all within the span of a conversation is something only he can do.\n\nRelated: CBS Towers Over the Competition in Billions of Minutes Watched\n\nIrene wasn't an innocent bystander in what happened. She could have called the cops any number of times after her husband disappeared. And who knows what other shameful stuff she participated in.\n\nBut Colter appealed to her guilt, something he's good at, and his little plan to contact the client was smart. And finding out Dax was involved made everything click.\n\nHewitt didn't know how the hell to get on the dark web and hire con people to get leverage against someone, but Dax did.\n\nDax was a little too aggressive when Colter stopped by the lab to ask him and Jada about Blake, and maybe you could chalk it up to a rivalry between determined, and hardworking scientists, but seeing him in that hoodie made everything make sense.\n\nIt was wild of him to say things were getting out of hand when he helped his COLLEGE PROFESSOR get access to the dark web. Um, you think maybe things have gotten a little too deep there, Dax?\n\nLike I said earlier about red flags, finding out Hewitt was the one falsifying data, like, you guessed it, Elizabeth Holmes back in the day, connected all the dots.\n\nAnd it's just like Tracker to take a complicated route to reach a simpler conclusion.\n\nDesperate people do desperate things, and Hewitt was as desperate as they come while also being cowardly and idiotic at the same time.\n\nWhat exactly did he think would happen at the end of this? Was he expecting Blake to hand over the flash drive, then he would just be able to let him go with the threat of his nudes leaking, and everything would be all good?\n\nNot to mention Blake was fully aware of Chuck and Irene, and what did Hewitt think would happen there? They'd be cool knowing he was out there and could blow their lives to smithereens with a phone call?\n\nA bumbling bad guy was what Hewitt was, but I saw him shooting Chuck coming from a mile away. It was obvious he didn't want Blake dead, but once Colter busted through, he was literally backed into a corner.\n\nThey always have Colter in these badass final confrontations, with some crazier than others. Shotting through the floorboards during Tracker Season 1 Episode 10 comes to mind first.\n\nThis one wasn't on that level, but only Colter could snap his head around a corner and clip someone in the shoulder before they knew what hit them.\n\nYes, Hewitt was a bumbling professor, but Colter made something incredibly dangerous look easy.\n\nAnother successful case under Colter's belt, and this one he wouldn't have cracked with his usual teams, and also Dory, would was the key to even finding Blake's physical location.\n\nDory Shaw seems sweet, if not a little prickly around the edges, just like her brother. The flashbacks haven't done much for her character, so heading into this hour, it was unclear where she stood with the family dynamics.\n\nWe knew Colter and his mama weren't Russell fans, but what about her?\n\nFinding out she was still in contact with Russell caught Colter off guard, making you wonder what those years were like right after Papa Shaw died.\n\nWell, now we know everyone went their separate ways, with Colter being the only one to stay back with his mother, and that tracks when you see how protective he is of her.\n\nThere's something off about Mary Dove, as many noticed during Tracker Season 1 Episode 2. Dory was quick to throw shade at her mom whenever Colter brought her up, which was noteworthy.\n\nWithout knowing all the context, Ashton was the one Colter associates a lot of his traumatic childhood to, with the flashbacks we've seen through his eyes focused on his father's actions.\n\nBut what about Mary? She was also there, and to have Colter tell it doesn't seem like she was involved much. But maybe he's cherry-picking memories, or that time when it was just him and his mother, diluted some of what was true about that time for him.\n\nIf Colter and his mother were all each other, then it's understandable how much faith and trust he would put into her. She was his lifeline, and they were there for each other through major grief and change.\n\nIt's interesting, though, that one conversation with his sister has him suddenly questioning such a major relationship in his life. However, it's not like Dory is some random person he met on a call never to be seen again.\n\nDory: I talked to Russell, by the way. He says you've been ducking him.\n\nColter: You talked to Russell?\n\nDory: Yeah. Some. We keep in touch. You should talk to him.\n\nColter: I don't have anything to say to Russell.\n\nDory: Fine, do it your way. You always do.\n\nDory claimed to have moved on, but if anything, it felt like that was still a work in progress.\n\nMary Dove potentially hiding secrets wasn't a shock, but seeing how deeply Dory distrusted her was an intriguing new piece.\n\nIf the answers Colter's been seeking his whole life were right under his nose the whole time, and his mother could have helped him somehow get closure? That will be a devastating reveal for a guy who prides himself on being level-headed in all situations.\n\nRelated: Jensen Ackles's Inspired Tracker Casting Gives Us Goosebumps\n\nWhatever happens next, the mysteries of the Shaw family only went up in intrigue factor, and knowing Russell is poised to make an appearance next week only ups that factor even more.\n\nLet's crack this Shaw Family drama even more and get Colter some much-needed answers!\n\nTracker Notes\n\nThis was a well-balanced and great installment, focusing on an interesting case and Colter's personal life.\n\nLet me know in the comments below how you felt about the hour, and remember you can catch up on all the Tracker reviews as we head into the final episodes.", "source": {"uri": "tvfanatic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Fanatic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "whitney_evans@tvfanatic.com", "name": "Whitney Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hewitt_(herpetologist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Hewitt (herpetologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracker_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tracker (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dax,_Landes", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dax, Landes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dax, Landes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catfishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theranos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subplot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subplot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walking Dead (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billions (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jada_Pinkett_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jada Pinkett Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_porn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenge porn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biochemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goosebumps (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://tv-fanatic-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--bdj2CnWw--/t_full/cs_srgb,d_tv-fanatic-placeholder-square.png,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1687871877/slideshows/new-characters-worth-their-weight-in-gold.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541596", "eventUri": "eng-9541596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

After four seasons playing younger sister to former Prince Charming Josh Dallas on Manifest, she's now appearing on Tracker as Dory, the younger sister of Colter Shaw, played by Justin Hartley. And later this month, Supernatural star Jensen Ackles will make his debut as Colter and Dory's estranged older brother Russell.\n\n\"I only do attractive brothers. I don't work with the ugly ones,\" Roxburgh joked to Parade. \"I actually got a message from Josh and he was like, 'You traitor!' So yeah, I've played a lot of brother/sister dynamics.\"\n\nColter and Dory haven't seen each other in quite a while, mostly due to the family secrets and painful baggage that have plagued Colter all season. They reunite this week as a case brings Colter to a university where Dory teaches physics to chase down a missing kid, and it gives the siblings the chance to see each other in action and begin to work through the mess their survivalist parents created.\n\nRead on to hear Roxburgh's take on her character and what it was like to reunite with pal Justin Hartley.\n\nRelated: 'Tracker' Guest Star Sofia Pernas Teases 'Sexually Fraught' Scenes With Husband Justin Hartley\n\nTell me about joining this show and this messed up family.\n\nRoxburgh: So I came onto this show only really knowing, when I first heard about it, that I was playing the sister. So for more information to come out about who she was and the backstory of this family and all that stuff was super interesting. Obviously I'd watched the first couple episodes of the show, and it was a really complicated story that I was excited to dive into. And seeing Dory as an adult, a professor with her life together, she's such a cool, complicated character. She's trying so hard to be normal, but the family is not normal. So I'm curious to see how she unravels as things start to happen.\n\nHow did you go about playing someone who's so professional on the outside, but actually so screwed up?\n\nI think everyone deals with trauma in different ways, and the way she's dealt with it is just by plugging along and pretending stuff hasn't happened. Or maybe pretending is the wrong word. I think she just knows that if she pulls the threads, she's not sure what's gonna come out of it and she doesn't think it will be helpful or healthy to anyone to go down that path, but I have a sneaking suspicion that she's going to have to go down that path.\n\nMuch of the ongoing story of the show is about revealing this family's history, so did you get any insight into that outside of the script?\n\nYeah, I had some conversations with [director] Ken Olin and Justin, so I got a bit of context. But for me as an actor, I have just as many question marks as Dory does about what happened and what the truth of it is.\n\nIt does feel like she doesn't hesitate when Colter needs her help, regardless of what's gone on between them.\n\nThey were raised in such a unique way that I don't think that will ever leave any of the siblings. So even though she's got this academic job now, I think there's definitely a part of her that still you know...they grew up watching their parents teach them how to kill animals and all that stuff. So there's this hunter aspect of her as well, and this desire to figure out the truth and this desire to help her brother, at the very least, with what he's doing.\n\nWhat was it like establishing that brother/sister relationship with Justin?\n\nBecause he and I know each other so well, it was easy to just put that on screen. In real life, he's definitely like a big brother to me, so playing the logical, rational sibling...it's more the opposite. He's definitely given me a lot of life advice in real life.\n\nHow does this episode change things between Dory and Colter? Does she think he could live a \"normal life\" like her?\n\nI think she hoped, but she quickly realizes that it's not the path that he chose, and he'll keep doing what he feels he needs to do in life. I think she does gain a bit of respect for him in watching what he does by the end of the episode. She thinks that he was just like tracking down puppies, but then she realizes that it's a lot more serious, which scares her, but she's also like, oh, okay, you're doing proper work out there. I mean, obviously it's not what anyone would want for their brother. It's dangerous. But I think she kind of takes on this mentality of well, if I can't change your mind, at least I'll help you.\n\nRelated: Jon Huertas Shares Secret to 'This Is Us' Family Ahead of 'Tracker' Reunion With Justin Hartley\n\nWhat's it like jumping into a show like this one after so many years in a world like Manifest?\n\nIt's nice, you know. I mean, Michaela wound up being pretty strong in the end. She started off a hot mess, and Dory seems like she's got her stuff together but may become a hot mess with whatever comes out about the family. We'll see.

The Shaw family's past is shrouded in mystery, with unanswered questions and a sketchy father figure. New episodes of Tracker air on CBS, with Colter Shaw uncovering secrets and reuniting with family members.\n\nAfter a couple of episodes, it became abundantly clear that the Shaw family in CBS' hit series Tracker, were anything but normal. Besides their family home being located deep in the Sierra National Forest, and one Shaw, Colter (Justin Hartley) abhoring the idea of putting down roots by living in the back of a trailer. There was always simmering tension anytime Colter's relationship with his elder brother, Russell. came up. Supernatural's Jensen Ackles has been cast to portray the estranged big brother and the pair are about to reunite in the show's upcoming episode as revealed in a new promotional video.\n\nRussell and Colter's reunion had been teased by series lead, Hartley, as being a tense occassion and he certainly wasn't wrong. The new clip features Colter observing a truck pull up to his trailer at the dead of night. Without hesistation or second thought, the survivalist draws his firearm and steps out to confront the unexpected guest. However, upon emerging from his trailer, finds his older brother staring right back at him. \"Hey little brother,\" Ackles' Russell says. It's a short but instructive clip of what is to come next. Colter obviously wasn't expecting him, however, given that he had dodged all of Russell's calls and messages all season, it made sense for his big brother to track him down if the situation was dire.\n\nThere are many loopholes and unanswered questions regarding the Shaw family. Those questions stem mainly from the circumstance under which Berkeley professors, Ashton (Lee Tergesen) and Mary Shaw (Wendy Crewson) left there jobs and relocated their young family into the woods. What came after was an unconventional childhood, a paranoid father and the sketchy death of said father wherein his oldest son is implicated - somehow.\n\nThere Are More Divisions in the Shaw Family\n\nRecent episodes of Tracker have seen a lot of reunions, a theme that is set to continue into the series finale. The show's most recent episode sees Colter reunite with his young sister, Dory (Melissa Roxburgh) after going MIA on her for a year. While the pair might have reconnected, while seeking to maybe unravel the secrets of their late father's life. The episode also exposed that of the living Shaws, Russell and Colter aren't the only ones who don't see eye to eye. During the episode, Dory questioned why Colter has been quick to accept their mom's version of events. Speaking about the mother-daughter dynamic on the show, Roxburgh reveals that the pair are possibly not on speaking terms. \"Dory is pretty smart, and I think that she clocks a lot of what her mother is doing. She knows that there is way more to the story [about Dad] than Mom has let on, for whatever reason. For Dory, trying to have a healthy life at this point means maybe not being close to Mom,\" Roxburgh explained.\n\nNew episodes of Tracker air on CBS on Sundays.

If you recall, Dory was featured in a flashback during the Tracker series premiere, so this is the first time fans are catching up with her in Colter's modern day story. Of course, this episode will also likely set the stage for the arrival of their older brother, Russell Shaw, in the penultimate episode. Below, you can check out the full, spoiler-filled recap of Tracker's new episode.\n\nColter kicks off the episode in Wyoming, looking for a missing college student named Blake. The first scene shows Blake at a party mistakenly grabbing the arm of a girl he thought was someone else, and getting beaten up by her boyfriend tor it. Blake's Mom works at the school and says she hasn't worried about him and that he left his phone behind when he disappeared. According to her, Blake had been under pressure from his anxiety and his biochemistry grant project. After a little more prodding from Colter, Blake's mom reveals that her brother had a psychotic break and schizophrenic episode when he was the same age as Blake, and she worries there may be something similar going on.\n\nColter pops into of the classrooms on the Wyoming Science campus where his sister is giving a lecture on thermodynamics. She reveals they haven't spoken in a year, and that he hasn't returned any of her calls. That said, they're both clearly on good terms with one another. He shares the folder about their dad that he found one while investigating a cult earlier in the season. One part of the file reveals that their dad was employed by the government for seven years, and that's something their mom never told them. She reveals she recently talked to Russell and that he's been wanting to get in touch with Colter.\n\nColter heads to the lab where Blake worked to get some more information about his grant project and the people he interacted with most. The scientists in the lab seems to have a disagreement on what happened to Blake. One thinks he bailed while another doesn't think he would abandon the work like that. The professor tells Colter that they had a difficult conversation about Blake falsifying data. The conversation resulted in Blake getting his lab access revoked. The professor also explains that everything has to be under intense scrutiny because there could be a lot of money involved after things expand. Colter pulls aside the student that backed Blake up and she says she saw Blake drunk on the other side of town two nights before. She said it was strange that he was out at a party, because that's not usually his scene. Bobby digs up some information from Blake's phone and social records, showing a lot of communications and files being sent between Blake and somebody else.\n\nInvestigating the location of the party where Blake was last scene, Colter breaks into a quiet house and searches through its empty rooms. In the very back room he finds a bed with restraints attached to it, a closet full of cameras and BDSM props, and an iPad with pictures of Blake. Bobby cracked the accounts and figured out Blake had been talking a lot to someone with the alias \"BlondieBaby.\" She was supposed to be at the party but she didn't show up. There were pictures of a woman in the messages between them. Irene is the young woman in the photo, and her photos were taken in the same room where Colter just was. He goes to the equipment rental store where the camera came from and finds Irene there working. She denies everything but he brings up one of the photos and she admits that she was catfishing Blake for \"leverage.\"\n\nIrene says she and her husband, Chuck, were hired by someone on the dark web to get leverage on Blake. The people that hired them wanted to intimidate Blake so he would \"keep his mouth shut\" about some sort of secret information he had. While they talk, Colter finds a bloodstain on the carpet and has Irene show him the security video. The video shows Chuck assaulting Blake and hitting his head on the counter. Neither one of them have been seen since that happened. Irene claims she doesn't want any part of things like this but only does it because Chuck makes her, so she agrees to help Colter make things right.\n\nColter and Irene are getting ready to put their plan into action when Dory shows up at his Airstream because he missed the dinner they had planned. He explains what's going on and that he can't get the police involved because he thinks Blake could still be alive and their involvement would reduce those chances. They get the information to meet with the original client and set him up to think he's only meeting Irene. Colter hops out of the truck and chases the hooded man into the woods. He catches the man and pulls the hood down to find Dax, the other student from the grant project. Dax didn't know about any of the previous problems with Blake, he just gave the professor the information about a dark web contact. The truth about the project is that Blake's data were actually right and they showed the project wasn't as successful as the professor told his investors. Colter convinces Dax to lie to the professor and say everything went according to plan.\n\nColter calls Dory and tells him about Lyle, the professor that was blackmailing Bake and potentially has him hostage. He asks her where Lyle could be holding Blake and she brings up the old bomb shelters on campus. They meet at the biochem lab and head to the shelter together, despite Colter wanting her to stay back. Chuck is holding Blake hostage and asking for the evidence about the grant project so that he can get paid. Lyle shows up saying he heard from Dax and got a location on the evidence, which we know is the lie that Colter helped created. Chuck tells Lyle the only way to potentially fix everything is to kill Blake, but the professor doesn't want to do that. Blake says the evidence is going to get out whether he's alive or dead. Lyle instead kills Chuck and hides in the next room with Blake when he hears Colter coming. Colter shoots Lyle in the shoulder to take him down and save Blake. Lyle is potentially spending life in prison. Dax will get in some trouble not enough to tank his future. The evidence was hid in a locker back in the lab the entire time.\n\nDory and Colter finally have dinner the night before Colter is set to leave town and head to his next job. She asks why he doesn't keep up or visit more, and she thinks part of him resents her for leaving when they were younger. He says their mom needed him so he stayed back. Dory reminds him that their mom was complicit in all their dad's actions and he can't keep excusing her for it. She wants Colter and Russell to be her brothers again. Their mom is hanging on to the past and holding it over them to keep things the way they used to be. She tells Colter that their mom has been feeding and perpetuating a lie about Russell and she wants them to put it behind them. She ends the dinner encouraging him to call Russell", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Shaw_(composer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Shaw (composer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manifest (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Roxburgh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Roxburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biochemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catfishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BDSM"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dax,_Landes", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dax, Landes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dax, Landes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hops", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/05/05/a4d56529-1aea-465d-8ecb-d840c13bf2d7/tracker-episode-11-melissa-roxburgh-justin-hartley.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541596", "eventUri": "eng-9541596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available.\n\nWarning: SPOILERS for Tracker season 1, episode 11!\n\nSCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Summary Melissa Roxburgh discusses Colter's reunion with sister Dory in Tracker and what it means for the rest of the upcoming episodes. Dory wants Colter to be a bigger part of her life, but is unhappy that he has ulterior motives related to an investigation of their father's death.\n\nTracker star Melissa Roxburgh has opened up about Colter's reunion with his sister, explaining what the siblings coming together in the latest episode means for the rest of season 1. Roxburgh made her first appearance on the series in episode 11 as Dory, Colter's younger sister who works as a professor. Her appearance coincides with the show's main character investigating the truth behind their father's death, something she doesn't want to be part of.\n\nSpeaking with TVLine, Roxburgh explained how Dory's debut on the cast of Tracker will impact the rest of season 1, explaining the meaning behind their reunion. The actor explained how Colter's sister wants what's best for both him and their brother, Russell, and wants to see them all reunite in a more permanent way. Check out what Roxburgh had to say below:\n\nShe knows that he has always been like this. Their family is not normal, especially how they were raised. There's an understanding about the trauma that he's been through as well. I don't think Dory is a judgmental person at all; she really just wants what is best for her two brothers. When Colter does show up, it's like the prodigal son kind of thing. She's just happy that he's back, but then she realizes [later in the episode] that he's not really back. That's almost what upsets her more : that he isn't even showing up with the right intentions. That's what hurts her the most.\n\nMore to come...\n\nSource: TVLine", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Roxburgh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melissa Roxburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roxburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roxburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVLine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TVLine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/justin-hartley-in-tracker-episode-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541596", "eventUri": "eng-9541596", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Mary appears to know more about Ashton's death than she's letting on. Her actions sow distrust within her children. The season finale of Tracker may reveal Mary's secrets, setting the stage for a larger mystery in season 2.\n\nTracker star Melissa Roxburgh has opened up about the relationship between Dory and her mother, Mary, revealing why there's tension between the pair. Roxburgh plays the aforementioned Dory, Colter's sister who he goes to for help as part of his personal investigation into the murder of their father, Ashton, 20 years ago. The episode also revealed a level of distrust between Dory and the duo's mother, something that differs from the show's hero's trust in what she tells him.\n\nSpeaking with TVLine, Roxburgh explained the relationship between Dory and Mary, revealing why the two characters in Tracker don't have a close relationship. The actor said she doesn't think the pair are on speaking terms with each other, partially having to do with her not trusting her honesty about what happened to Ashton. Check out what Roxburgh had to say below:\n\nI would guess not. Dory is pretty smart, and I think that she clocks a lot of what her mother is doing. She knows that there is way more to the story [about Dad] than Mom has let on, for whatever reason. For Dory, trying to have a healthy life at this point means maybe not being close to Mom.\n\nWhat Does Mary Know About Ashton's Murder In Tracker?\n\nThroughout the series, it has seemed like Mary knows more about what happened during the night Ashton was killed than she is letting show. She is a central force behind keeping Colter from contacting his brother, Russell, who he suspects may have had something to do with their father's death. It's also unclear where she was at the moment her husband died. The suspicious circumstances - such as his death being ruled accidental - make it unclear as to what was really going on. It's also unknown why she doesn't want Russell near the series' hero, either.\n\nRelated Why Tracker Is So Popular On CBS Despite Divisive Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score\n\nTracker is one of the most-watched network TV shows, and despite only being in its first season, its Rotten Tomatoes score contradicts its viewership.\n\nIt's clear from the distant relationship Dory has with Mary that she doesn't trust her mother anymore, especially curious about the secrets she may be holding about the night their father died. While it's unclear if she was involved or not, it does seem like Tracker is setting the stage for her story to be turned on its head by the end of the season. This is made especially clear with the upcoming introduction of Russell, played by Jensen Ackles, whose presence may finally reveal what really happened to Ashton.\n\nWith plenty of mystery still left for the show to address, it would make sense for season 1 to end with a family confrontation, finally revealing what Mary truly knows about that dreadful night. It may even lead into Tracker season 2, opening the door on a wider mystery that Ashton's death is only one part of. With Dory's distrust possibly opening the door on a larger truth yet to be shared, it remains to be seen how the rest of season 1 will address the mystery - and how much of the truth is going to be revealed.\n\nNew episodes of Tracker air Sundays on CBS.\n\nSource: TVLine\n\nTracker (2024) TV-14ActionDrama Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nBased on the novel by Jeffery Deaver, Tracker is an action-drama series created for CBS by Ben H.

Cllr Moore said nothing will surpass the \u201ccrushing blow\u201d of finding out the day before polling that thousands of leaflets she paid for and which accounted for a substantial amount of her campaign finances, weren\u2019t delivered. \u201cThe failure of a state owned company to have appropriate checks and reporting structures in place for the delivery of election materials is quite shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite being more costly that a standard leaflet drop company, I figured it was worth the extra cost for that assurance that it is going out in the mail\u2026 there is a system there already,\u201d she said. Cllr Moore paid for the service on May 20, after which labels were sent out and she brought two boxes containing 5,900 leaflets to An Post\u2019s sorting centre to be delivered to the areas she selected. She learned Thursday that only three streets in the entire area for one of the two orders she made through the service, which delivers to all households without a \u2018no junk mail sign\u2019, were delivered. An Post cited staff shortages as a reason, she claimed, adding that she was also told that the second order she had made were only partially delivered, however, staff could not identify what streets were covered. \u201cI found all this out yesterday (Thursday) not because they volunteered the information or thought to inform me that thousands of my leaflets were still boxed and bundled in the sorting office, but because I spent two days trying to find out why no one I knew had received my election flyer,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't know who made the decision not to deliver my election leaflets, or why. And I don't know why that decision-maker wasn't obliged to inform An Post in a timely enough manner to allow me, the client, to make alternative arrangements to get them distributed before today,\u201d she said. Cllr Moore said if An Post\u2019s commercial service had a standard reporting structure in place whereby the sorting office could have relayed last week that the leaflets weren\u2019t delivered, then she could have gotten volunteers to hand deliver to those houses that never received her leaflets. She said when her husband went down to the sorting office this week to retrieve those that weren\u2019t delivered, close to 1,500 less than An Post had claimed were posted successfully, had not been. \u201cAll I know is that I'm sitting here on polling day looking at stacks of leaflets that should have gone through people's letterboxes last week, and An Post had nothing to offer but 'sorry'. \u201cIt's untenable for them to offer a commercial service if they can't do better than that,\u201d she added.

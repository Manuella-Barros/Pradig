The investigation will then be reviewed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Wyoming.\n\nYNP says that the YNP 911 dispatch center initially received a report that a woman had been held against her will by a man with a gun, later identified as Fussner, in a Canyon Village residence.\n\nThe woman reported to rangers that Fussner had threatened to kill her and others, and that he had said he allegedly planned to carry out mass shootings at 4th of July events outside of the Park.\n\nResponding rangers located Fussner's unoccupied vehicle in the Canyon Village area. Initial investigation led law enforcement to believe that Fussner was still armed and dangerous.\n\nWith the suspect at large, law enforcement rangers were quickly sent to protect areas with park visitors and employees while continuing the search for Fussner.\n\nAt approximately 8 am, law enforcement rangers near Canyon Lodge came into contact with Fussner. He reportedly walked toward the service entrance of the facility while firing a semi-automatic rifle. YNP notes that the building was occupied by roughly 200 people at the time.\n\nSeveral law enforcement officers then engaged with Fussner who was shot by rangers during an exchange of gunfire. One law enforcement ranger was also shot in the exchange.\n\nAid was rendered to both Fussner and the ranger who had been shot. Fussner died at the scene. The ranger was transported to a nearby hospital in stable condition and has since been released.\n\nNo other injuries were reported.\n\nFussner was an employee of Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business that operates guest accommodations within YNP.\n\nVictim/witness support is being provided to anyone who was involved in the incident by the FBI, with support from NPS, Xanterra, and other partners.\n\nNPS policy for a law enforcement involved shooting calls for involved law enforcement rangers to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation of the incident. Consistent with Department of the Interior and NPS policies, the NPS will release available body worn camera footage of the incident within 30 days.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" said Superintendent Cam Sholly. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety. We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families. We appreciate the support of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, and many other partners as we continue to manage through the aftermath of this incident.\"\n\nUPDATE: July 8, 2024 at 10:07 AM\n\nThe person who died due to park rangers' gunshot wounds in a shootout after threatening people in Yellowstone National Park on the Fourth of July has been identified as Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, a 28-year-old from Florida, according to Park County, Wyoming Coroner Cody Gortmaker.\n\nPark County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) said on social media additional information is pending investigation between the FBI, National Park Service and PCSO.\n\nUPDATE: July 4, 2024 at 4:30 pm\n\nFood service at the Canyon Village will be limited until further notice while the investigation is underway, according to Rick Hoeninghausen, the marketing director for Xanterra in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nHoeninghausen says he is unable to provide additional details at this time.\n\nXanterra Travel Collection is the company primarily responsible for managing guest accommodations in Yellowstone National Park.\n\nXanterra also wanted to express their appreciation for what the rangers do every day as they put their lives on the line to ensure the safety of Park guests. They say that non-life-threatening injuries don't diminish the seriousness of the situation adding that, \"It is a big park, but a small work family.\"\n\nHe says the thoughts of the entire Xanterra family are with the ranger who was injured and all those who responded to take care of the situation earlier today. He says Xanterra thanks them and wishes the injured ranger the speediest recovery.\n\nOriginal Coverage: July 4, 2024 at 11:41 am\n\nBIG SKY, Mont. - A person making threats with a gun in Canyon Village in Yellowstone National Park on the morning of July 4, 2024, was shot and killed by park rangers.

The woman reported that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including carrying out a mass shooting at July 4 events outside the park.\n\nRangers found Fussner's vehicle but not him.

An unidentified park ranger who was wounded in \"a lower extremity\" during the shootout was treated at an area hospital and released. Fussner died at the scene.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the building was occupied by about 200 people. Consistent with Department of the Interior and NPS policies, the body-camera footage of the incident will be released within 30 days.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety.\"\n\nMore than 20 Park Service law enforcement rangers, including the park's special response team, were dispatched to Canyon Village early July 4 after a woman called 911. She told the Yellowstone dispatch center she had been held against her will by Fussner in a residence at Canyon Village.\n\n\"She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park,\" the news release stated.\n\nAn alert was then sent out to surrounding law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for Fussner, providing a description of his vehicle. A recording of the warning was posted on Facebook.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhen officers arrived at Canyon Village, they located Fussner's vehicle, but it was unoccupied. The news release did not indicate how long the delay was between the officers' arrival and the shootout.\n\nThe incident is under investigation by the FBI, which is also providing victim/witness support to anyone involved in the incident along with the Park Service and Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a park concessionaire. Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park. In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker. In 1978, in the Boiling River area north of Mammoth Hot Springs, a California 17-year-old was fatally shot by a man he was traveling with.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

An unidentified park ranger who was wounded in \"a lower extremity\" during the shootout was treated at an area hospital and released. Fussner died at the scene.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the building was occupied by about 200 people. Consistent with Department of the Interior and NPS policies, the body-camera footage of the incident will be released within 30 days.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety.\"\n\nMore than 20 Park Service law enforcement rangers, including the park's special response team, were dispatched to Canyon Village early July 4 after a woman called 911. She told the Yellowstone dispatch center she had been held against her will by Fussner in a residence at Canyon Village.\n\n\"She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park,\" the news release stated.\n\nAn alert was then sent out to surrounding law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for Fussner, providing a description of his vehicle. A recording of the warning was posted on Facebook.\n\nWhen officers arrived at Canyon Village, they located Fussner's vehicle, but it was unoccupied. The news release did not indicate how long the delay was between the officers' arrival and the shootout.\n\nThe incident is under investigation by the FBI, which is also providing victim/witness support to anyone involved in the incident along with the Park Service and Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a park concessionaire. Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nCrime-courts\n\nWhy mass shootings and violence increase in the summer\n\nBy JOHN SEEWER - Associated Press\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park.

(AP) -- The warning from a woman in Yellowstone National Park came in just after midnight on July Fourth: She'd just been held at gunpoint by a man who said he planned to carry out a mass shooting -- a random attack common in the U.S. these days but not in the Yellowstone region, let alone the park itself.\n\nRangers spent the next several hours trying to find the gunman before he showed up outside a dining area with 200 people inside. He shot a barrage of bullets with a semi-automatic rifle at a service entrance.\n\nThe rangers -- including one who was wounded -- shot back. Their rounds hit the attacker, Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida, who died at the scene in the busy Canyon Village tourist lodge area near the scenic Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.\n\nThe previously unreleased details provided by park officials Tuesday revealed a harrowing situation that seemingly could have ended badly and raised new questions about the attacker's intent and motivations.\n\nFussner's Facebook page showed if anything pride about landing a concession job in Yellowstone, a typically seasonal gig that often involves cooking and serving food to the park's 3 million summer visitors. Such jobs usually go to somewhat younger people in their early 20s; often they are college students who journey into the U.S. from a variety of other countries.\n\nFussner posted a photo of his Xanterra Parks and Resorts badge and photos of him in snowy Yellowstone scenes from mid May, at the onset of summer tourist season. There are no posts hinting at anger or any other motivation for the shooting.\n\nAnd while Yellowstone often draws headlines for sometimes deadly mishaps involving wildlife and the park's famous hot springs, shootings -- despite the park's millions of visitors and high rate of gun ownership in the region -- are exceedingly rare. No attack like this one has happened in the park in recent memory.\n\nThe wounded ranger was released from a hospital but not identified. The shooting led authorities to close off Canyon Lodge, a complex of hotel rooms, cabins and dining facilities, until Wednesday.\n\nThe facilities are run by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, the main concessionaire for such facilities in Yellowstone.\n\nSoon after midnight July 4, law enforcement rangers heard that Fussner had held a woman against her will with a gun at a residence in Canyon Village, a lodging and dining area. The woman reported that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including carrying out a mass shooting at Independence Day events outside the park, park officials said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nRangers found Fussner's vehicle but not him.

(AP) -- The warning from a woman in Yellowstone National Park came in just after midnight on July Fourth: She'd just been held at gunpoint by a man who said he planned to carry out a mass shooting -- a random attack common in the U.S. these days but not in the Yellowstone region, let alone the park itself.\n\nRangers spent the next several hours trying to find the gunman before he showed up outside a dining area with 200 people inside. He shot a barrage of bullets with a semi-automatic rifle at a service entrance.\n\nThe rangers -- including one who was wounded -- shot back. Their rounds hit the attacker, Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida, who died at the scene in the busy Canyon Village tourist lodge area near the scenic Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.\n\nThe previously unreleased details provided by park officials Tuesday revealed a harrowing situation that seemingly could have ended badly and raised new questions about the attacker's intent and motivations.\n\nFussner's Facebook page showed if anything pride about landing a concession job in Yellowstone, a typically seasonal gig that often involves cooking and serving food to the park's 3 million summer visitors. Such jobs usually go to somewhat younger people in their early 20s; often they are college students who journey into the U.S. from a variety of other countries.\n\nFussner posted a photo of his Xanterra Parks and Resorts badge and photos of him in snowy Yellowstone scenes from mid May, at the onset of summer tourist season. There are no posts hinting at anger or any other motivation for the shooting.\n\nAnd while Yellowstone often draws headlines for sometimes deadly mishaps involving wildlife and the park's famous hot springs, shootings -- despite the park's millions of visitors and high rate of gun ownership in the region -- are exceedingly rare. No attack like this one has happened in the park in recent memory.\n\nThe wounded ranger was released from a hospital but not identified. The shooting led authorities to close off Canyon Lodge, a complex of hotel rooms, cabins and dining facilities, until Wednesday.\n\nThe facilities are run by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, the main concessionaire for such facilities in Yellowstone.\n\nSoon after midnight July 4, law enforcement rangers heard that Fussner had held a woman against her will with a gun at a residence in Canyon Village, a lodging and dining area. The woman reported that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including carrying out a mass shooting at Independence Day events outside the park, park officials said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nRangers found Fussner's vehicle but not him. More than 20 law enforcement rangers, including a park special response team, looked for Fussner while organizing to protect park visitors and employees.\n\nAround 8 a.m. Thursday, law enforcement rangers encountered Fussner as he approached and fired on a service entrance to the Canyon Lodge dining facility. Several of the rangers shot at Fussner, and he died at the scene, according to the statement.\n\nNo other injuries were reported.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said in the statement.\n\nThe FBI was investigating. Per National Park Service policy, law enforcement rangers involved in a shooting are placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, the statement said.\n\nPark officials did not immediately comment when asked if any Yellowstone law enforcement rangers had been placed on leave, and how much weaponry Fussner possessed.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanterra_Travel_Collection", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xanterra Travel Collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon_of_the_Yellowstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_(contract)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concession (contract)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milton, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando nightclub shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hot spring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Park ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Defunct", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Defunct", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "summary_large_image", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716702", "eventUri": "eng-9716702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 2265, "textEnd": 2271}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

An unidentified park ranger who was wounded in \"a lower extremity\" during the shootout was treated at an area hospital and released. Fussner died at the scene.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the building was occupied by about 200 people.

A recording of the warning was posted on Facebook.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhen officers arrived at Canyon Village, they located Fussner's vehicle, but it was unoccupied. The news release did not indicate how long the delay was between the officers' arrival and the shootout.\n\nThe incident is under investigation by the FBI, which is also providing victim/witness support to anyone involved in the incident along with the Park Service and Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a park concessionaire. Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nCrime-courts Why mass shootings and violence increase in the summer By JOHN SEEWER - Associated Press\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park. In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker. In 1978, in the Boiling River area north of Mammoth Hot Springs, a California 17-year-old was fatally shot by a man he was traveling with.\n\nYes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are more frequent Yes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are more frequent Mass shootings have been on the rise steadily for the past 40 years While shooting incidents show a gradual

The shooter, identified as 28-year-old Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner of Milton, Florida, was firing a semi-automatic rifle toward a dining facility. Fussner was killed during an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement rangers. The incident is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and reviewed by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Wyoming.\n\nThe incident began just after midnight when Yellowstone's 911 dispatch center received a report of a woman being held against her will by Fussner at Canyon Village. The woman reported that Fussner had threatened to kill her and others, including plans for mass shootings at July 4th events outside the park.\n\nLaw enforcement rangers located Fussner's unoccupied vehicle in the Canyon area and deployed to protect park visitors and employees while searching for him. By the early hours of July 4, over 20 National Park Service (NPS) law enforcement rangers, including the park's special response team, were involved in the operation.\n\nAt approximately 8 a.m., law enforcement rangers encountered Fussner near Canyon Lodge, which houses dining rooms for employees and the public. Fussner was firing a semi-automatic rifle as he approached the service entrance, with about 200 people inside the building. Rangers engaged Fussner, resulting in an exchange of gunfire during which Fussner was shot and killed. One ranger was injured but has since been released from the hospital.\n\nFussner was an employee of Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business operating in Yellowstone.

(AP) -- The warning from a woman in Yellowstone National Park came in just after midnight on July Fourth: She'd just been held at gunpoint by a man who said he planned to carry out a mass shooting -- a random attack common in the U.S. these days but not in the Yellowstone region, let alone the park itself.\n\nRangers spent the next several hours trying to find the gunman before he showed up outside a dining area with 200 people inside. He shot a barrage of bullets with a semi-automatic rifle at a service entrance.\n\nThe rangers -- including one who was wounded -- shot back. Their rounds hit the attacker, Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida, who died at the scene in the busy Canyon Village tourist lodge area near the scenic Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.\n\nThe previously unreleased details provided by park officials Tuesday revealed a harrowing situation that seemingly could have ended badly and raised new questions about the attacker's intent and motivations.\n\nFussner's Facebook page showed if anything pride about landing a concession job in Yellowstone, a typically seasonal gig that often involves cooking and serving food to the park's 3 million summer visitors. Such jobs usually go to somewhat younger people in their early 20s; often they are college students who journey into the U.S. from a variety of other countries.\n\nFussner posted a photo of his Xanterra Parks and Resorts badge and photos of him in snowy Yellowstone scenes from mid May, at the onset of summer tourist season. There are no posts hinting at anger or any other motivation for the shooting.\n\nAnd while Yellowstone often draws headlines for sometimes deadly mishaps involving wildlife and the park's famous hot springs, shootings -- despite the park's millions of visitors and high rate of gun ownership in the region -- are exceedingly rare. No attack like this one has happened in the park in recent memory.\n\nThe wounded ranger was released from a hospital but not identified. The shooting led authorities to close off Canyon Lodge, a complex of hotel rooms, cabins and dining facilities, until Wednesday.\n\nThe facilities are run by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, the main concessionaire for such facilities in Yellowstone.\n\nSoon after midnight July 4, law enforcement rangers heard that Fussner had held a woman against her will with a gun at a residence in Canyon Village, a lodging and dining area. The woman reported that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including carrying out a mass shooting at Independence Day events outside the park, park officials said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nRangers found Fussner's vehicle but not him. More than 20 law enforcement rangers, including a park special response team, looked for Fussner while organizing to protect park visitors and employees.\n\nAround 8 a.m. Thursday, law enforcement rangers encountered Fussner as he approached and fired on a service entrance to the Canyon Lodge dining facility. Several of the rangers shot at Fussner, and he died at the scene, according to the statement.\n\nNo other injuries were reported.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said in the statement.\n\nThe FBI was investigating. Per National Park Service policy, law enforcement rangers involved in a shooting are placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, the statement said.\n\nPark officials did not immediately comment when asked if any Yellowstone law enforcement rangers had been placed on leave, and how much weaponry Fussner possessed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMocPOGO Pokemon GO Hacks Updated: Fixes Failed to Detect Location Error 12\n\nDirect Mail Benchmark Report 2024 reveals 61% of marketers have increased direct mail investments in the last year\n\nThe Legacy of Civil Rights Leader Rev.

Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nCrime-courts Why mass shootings and violence increase in the summer By JOHN SEEWER - Associated Press\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park. In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker. In 1978, in the Boiling River area north of Mammoth Hot Springs, a California 17-year-old was fatally shot by a man he was traveling with.\n\nYes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are

Their rounds hit the attacker, Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida, who died at the scene in the busy Canyon Village tourist lodge area near the scenic Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.\n\nThe previously unreleased details provided by park officials Tuesday revealed a harrowing situation that seemingly could have ended badly and raised new questions about the attacker's intent and motivations.\n\nFussner's Facebook page showed if anything pride about landing a concession job in Yellowstone, a typically seasonal gig that often involves cooking and serving food to the park's 3 million summer visitors. Such jobs usually go to somewhat younger people in their early 20s; often they are college students who journey into the U.S. from a variety of other countries.\n\nFussner posted a photo of his Xanterra Parks and Resorts badge and photos of him in snowy Yellowstone scenes from mid May, at the onset of summer tourist season. There are no posts hinting at anger or any other motivation for the shooting.\n\nAnd while Yellowstone often draws headlines for sometimes deadly mishaps involving wildlife and the park's famous hot springs, shootings -- despite the park's millions of visitors and high rate of gun ownership in the region -- are exceedingly rare. No attack like this one has happened in the park in recent memory.\n\nThe wounded ranger was released from a hospital but not identified. The shooting led authorities to close off Canyon Lodge, a complex of hotel rooms, cabins and dining facilities, until Wednesday.\n\nThe facilities are run by Xanterra Parks and Resorts, the main concessionaire for such facilities in Yellowstone.\n\nSoon after midnight July 4, law enforcement rangers heard that Fussner had held a woman against her will with a gun at a residence in Canyon Village, a lodging and dining area. The woman reported that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including carrying out a mass shooting at Independence Day events outside the park, park officials said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nRangers found Fussner's vehicle but not him. More than 20 law enforcement rangers, including a park special response team, looked for Fussner while organizing to protect park visitors and employees.\n\nAround 8 a.m. Thursday, law enforcement rangers encountered Fussner as he approached and fired on a service entrance to the Canyon Lodge dining facility. Several of the rangers shot at Fussner, and he died at the scene, according to the statement.\n\nNo other injuries were reported.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said in the statement.\n\nThe FBI was investigating.

Fussner was an employee of park concessionaire Xanterra Parks and Resorts.\n\nShe also reported that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including a plan to allegedly carry out a mass shooting or shootings at Independence Day events outside the park.\n\nRangers responded to the call, located Fussner's vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area, and learned Fussner was likely armed and dangerous.\n\nBy early July 4, over 20 NPS rangers, including the park's special response team, were deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner. Meanwhile, the park's 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions.\n\nAt about 8 a.m., rangers stationed themselves near Canyon Lodge, which houses employee and public dining rooms. About 200 people were in the building.\n\nThey saw Fussner walking toward the service entrance of the lodge while firing a semi-automatic rifle, according to the press release.\n\nSeveral rangers engaged Fussner and shot him.

He shot a barrage of bullets with a semi-automatic rifle at a service entrance.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

There are no posts hinting at anger or any other motivation for the shooting.\n\nAnd while Yellowstone often draws headlines for sometimes deadly mishaps involving wildlife and the park's famous hot springs, shootings -- despite the park's millions of visitors and high rate of gun ownership in the region -- are exceedingly rare.

Approximately 200 people were in the facility at the time, NPS said in an update on the incident Tuesday.\n\nDuring an exchange of gunfire, Fussner was shot by law enforcement rangers and died at the scene, NPS said. A ranger was also shot in a lower extremity, NPS said. The injured ranger was transported to an area hospital in stable condition and has since been released, NPS said. No other injuries were reported.\n\nFussner was an employee of Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business authorized to operate in Yellowstone, according to NPS. ABC News has reached out to the business for comment.\n\nMORE: Suspect fatally shot by park rangers at Yellowstone National Park after allegedly making threats\n\nLaw enforcement rangers initially began searching for the suspect after Yellowstone's 911 dispatch center received a report just after midnight on July 4 \"that a woman had been held against her will by a man with a gun in a residence at Canyon Village,\" NPS said in a press release.\n\n\"She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park,\" NPS said.\n\nRangers were \"strategically deployed\" in the park amid the search for Fussner, NPS said. Those posted near Canyon Lodge -- which houses employee and public dining rooms in the center of the park -- encountered him around 8 a.m. local time as he \"reportedly walked toward the service entrance of the facility while firing a semi-automatic rifle,\" NPS said.\n\nMORE: Marshal guarding Supreme Court justice's home shoots 18-year-old who tried to carjack him\n\nThe investigation into this incident is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will be reviewed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Wyoming, the NPS said. The probe will include the shooting involving the rangers, who have been placed on paid administrative leave amid the investigation per NPS policy.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety.

Consistent with Department of the Interior and NPS policies, the body-camera footage of the incident will be released within 30 days.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" Superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety.\"\n\nMore than 20 Park Service law enforcement rangers, including the park's special response team, were dispatched to Canyon Village early July 4 after a woman called 911. She told the Yellowstone dispatch center she had been held against her will by Fussner in a residence at Canyon Village.\n\n\"She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park,\" the news release stated.\n\nAn alert was then sent out to surrounding law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for Fussner, providing a description of his vehicle. A recording of the warning was posted on Facebook.\n\nWhen officers arrived at Canyon Village, they located Fussner's vehicle, but it was unoccupied. The news release did not indicate how long the delay was between the officers' arrival and the shootout.\n\nThe incident is under investigation by the FBI, which is also providing victim/witness support to anyone involved in the incident along with the Park Service and Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a park concessionaire. Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nCrime-courts Why mass shootings and violence increase in the summer By JOHN SEEWER - Associated Press\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park. In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker. In 1978, in the Boiling River area north of Mammoth Hot Springs, a California 17-year-old was fatally shot by a man he was traveling with.\n\nYes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are

By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nNational Why mass shootings and violence increase in the summer By JOHN SEEWER - Associated Press\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park. In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker. In 1978, in the Boiling River area north of Mammoth Hot Springs, a California 17-year-old was fatally shot by a man he was traveling with.\n\nYes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are

Fussner and a park ranger were shot in the ensuing gunfire. Fussner died at the scene, the NPS said.\n\nThe NPS, FBI and local authorities are investigating the incident.\n\nHere's what we know.\n\nFussner, who went by Lucas on his Facebook page, was an employee of Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business authorized to operate in Yellowstone. A profile picture he posted in May shows an employee ID with an expiration date in September.\n\nFussner was from Milton, according to NPS, near Pensacola. According to court records, Fussner is related to Gideon Fussner, 26, a Pensacola man who was acquitted of two counts of second-degree murder and one count of aggravated battery in 2018.\n\nAccording to the NPS release, a woman called the park's 911 dispatch center saying she'd been held against her will by a man with a gun in Canyon Village, an area in the center of the park with lodging and restaurants. She told park rangers that Fussner threatened to kill many other people in a mass shooting.\n\nA recording of the BOLO announcement sent by the Yellowstone communications center said he was an \"armed and dangerous suspect\" driving a 2021 silver Nissan Rogue with Florida plates, and that he \"threatened suicide by cop\" and \"threatened to shoot up a fireworks show somewhere in west Yellowstone or Montana.\" The BOLO said he had a pistol, a knife, and possibly other weapons.\n\nBy early morning on July 4, 20 rangers, including the park's special response team, were deployed to protect areas with visitors while searching for Fussner, the NPS said.\n\nAt about 8 a.m., Fussner reportedly walked toward the service entrance of Canyon Lodge, which houses employee and public dining rooms and was occupied by about 200 people, with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire. Several rangers fired back and in the exchange, Fussner was shot and one ranger was shot in a lower extremity, the NPS said. Rangers with EMT training helped both people but Fussner was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Park County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe injured ranger was treated at a local hospital and released, the NPS said. No other injuries were reported.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" said NPS Superintendent Cam Sholly. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety.

She told the Yellowstone dispatch center she had been held against her will by Fussner in a residence at Canyon Village.\n\n\"She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park,\" the news release stated.\n\nAn alert was then sent out to surrounding law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for Fussner, providing a description of his vehicle. A recording of the warning was posted on Facebook.\n\nWhen officers arrived at Canyon Village, they located Fussner's vehicle, but it was unoccupied. The news release did not indicate how long the delay was between the officers' arrival and the shootout.\n\nThe incident is under investigation by the FBI, which is also providing victim/witness support to anyone involved in the incident along with the Park Service and Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a park concessionaire. Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park. In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker.

He was an employee of Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business that operates lodges in Yellowstone.\n\nThe FBI is leading the investigation of the shooting, including the actions of the National Park Service law enforcement rangers. The U.S. attorney's office for the District of Wyoming will later review the investigation. Yellowstone National Park and the National Park Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" park superintendent Cam Sholly said in a statement. \"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families.\"\n\nAn unidentified woman called Yellowstone's 911 dispatch just after midnight on July 4. She told law enforcement she had been held against her will by a man with a gun in a residence at Canyon Village, according to the news release.\n\nLaw enforcement rangers located his vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area, according to the release. Rangers believed Fussner was probably armed and dangerous and sent rangers, including the park's special response team, across the park to monitor areas with park visitors and employees and to look for Fussner. The park's 911 dispatch center also notified surrounding areas about the threat.\n\nRangers came across Fussner about 8 a.m. near Canyon Lodge, which houses employee and public dining rooms. Fussner was walking to the service entrance of the facility while firing a semiautomatic rifle, according to the news release. About 200 people were inside the building.\n\nFussner was shot and killed by law enforcement rangers during a gunfight. One law enforcement ranger was shot in a lower extremity and was recently released from a hospital in the area, according to the release. No other physical injuries were reported.\n\nLaw enforcement officers involved in a shooting call are placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation of the incident, in accordance with NPS policy.\n\nShootings at national parks are not very common. However, a 19-year-old man was shot and critically injured at Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina on May 29, according to the NPS website. A National Parks database breaks down the number of and types of deaths that occur at the parks. The mortality dashboard, which surveys deaths from 2014 to 2019, counts only two deaths from \"legal intervention\" and 25 homicides over that span.\n\nAccording to the Park Service, gun laws in national parks comply with the laws of the states where parks are located. Everytown Research & Policy ranks the gun laws in Wyoming as some of the least restrictive in the country; the state does not prohibit assault weapons.\n\nFederal law prohibits the possession of firearms and other dangerous weapons inside NPS facilities.

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available.\n\nSummary\n\nTragedy struck in Yellowstone Park as shooter Samson Fussner, an Xanterra employee, engaged park rangers in a shootout. Fussner, holding a female hostage, threatened \"suicide by cop\" during the altercation in Canyon Village. Park visitors mistook the 100 gunshots for fireworks; investigations by the FBI are ongoing with no motive revealed.\n\nA tragedy unfolded in Yellowstone National Park on July 4th when a shooter, now identified as Samson Lucas Fussner (28, Florida) by Park County Coroner Cody Gortmaker, opened fire on park rangers. Fussner had threatened to \"shoot up a fireworks show somewhere in West Yellowstone or Montana,\" according to a Be On The Lookout (BOLO) announcement from the national park's communications center.\n\nFussner was employed by Xanterra Travel Collection, a company responsible for Yellowstone's park lodging and concessions. In the time leading up to the shootout between the suspect and park rangers, Fussner held a female hostage at gunpoint, the identity of whom is still unconfirmed. During the altercation, Fussner threatened \"suicide by cop\" in an exchange that started late Wednesday night and continued until early Thursday morning.\n\nThe sign for Canyon Village outside Yellowstone National Park\n\nThe exchange of gunfire took place in Canyon Village, where park rangers were dispatched following confirmation that the suspect carried a pistol and potentially two larger weapons in addition. Fussner was fatally wounded during the shootout, and a park ranger also incurred injuries and was transported to a nearby hospital. As of the time of writing, the park ranger is in stable condition.\n\nAccording to Cowboy State Daily, park visitors heard around 100 gunshots that were initially mistaken for fireworks, given the date.

In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker. In 1978, in the Boiling River area north of Mammoth Hot Springs, a California 17-year-old was fatally shot by a man he was traveling with.\n\nYes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are more frequent Yes, it's getting worse: New data shows mass shootings are more frequent Mass shootings have been on the rise steadily for the past 40 years While shooting incidents show a gradual

The shooter has been identified by the Park County, Wyoming coroner as Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida. Fussner died after an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement. The investigation into this incident, including the actions of the National Park Service (NPS) law enforcement rangers, is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Wyoming.\n\nJust after midnight on July 4, Yellowstone's 911 dispatch center received a report that a woman had been held against her will by a man with a gun in a residence at Canyon Village. She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park.\n\nResponding law enforcement rangers located his vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area. The preliminary investigation indicated Fussner was likely armed and dangerous. With the individual\u202fat large,\u202flaw enforcement rangers were strategically deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner, and the park's 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions. By the early hours of July 4, over 20 NPS law enforcement rangers, including the park's special response team,\u202fwere working to protect people and locate Fussner.\n\nAt approximately 8 a.m., law enforcement rangers posted near Canyon Lodge, which houses employee and public dining rooms, encountered Fussner. Fussner reportedly walked toward the service entrance of the facility while firing a semi-automatic rifle. The building was occupied by approximately 200 people at the time. Several law enforcement rangers engaged Fussner. During an exchange of gunfire, Fussner was shot by law enforcement rangers. In addition, one law enforcement ranger was shot in a lower extremity. Additional rangers with emergency medical training rendered aid to both the injured law enforcement ranger and Fussner. Fussner died at the scene. The injured law enforcement ranger was transported to an area hospital in stable condition and has since been released. No other physical injuries were reported.\n\nFussner was an employee of Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business authorized to operate in Yellowstone.\n\nThe FBI, with support from the NPS, Xanterra and other partners, is providing victim/witness support to anyone who was involved in the incident.\n\nNPS policy for a law enforcement involved shooting calls for involved law enforcement rangers to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation of the incident. Consistent with Department of the Interior and NPS policies, the NPS will release available body worn camera footage of the incident within 30 days.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" said Superintendent Cam Sholly. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety.

Consistent with Department of the Interior and NPS policies, the body camera footage of the incident will be released within 30 days.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" said Superintendent Cam Sholly in a statement. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

She told the Yellowstone dispatch center she had been held against her will by Fussner in a residence at Canyon Village.\n\n\"She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park,\" the press release stated.\n\nAn alert was then sent out to surrounding law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for Fussner, providing a description of his vehicle. A recording of the warning was posted on Facebook.\n\nWhen officers arrived at Canyon Village, they located Fussner's vehicle but it was unoccupied. The press release did not indicate how long the delay was between the officers' arrival and the shootout.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe incident is under investigation by the FBI which is also providing victim/witness support to anyone involved in the incident along with the Park Service and Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a park concessionaire. Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\n\"All remaining lodging (including the Western cabins, and the remaining two of seven guest lodges) will reopen tomorrow, July 10,\" Xanterra posted.\n\nAlso open on Tuesday was food service at the Eatery, the M66 Lounge and regularly scheduled tours from Canyon Lodge.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News. The first officer-involved shooting in Yellowstone came sometime between 1916 and 1920 when former Chief Scout Jim McBride was shot by a poacher, Ranger News reported.\n\nViolent crime is rare in Yellowstone Park. In 1997, in the Frog Rock area six miles east of Mammoth, there was a murder-suicide involving and a 69-year-old Idaho mother and the shooter, her 48-year-old son. The pair had been on the lam following a check fraud and auto theft scheme, according to the Cowboy State Daily.\n\nIn 1985, near Old Faithful, a 22-year-old park employee was beaten to death by a co-worker. In 1978, in the Boiling River area north of Mammoth Hot Springs, a California 17-year-old was shot dead by a man he was traveling with.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Get recaps, insights, and exclusive takes with Velo's daily newsletter. Sign up today!.\n\nVisitors to Yellowstone National Park over the Independence Day weekend were rocked by news of a fatal shootout that occurred within park boundaries on the morning of July 4. That afternoon, the NPS published a press release about the incident: rangers responding to an emergency call had exchanged gunfire with an unidentified man at Canyon Village, one of the park's busiest destinations.\n\nOfficials shot and killed the armed man, the release said, and one ranger received wounds in the exchange and was treated at a nearby hospital. The NPS said the Federal Bureau of Investigation had launched an inquiry into the shooting.\n\nThe incident occurred during one of the busiest periods at Yellowstone, with tens of thousands of visitors entering the park throughout the weekend. Afterward, one of the park's biggest lodges was shuttered -- a move that impacted hundreds of visitors.\n\nThe NPS has yet to disseminate any additional information on the incident after the initial press release. But local news outlets have published more details on the shooting, the suspect, and the fallout. Here's a quick rundown of what has been reported.\n\nThe original NPS release said the incident took place late on July 3 and into the morning of July 4 at Canyon Lodge, a collection of hotel rooms, cabins, and employee dormitories within Canyon Village. Rangers responded to a report of an individual with a firearm \"making threats,\" and when rangers made contact with the individual, gunfire broke out.\n\nEmployees and visitors told local media that they realized something was amiss in the area early on the morning of July 4. One employee arriving to work at the Canyon Lodge restaurant at 7 A.M. was turned home due to an \"active shooter,\" a source told the Jackson Hole News and Guide.\n\nShortly thereafter, gunshots rang out across Canyon Village. Park visitors Janet Paulsen and Mike Erickson told Cowboy State Daily that they heard approximately 100 pops at 8 A.M. The two thought the explosions were fireworks, but they later learned that they were gunshots.\n\nGuests and employees took cover. Local TV station KTVQ reported that some employees barricaded themselves in buildings and storage closets. A Texas woman named Channing Bartlee said her daughter, who works in Yellowstone, texted her an emergency message from her dorm room at 8:36 A.M. local time. Bartlee relayed her daughter's experience to the Jackson Hole News and Guide: she had watched rangers exchange gunfire with the suspect outside her window, and saw a ranger receive a gunshot wound in his leg. She had barricaded herself in her room with a mattress.\n\nAfter the shooting, officials with NPS and law enforcement swarmed the area, closing Canyon Village and evacuating guests. Later in the day, Xanterra Travel Collection, the company that operates Canyon Lodge, alerted guests that the hotel and campground had been closed until Monday, July 8. The service station and general store reopened Friday evening.\n\n\"We know this is an extreme inconvenience, and we are very sorry,\" read the closure notice.\n\nOn Sunday, July 7, the Jackson Hole News & Guide and Cowboy State Daily identified the alleged shooter as 28-year-old Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner. Both outlets confirmed his identify with the Park County Coroner, who said Fussner died of gunshot wounds.\n\nAccording to the sites, Fussner was employed by Xanterra Travel Collection as a contract employee inside the park. Cowboy State Daily said Fussner's Facebook page included a photo of his Yellowstone Xanterra identification card, which said his employee agreement with the company ran through September 15.\n\nThe Facebook page NPS Ranger News published the audio of a Be On the Look Out (BOLO) alert for Fussner that was sent by Yellowstone rangers prior to the shootout. According to the announcement, Fussner had allegedly taken a woman hostage at gunpoint and then \"threatened suicide by cop.\"\n\nThe alert said that Fussner had also allegedly threatened to \"shoot up a fireworks show\" in West Yellowstone or Montana. The short alert said Fussner was last seen fleeing the park in a Nissan Rogue with Florida license plates. According to Jackson Hole News & Guide, the audio was uploaded by a retired NPS ranger named Greg Jackson, who heard it on his own scanner. Jackson told the newspaper that the alert went out at approximately 2 A.M. on Thursday, July 4.\n\nOn July 4, the Facebook page NPS Ranger News published photos of heavily armed officials patrolling the Bison employee housing unit within Canyon Village. The photos were taken after the shooting, the caption said.\n\nCanyon Village is a sprawling complex in the heart of the park located 35 miles from the northernmost entrance. It comprises a visitor center, restaurant, general store, and multiple parking lots. It's adjacent to the popular Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, a 20-mile gorge created by the Yellowstone river, and is the jumping-off point to reach the picturesque Lower Falls, the 300-foot waterfall that's one of the most-photographed attractions in the park.\n\nCanyon Village is also the largest lodging property within the park, and its centerpiece is Canyon Lodge and Cabins, which has 400 hotel rooms and 100 cabins for guests. Across the Canyon Rim Trail is the Canyon campground. There's also employee housing in the complex for workers employed by Xanterra and Delaware North -- the two concessionaires that staff Yellowstone.\n\nOn Facebook posts for news outlets covering the shooting, I read multiple commenters asking if it's legal to bring a gun to Yellowstone. Technically, yes, you can. There's murky legislation overseeing the use of guns in National Parks. In 2010, congress enacted a law allowing visitors to bring loaded guns into National Park System sites if the state in which the park is located permits weapons. Yellowstone sits on land overseen by Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and all three states allow individuals over 18 to possess concealed firearms.\n\nBut federal law still prohibits guests from actually shooting firearms in national parks. Hunting is illegal, and target practice is also banned. Guns are also forbidden inside NPS buildings and facilities -- this includes lodges, visitor centers, and any structure with a public entrance.", "source": {"uri": "outsideonline.com", "dataType":

She told the Yellowstone dispatch center she had been held against her will by Fussner in a residence at Canyon Village.\n\n\"She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park,\" the news release stated.\n\nAn alert was then sent out to surrounding law enforcement agencies warning them to be on the lookout for Fussner, providing a description of his vehicle.

The news release did not indicate how long the delay was between the officers' arrival and the shootout.\n\nThe incident is under investigation by the FBI, which is also providing victim/witness support to anyone involved in the incident along with the Park Service and Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a park concessionaire. Fussner was a Xanterra employee.\n\n\"We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families,\" Sholly said.\n\nNPS policy for law enforcement involved in a shooting calls for them to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.\n\nSome facilities at Canyon Village were temporarily closed, including the campground. By Tuesday, the campground had been reopened along with \"a limited quantity of select rooms and most remaining visitor services,\" Xanterra noted on its website.\n\nThe July 4 Yellowstone shooting is the 120th officer-involved shooting in National Park Service history, according to NPS Ranger News.

One said he heard eight shots, then a barrage of another 30.\n\nLaw enforcement killed Fussner, a 38-year-old Florida resident and concession worker, after Yellowstone officials said he walked toward an occupied building firing a semi-automatic rifle. The killing left workers rattled and uneasy.\n\nThe workers interviewed were young, many were foreigners and most asked that their names not be used. All those interviewed said they were offered counseling following the Independence Day incident.\n\nSome knew Fussner, vaguely. The employees are seasonal and only begin working when the complex starts to open in mid-May.\n\n\"He was around, he worked,\" said one female employee who told her story outside the Canyon Eatery. She did not want to give her name.\n\nFussner wasn't necessarily an oddball, she said, but \"we didn't talk to him a lot.\"\n\n\"They knew there was a guy with a gun,\" she said. \"The night before they told us we couldn't go out at night. \"The next day, everything happened.\n\n\"I heard shots,\" she said. \"There were a lot, like 30. It scared me.\"\n\nThe park has since released an account of how authorities learned of Fussner's threats just after midnight Thursday and searched widely for him. They encountered him only when was seen at about 8 a.m. Thursday advancing toward the service entrance of a facility the Park Service said was occupied by 200 people and which they identified only as Canyon Lodge.\n\nThe Canyon Village complex includes a Visitor Education Center, several restaurants, some retail shops and a bear spray rental kiosk. The Canyon Lodge next door has several multi-story hotel buildings and associated cabins.\n\nEmployees live in dorms between the Lodge buildings and the retail, food and visitor center complex. The village is named after the nearby Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River that features the river's iconic Lower Falls.\n\nOutside the Canyon Eatery on Tuesday, a group of three workers finished their lunch in the shade as they prepared to get back to their jobs, which returned to regular schedules later that day.\n\nThey heard gunshots. How many?\n\n\"Too many,\" one said. \"We were just panicking,\" she said. \"We run.\"\n\nA male companion said workers were told to evacuate their dorms.\n\n\"They announced it,\" he said of a new warning Thursday morning. \"All of the guests and employees should go outside for our safety.\"\n\nHe said he was frightened, \"a little bit, because we heard a lot of gunshots.\"\n\nThe law enforcement rangers, he said, \"they did their job.\"\n\nSeveral workers said they didn't want to talk.\n\n\"I don't want to relive it,\" one young man said. Nobody told him to avoid the media, he said.\n\n\"It's just me, personally,\" he said of his silence. \"Right now a lot of the employees are in the same boat.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" another worker said when asked about counseling and her mental health. But she, too, couldn't talk about the incident.\n\n\"I can't tell you something about that,\" she said.\n\nSydney Zulywitz found the event alien to a nature reserve. \"It was never something we considered,\" she said.\n\n\"It happened without warning,\" her friend Sydney Rich, another Canyon worker, said.\n\nZulywitz attended a counseling session offered by the Park Service and concessionaire Xanterra Travel Collection, which employees said lasted about 30 minutes.\n\nZulywitz said the experience was too raw to recount, begging off of recounting any details. She went to a counseling session, she said.\n\n\"I didn't know I needed it 'til I went and walked to the building,\" she said pointing to the Canyon Visitor Education Center where the sessions were offered.\n\n\"It was a big, big thing,\" Zulywitz said of the traumatic shooting. She, too, couldn't bring herself to go into details about what she witnessed.\n\nCounseling helped, she said, but recovery, \"it's going to take some time.\"\n\nA Canyon employee, who said his nickname was Emi, roomed next to Fussner. But, \"I didn't know him.\"\n\nHe said he and others usually do stretching exercises outside every morning. But that day he did them indoors because of orders.\n\n\"That was not good,\" he said, suggesting authorities might have done more to evacuate people. The park's statement Tuesday, however, underscored how law enforcement searched unsuccessfully for Fussner.\n\nEmi said he didn't feel safe.\n\n\"I haven't seen any improvement these two days,\" he said. \"More security guys, but that's it.\"\n\nTerrell Hollow lives in a dorm about 70 feet from the incident, he said, but slept in on his day off.\n\n\"It was crazy,\" he said of the story he heard when he woke.", "source": {"uri": "wyofile.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WyoFile"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_(contract)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concession (contract)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon_of_the_Yellowstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanterra_Travel_Collection", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xanterra Travel Collection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Canyon-070924.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716702", "eventUri": "eng-9716702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Sherman came out, was positively identified and detained.\n\nA ranger took Sherman to an office at the Lodge, and he remained there when a National Park Service agent and a U.S. Park Ranger arrived to interview him.\n\nA Lodge supervisor showed them an email stating that on July 5 Sherman was in the employee dining room, got into an argument and left saying something to the effect that \"'the next mass shooting will happen at Roosevelt.'\"\n\nBefore the interview with the NPS agent and the U.S. Park Ranger, Sherman waived his Miranda rights to speak to them. He also gave them written and verbal consent to search his cabin and vehicle. Nothing of note was found during the search, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nDuring the interview, Sherman admitted to the incident in the dining room where he violated a rule, and was reminded of that by another employee.\n\n\"'If anything I lost my cool,'\" then threw down his tray, he told the agent and ranger. On the way out of the dining room, he said, \"'maybe we should have a shooting down here as well.'\"\n\nSherman made the comment about 24 hours after the fatal officer-involved shooting of Xanterra employee Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner at Canyon Village less than 20 miles away from the Roosevelt Lodge.\n\nSherman is charged with one count of disorderly conduct, which is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail, not more than a $5,000 fine, not more than five years probation, and a $10 special assessment.\n\nCourt records did not indicate Sherman's home town, his age or other biographical details.\n\nHe is being held without bail, according to court records.\n\nFederal prosecutors filed a motion on Tuesday to detain Sherman until his trial, stating there is a serious risk he will flee, a serious risk of obstruction of justice, and a serious risk to the community. Prosecutors also wrote that detention will assure his appearance in court and the safety of any other person and the community.\n\nHe will have a formal detention hearing in three days, according to the motion.\n\nHe is scheduled to make his initial appearance to hear the charge at 11 a.m. Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick in federal court in Mammoth, Yellowstone National Park.", "source": {"uri": "oilcity.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil City News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_morton@oilcity.news", "name": "Tom Morton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Park ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherman, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sherman, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

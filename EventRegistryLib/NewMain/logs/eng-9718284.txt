National French Fry Day, that is.\n\nThe annual event happens each year on the second Friday in July, which makes it July 12 this year.\n\nFor years, the made-up holiday was held on July 13. But in 2022, fast-food chains Checkers and Rally's organized an online petition to get the National Day Calendar to move National French Fry Day so that it would always fall on a - wait for it - Fry-day.\n\nWhatever the day, french fries hold a special place in the appetite of most Americans. Only hamburgers rank above french fries, according to YouGov's regularly updated list of The Most Popular American Dishes. Hamburgers get an 85% popularity rating, while french fries get 84% (so does grilled cheese sandwiches).\n\nFrench fries rank highly on several media site Ranker polls including No. 1 as The Best Deep Fried Food and The Most Delicious Way To Eat Potatoes.\n\nMany restaurants have specials on french fries to celebrate the occasion - with Burger King, Jack in the Box, McDonald's and Wendy's having free fries on Friday for the rest of 2024. Here's a roundup of them, but remember to check the social media accounts of your local favorite food haunts and you may find more deals.\n\nGet the McDonald's app and get a deal for a free medium order of fries with any purchase of $1 or more on Friday, July 12, and every subsequent Friday through Dec. 27, 2024. When you download the McDonald's app, you also get a free Big Mac with your first purchase of $1 or more.\n\nThe restaurant chain also just launched Special Grade Garlic Sauce, which is available only in the app.\n\nOn National French Fry Day, members of the restaurant chain's Royal Perks loyalty program can get a free order of any size fries with a purchase of $1 or more - and every Friday for the rest of the year. From Friday to Sunday, July 12-14, Royal Perks members also get 2x Crowns in rewards with purchases containing fries.\n\nAnd, to celebrate July's designation as National Grilling Month, Royal Perks members can also get a free hamburger with a purchase of $1 or more on Friday, July 12.\n\nIf Taco Bell's Nacho Fries is your jam, through Monday, July 15, join the Taco Bell Rewards loyalty program and buy a Nacho Fries Lover's Pass for $10.

Of those 110 pounds, it is estimated that roughly 40 pounds of that consumption are in french fry form.\n\nAlthough those numbers are visually significant, Smith explained in his 2023 publication that potato consumption has decreased by 15% over the last 20 years, pointing specifically to the consumption of fresh potatoes over frozen or pre-prepared.\n\nDespite those declining numbers, restaurants locally and nationally are seizing the opportunity for promoting their own fried tubers on Friday for National French Fry Day.\n\nPenn Station will offer a free order of its fresh-cut fries on Friday and Saturday when promo code \"FRYDAY\" is used both in stores and online, according to a news release.\n\nWendy's is offering a free order of fries with purchase of another menu item every Friday through the remainder of the year for customers using the Wendy's app.\n\nMcDonald's has branded its Free Fry Fridays for McDonald's app users, where you can redeem the weekly promotion on Friday for a free medium size order of fries with any purchase over $1.\n\nWhich french fry do you prefer?

The offer will be loaded onto the mobile ordering application via Android or iPhone when the special holiday arrives.\n\nPeople who do not have the app can download it before Friday - and receive a free Whataburger. That means you can save the free burger offer and combine it with the free fries on Friday.\n\nOther restaurants have gotten in on the free fry deals as well, such as Wendy's and McDonald's who offer free fries every Friday through the end of the year with purchase via their mobile apps.\n\nThe \"Fry-day\" holiday originally was celebrated each July 13, but it was moved after 33,000-plus people signed a petition seeking to anchor it to Friday.

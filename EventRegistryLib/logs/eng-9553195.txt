And that the company \"anticipates\" that this new Middle-earth film will \"release in 2026.\"\n\nZaslav also revealed that the genius behind the first set of live-action The Lord of the Rings movies, Peter Jackson, will return for these new films.

Tolkien books. The projects will be developed through WB label New Line Cinema. Freemode, a division of Embracer Group, made the adaptive rights deal for books including \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" under a venture named Middle-earth Enterprises.\n\nA separate, animated Middle-earth movie, \"The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,\" is due on Dec. 13 via Warner Bros. and director Kenji Kamiyama. That movie is set 200 years before the events of \"The Hobbit.\"\n\n\"For over two decades, moviegoers have embraced the 'Lord of the Rings' film trilogy because of the undeniable devotion Peter, Fran and Philippa have shown towards protecting the legacy of Tolkien's works, and to ensure audiences could experience the incredible world he created in a way that honors his literary vision,\" De Luca and Abdy said in a statement Thursday. \"We are honored they have agreed be our partners on these two new films.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, and arrives two decades after the nearly $6 billion film franchise was first introduced to audiences.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav has just announced a new The Lord of the Rings movie set to come out in 2026.\n\nPeter Jackson, famed director of the much-loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy of films, as well as the Hobbit movies, returns alongside co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens to produce on the untitled film. Zaslav said all three \"will be involved every step of the way.\" An early script is in development.\n\nDuring an investor call, Zaslav said this new movie \"will explore storylines yet to be told\", before adding that The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and the DC Universe are all franchises he considers to be \"largely underused.\" \"We are hard at work fixing that,\" he said. No further details on the film were shared.\n\nAmazon has continued The Lord of the Rings with its The Rings of Power TV show, Season 1 of which released in 2022 on Prime Video. Amazon announced it would renew the show for a second season before Season 1 even came out, with Season 2 set to premiere this year. In our review of the first season of The Rings of Power, IGN said: \"Prime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power captures the epic scope and beauty of Tolkien's work.\"\n\nIn February, showrunners Patrick McKay and JD Payne extended their partnership with Amazon, signing a new three-year deal with the company and kicking off early work on Season 3.\n\nElsewhere in Tolkien's world sits The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, which is an animated film set to tell the story behind the fortress of Helm's Deep and the mighty King of Rohan Helm Hammerhand when it premieres on December 13, 2024.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings video games are back in full swing too, despite the disastrous launch of 2023's Gollum. Franchise owner Embracer Group said it needs to be \"exploiting Lord of the Rings in a very significant fashion\" by turning it into \"one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world\".\n\nGames in development at the moment include a The Lord of the Rings massively multiplayer online game from Amazon Games, which was in early development as of May 2023, and a cozy life simulator called Tales of the Shire.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Bilbo Baggins felt that was the theme of his life in The Hobbit, and now life is reflecting art. We are all going there and back again to the world of The Lord of the Rings. In early 2023, we learned that new live-action The Lord of the Rings movies were in the works at Warner Bros. Discovery. And now, our most recent updates reveal that Peter Jackson will once again craft these fantasy films. Additionally, we will see these new live-action The Lord of the Rings movies sooner than we think. The first of the new The Lord of the Rings films will release in 2026. (Yes, that's 2026, not 2006, we had to check too.) It will be titled Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum and will focus on Andy Serkis' Gollum.\n\nAs to what story this new The Lord of the Rings movie will tell? Well, Zaslav initially noted that it will \"explore storylines yet to be told.\" That could mean many things. But we certainly have a few ideas of what The Lord of the Rings tales we'd like to see on-screen. However, per Variety, the working title of the movie is \"Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum\" and will star Andy Serkis' Gollum. Andy Serkis will also direct the movie.\n\n\"Yesssss, Precious,\" Shared Serkis, \"The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle Earth Peter, Fran and Philippa. With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our filmmaking family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\"\n\nZaslav additionally noted, \"Lord of the Rings' is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for theatrical business.\" With a 2026 release date, we guess we'll hear more about these The Lord of the Rings movies sooner rather than later.\n\nZaslav also revealed that the genius behind the first set of live-action The Lord of the Rings movies, Peter Jackson, will return for these new films. He notes that Peter Jackson and his writing partners, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens \"will be involved every step of the way.\" The trio is producing the movie.\n\nJackson, Walsh, and Boyens noted, \"It is an honour and a privilege to travel back to Middle-earth with our good friend and collaborator, Andy Serkis, who has unfinished business with that Stinker -- Gollum! As life long fans of Professor Tolkien's vast mythology, we are proud to be working with Mike De Luca, Pam Abdy and the entire team at Warner Bros. on another epic adventure!\"\n\nDuring Warner Bros. Discovery's first-quarter earnings conference call, which we first saw on Variety, CEO David Zaslav dropped the precious news. He shared that Warner Bros. Discovery is \"now in the early stages of script development\" for the first of the new The Lord of the Rings movies. And that the company \"anticipates\" that this new Middle-earth film will \"release in 2026.\"", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bilbo Baggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Zaslav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery's first-quarter earnings, according to The Hollywood Reporter. In the meeting, CEO David Zaslav revealed that the company is \"now in the early stages of script development\" for a new batch of Lord Of The Rings films, which will \"explore storylines yet to be told.\"\n\nThe first of them has the working title Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, and, as the title suggests, will centre around Andy Serkis' Gollum.\n\nPeter Jackon, the filmmaker behind the original trilogy, will be producing the movie alongside Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh, and is expected to be \"involved every step of the way\" according to Zaslav. It is set to be released in cinemas in 2026.\n\nAt time of writing, the project is currently in early stages of script development, and is being worked on by writers Walsh and Boyens, along with Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou. Serkis is expected to return to his iconic titular role, and will also be taking on the role of director.\n\nNews of the new LOTR projects arose last year, when Warner Bros. announced that studio leaders Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy had made a deal to create \"multiple\" movies based on the J.R.R. Tolkien novels.\n\nAccording to Variety, the films are going to be developed through WB label New Line Cinema, and Freemode - a division of Embracer Group - who made the adaptive rights deal for books including The Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit under Middle-earth Enterprises.\n\nIn a statement shared today, De Luca and Abdy said: \"For over two decades, moviegoers have embraced the Lord of the Rings film trilogy because of the undeniable devotion Peter, Fran and Philippa have shown towards protecting the legacy of Tolkien's works, and to ensure audiences could experience the incredible world he created in a way that honours his literary vision.\n\n\"We are honoured they have agreed be our partners on these two new films. With Andy coming aboard to direct Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, we continue an important commitment to excellence that is a true hallmark of how we all want to venture ahead and further contribute to the Lord of the Rings cinematic history.\"\n\nJackson, Walsh and Boyens added: \"It is an honour and a privilege to travel back to Middle-earth with our good friend and collaborator, Andy Serkis, who has unfinished business with that Stinker -- Gollum! As lifelong fans of Professor Tolkien's vast mythology, we are proud to be working with Mike De Luca, Pam Abdy and the entire team at Warner Bros. on another epic adventure!\"\n\nFinally, Serkis also shared his own statement, which read: \"The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle Earth Peter, Fran and Philippa. With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our filmmaking family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\"\n\nSince their release, the films - which starred Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler and more - have collectively grossed almost $3billion globally. The follow-up trilogy based on The Hobbit went on to match those figures.\n\nThe franchise made the transition to TV with Amazon's The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power in 2022. A second season went into development last year, and is predicted to arrive towards the end of 2024.\n\nIn other LOTR news, last summer it was reported that the soundtrack for The Lord Of The Rings trilogy had been voted the best film music by the UK public - beating out competition from John Williams' scores for Schindler's List and Star Wars, which placed in second and third respectively.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liberty_dunworth@nme.com", "name": "Liberty Dunworth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_De_Luca", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael De Luca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Zaslav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens are set to write the screenplay, along with Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou (Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim).\n\nLord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum in Familiar Hands\n\nThe news was announced during Warner Bros. Discovery's first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday, where CEO David Zaslav revealed the plans going forward, having previously noted the company was mulling over more films in the franchise.\n\n\"Lord of the Rings is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for our theatrical business,\" said Zaslav in the call.\n\nJackson will be joined by longtime writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, who \"will all be involved every step of the way.\" with a view to a 2026 release.\n\nThis will be no reboot or reimagining, but rather, it will \"explore storylines yet to be told\" in Middle Earth.

It will be released in 2026.\n\nToday, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that we aren't just returning to the world of Lord of the Rings, and Middle Earth won't be just in animation. Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim takes place centuries before the events of the books and is a film we have learned almost nothing about so far, though it is set to come out later this year. Now we know that Warner Bros. is also bringing Lord of the Rings back into live action. In a press release sent out today to various media outlets (via Deadline), the studio announced that a new film was in the works, which will be directed and star Andy Serkis. The working title at the moment is Lord of the Rings: The Hunt For Gollum, and it will be released in 2026, so not that far away. Franchise mainstays Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens will be producing and heavily involved with the project. Walsh and Boyens are set to write the script along with Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou, both of whom worked on The War of the Rohirrim, so Warner Bros. and everyone involved must be happy with everything they are seeing with that thus far. This is also confirmed to be the first of two new Lord of the Rings films.\n\nNew Lord Of The Rings Stories In Live-Action\n\nVarious people within Warner Bros. upper management and those involved with The Hunt For Gollum shared their thoughts in the press release, which are listed below:\n\nSaid Warner Bros. Motion Pictures heads Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy, \"For over two decades, moviegoers have embraced the Lord of the Rings film trilogy because of the undeniable devotion Peter, Fran, and Philippa have shown towards protecting the legacy of Tolkien's works, and to ensure audiences could experience the incredible world he created in a way that honors his literary vision. We are honored they have agreed to be our partners on these two new films. With Andy coming aboard to direct Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum(*WT), we continue an important commitment to excellence that is a true hallmark of how we all want to venture ahead and further contribute to the Lord of the Rings cinematic history.\"\n\nSaid Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens: \"It is an honour and a privilege to travel back to Middle-earth with our good friend and collaborator, Andy Serkis, who has unfinished business with that Stinker - Gollum! As lifelong fans of Professor Tolkien's vast mythology, we are proud to be working with Mike De Luca, Pam Abdy, and the entire team at Warner Bros. on another epic adventure!\"\n\nAnd Serkis said -- \"Yesssss, Precious. The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle Earth: Peter, Fran, and Philippa. With Mike and Pam and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our film-making family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\"\n\nThe reaction to this news will be controversial, to say the least. While the original trilogy is one of those rare examples of miracle film-making, the second trilogy is a walking example of everything that can be done wrong when you try to make lightning strike twice. The one-off animated film seemed like a good idea because it was so unattached to anything related to the previous films, but this is still very much connected to familiar characters, timelines, and locations. Perhaps the tune around this will change once December rolls around. If The War of the Rohirrim ends up good, but right now, the last taste many still have of Lord of the Rings on the big screen is a bloated trilogy of films that was a constant reminder of the greed of studio executives as they tried to milk The Hobbit for every penny that they could. Warner Bros. does not have anyone's sword, axe, or bow at the moment, but that could change in December.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlyn_booth@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Kaitlyn Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_War_of_the_Rohirrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Working title"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Summary Warner Bros. is working on a new Lord of the Rings movie that could arrive in 2026. The project is currently in the early script stage. More recent Lord of the Rings projects have struggled to recapture the magic of Peter Jackson's original trilogy. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nWarner Bros. has a new Lord of the Rings movie in the works, and it already has a tentative release window. Adapting J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy novel series, Peter Jackson's first acclaimed Lord of the Rings trilogy was released from 2001 to 2003. The filmmaker would subsequently return to the world of Middle-earth with his more divisive Hobbit trilogy in the 2010s. Since then, new projects in the franchise have included The Rings of Power on Prime Video and an upcoming anime movie, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.\n\nNow, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav reveals during a recent earnings call (via Variety) that a new batch of TheLord of the Rings movies is in development. The first of these movies, which is said to be in the early script stage, could be released as early as 2026. Jackson and his writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens are serving as producers on the movie and are said to be fairly heavily involved. Story details were not revealed, but Zaslav said the film will \"explore storylines yet to be told.\"\n\nMore to come...\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is a multimedia franchise consisting of several movies and a TV show released by Amazon titled The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The franchise is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's book series that began in 1954 with The Fellowship of the Ring. The Lord of the Rings saw mainstream popularity with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.\n\nMovie(s) The Lord of the Rings (1978) , The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring , The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers , The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey , The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug , The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies , The Lord of The Rings: The War of The Rohirrim Created by J.R.R.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav has just announced a new The Lord of the Rings movie set to come out in 2026.\n\nFamed director Peter Jackson returns alongside co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens to produce on the untitled film. Zaslav said all three \"will be involved every step of the way.\" An early script is in development.\n\nDuring an investor call, Zaslav said this new movie \"will explore storylines yet to be told\", before adding that The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and the DC Universe are all franchises he considers to be \"largely underused.\" \"We are hard at work fixing that,\" he said. No further details on the film were shared.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery has continued The Lord of the Rings with its The Rings of Power TV show, Season 1 of which released in 2022 on Prime Video. Creator Amazon announced it would renew the show for a second season before Season 1 even premiered, which is set to premiere sometime this year. In our review of the first season of The Rings of Power, IGN said: \"Prime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power captures the epic scope and beauty of Tolkien's work.\"\n\nIn February, showrunners Patrick McKay and JD Payne extended their partnership with Amazon, signing a new three-year deal with the company and kicking off early work on Season 3.\n\nElsewhere in Tolkien's world sits The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, which is an animated film set to tell the story behind the fortress of Helm's Deep and the mighty King of Rohan Helm Hammerhand when it premieres on December 13, 2024.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings video games are back in full swing too, despite the disastrous launch of 2023's Gollum. Franchise owner Embracer Group said it needs to be \"exploiting Lord of the Rings in a very significant fashion\" by turning it into \"one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world\".\n\nGames in development at the moment include a The Lord of the Rings massively multiplayer online game from Amazon Games, which was in early development as of May 2023, and a cozy life simulator called Tales of the Shire.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Using familiar characters can be tricky, so any future adaptations must ensure they serve the story instead of being included for nostalgia. Embracing time jumps and making (small) changes from the source material keeps the Lord of the Rings franchise fresh and engaging.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise is gearing up for a major revival in the realm of cinema. It has been a decade since the last Lord of the Rings film, Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, hit theaters, and audiences are ready and excited for a return to Middle-Earth. The next new Lord of the Rings film set to hit theaters is The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, a big-budget animated film that takes visual inspiration from many classic and revered anime films. That movie, which features Brian Cox as the voice of its lead character (Helm Hammerhand) and the return of Miranda Otto as the voice of \u00c9owyn, is set to hit theaters this December.\n\nAs Warner Bros. intends to build The Lord of the Rings into a major and active film franchise similar to Star Wars, this new animated feature will serve as a reintroduction to Middle Earth on the big screen. It is not, however, the first time that audiences have returned to Tolkien's iconic world in the last decade. Prime Video's live-action series, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, has also delved into the epic stories of Middle-Earth's Second Age with a 10-episode debut season in 2022 and a second likely to release sometime this year.\n\nThe Rings of Power caused quite a stir among both casual and die-hard Lord of the Rings fans upon its release. With that in mind, there are a handful of important lessons that WB can learn from the series while producing its new slate of upcoming Middle-Earth films. Here are some of the most important.\n\nThe Atmosphere of Lord of the Rings Matters Close\n\nNo matter how they felt about the story and writing of the series, one of the core aspects that no Rings of Power viewer could deny is how beautiful the show was. The Prime Video series absolutely nailed the feel of Middle-Earth and the overall atmosphere of The Lord of the Rings. This wasn't just through its cinematography - which was excellent - but it was also the result of the incredibly detailed and ornate sets and costume design. On top of that, there was gorgeous music composed by Bear McCreary and Howard Shore, with Shore returning to compose the title theme while McCreary handled everything else.\n\nThe result of all of this was a series that radiated Tolkien in every frame and sound. Many fans of the series were willing to forgive some of its other lacking qualities simply because it felt so good to return to this world in such a beautiful fashion. If WB wants these new Lord of the Rings films to succeed, preserving this atmosphere must be a major priority. If these movies don't have the same kind of special aura about them as The Rings of Power or Jackson's original films from the early 2000s, fans are more likely to reject them altogether.\n\nUsing Familiar Lord of the Rings Characters Can Be Tricky Close\n\nHollywood is currently in an era defined by legacy sequels, which bring back essentially as many familiar faces from previous films as possible. A few notable examples of this are the Star Wars sequel trilogy, the new Ghostbusters films, and Jurassic World: Dominion. With that in mind, the temptation to bring back familiar faces from Jackson's Lord of the Rings or Hobbit movies will undoubtedly be present. However, when developing these new movies, WB needs to consider if bringing familiar actors or characters back best serves the story being told.\n\nRelated The Lords of the Rings: The Rings of Power - 7 Things the Prime Video Series Got Right Contrary to what some people may say online, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power has actually done a lot of things really well.\n\nThere is a right way to bring characters back, which has been demonstrated to some degree in The Rings of Power. Primarily, the show has brought back the likes of Elrond and Galadriel, played in the series by Robert Aramayo and Morfydd Clark. What works about that decision is that these characters are central to the story of the Second Age and are not included purely for nostalgia or familiarity. If characters are brought back simply for the sake of having a familiar face, it often feels out of place or distracting. An excellent example of this is the inclusion of Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins at the beginning of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. While it may have been nice to see Wood's Frodo again, he ultimately didn't serve the story and was more of a distraction than anything else.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Films Shouldn't Shy Away From Time Jumps Close\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the last two to some degree. The world and stories of Middle-Earth are vast. There are countless tales, legends, and histories baked into Tolkien's Legendarium that would make for outstanding films. Even though the two most famous stories, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, are relatively close to one another in the overall Middle-Earth timeline, that does not mean that these new films must stick to that same period. While films about a young Aragorn or the War of the Dwarves and Orcs would be interesting, there is far more potential in the Lord of the Rings franchise when it is opened up to the Ages preceding that time.\n\nThe Rings of Power has shown that audiences are more than willing to follow the Lord of the Rings franchise to Ages far before the original story. The story of the Prime Video series is set in the Second Age, which is thousands of years before the adventures of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. This change has allowed the series to operate on its own terms much more easily than if it had to be concerned too closely with those better-known stories.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Should Be Willing to Differ From the Source Material Close\n\nWhen adapting any story from one medium to another, changes inevitably need to be made. This isn't a bad thing. While it may annoy or even anger some of the most die-hard fans, alterations to a story when bringing it to film can often have immensely beneficial effects. Some of this year's most universally praised epics, Dune: Part Two and Sh\u014dgun, are both based on famous novels and make some pretty substantial changes to the source material. Making changes to better suit the material for its new medium is crucial, and it allows the creatives behind the story to tackle the story more purely in what they want.\n\nRelated Lord of the Rings: Why Changes to Tolkien's Lore are Necessary for The Rings of Power The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power has been criticized for changing the details of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth, but change can be necessary.\n\nThe most important thing when adapting a story is being able to walk the line between making necessary changes and keeping the core of the material alive in the process. Most fans will accept substantial changes to a story as long as the heart and intent of the original work are kept intact. The Rings of Power has shown this in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe series does make some pretty significant changes to Tolkien's original story. For the fans who still believe the heart of Tolkien's writing is at the core of the show, The Rings of Power can be an incredible experience. However, for the fans who feel the show has strayed too far, the show can feel like an imitation of The Lord of the Rings rather than an adaptation.\n\nWarner Bros. Should Be Aware of Fan Expectations Close\n\nFinally, one of the biggest things WB needs to be aware of when developing these new Lord of the Rings films is how active, passionate, and divided the franchise's fan base has become. While this isn't explicitly the result of The Rings of Power, the release of that series showcased how prominent these internal divisions had become. At this point, the fan base of the series feels very similar to that of Star Wars, in which everybody has very different and passionate opinions on what needs to be done with the series, so no new film or series is going to please 100% of the fan base.\n\nWhile WB shouldn't be catering to every whim of the loudest sect of the Lord of the Rings fan base, the creatives behind these new films need to be aware of fans' various desires and expectations. While there was a lot of negativity surrounding the release of The Rings of Power, not all the complaints are without merit. There are lessons to be learned from the divisiveness of the Prime Video series, both in terms of what works and what doesn't for The Lord of the Rings in a modern context. The tough job is to separate valid criticisms from just relentless complaining that will never be appeased. The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogy are streaming on Max. The Rings of Power is streaming on Prime Video.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohan,_Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohan, Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The WB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Jackson's trilogy starred Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen and Cate Blanchett and won 17 Academy Awards. In 2022, fans were able to revisit Middle Earth thanks to the Amazon series Lord of the Rings: The Ring of Power.\n\nIt was set thousands of years before the events of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings took place. The series broke records as it was dubbed the most expensive TV show ever to be made. The epic eight part series Rings of Power set the global company back \u00a3209m million just for the rights alone and \u00a347 million per episode.\n\nThe original three Lord of the Rings films from 2001-2003 covered the novel J.R.R Tolkien toiled over for 12 years. But The Rings of Power, developed by screenwriters JD Payne and Patrick McKay, is based on a 150-page collection of fictional histories Tolkien created called The Silmarillion.\n\nLike the original trilogy, the show was initially filmed in New Zealand and took viewers back to the era in which the kingdoms rose to glory before falling to ruin. The reaction to the trilogy was mixed - but that's always the way with much loved book to screen adaptations. There's the familiar age-old clash of devoted buffs admonishing anything that doesn't strictly follow the original story, while others will enjoy the new series for what it is.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_o_hare@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mia O'Hare", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Zaslav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery announced that a new Lord Of The Rings movie is set for 2026\n\nLast year, Andy Serkis said he would happily return to Middle-earth if Peter Jackson and his co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens were involved. Seems he's gotten his wish, and then some: Warner Bros. Discovery announced on Thursday that Jackson would produce a new Lord Of The Rings film, directed by and starring Serkis (via Deadline). On WBD's quarterly earnings call, CEO David Zaslav said the studio is aiming for a 2026 release of the new movie, which is currently titled Lord Of The Rings: The Hunt For Gollum.\n\nAt the moment, the studio is developing two adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's work, the first of which is \"now in the early stages of script development,\" according to Zaslav. The Hunt For Gollum will be written by Walsh, Boyens, and Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou (writers of the WBD animated LOTR film, Lord Of The Rings: The War Of The Rohirrim). Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens released a joint statement (via Deadline) saying, \"It is an honour and a privilege to travel back to Middle-earth with our good friend and collaborator, Andy Serkis, who has unfinished business with that Stinker -- Gollum! As life long fans of Professor Tolkien's vast mythology, we are proud to be working with Mike De Luca, Pam Abdy and the entire team at Warner Bros. on another epic adventure!\"\n\nIn his own statement, Serkis -- who previously directed Mowgli: Legend Of The Jungle and Venom: Let There Be Carnage -- said, \"Yesssss, Precious. The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle Earth Peter, Fran and Philippa. With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our film making family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\".\n\nZaslav first announced that Warner Bros. Discovery would make more LOTR last year, but it's been on his radar since the beginning of his tenure. In November 2022, six months after assuming the throne, Zaslav put emphasis on WB's IP: \"Batman, Superman, Aquaman, if we can do something with JK on Harry Potter going forward, Lord Of The Rings, what are we doing with Game Of Thrones? What are we doing with a lot of the big franchises that we have? We're focused on franchises.\" Now, two years later, Zaslav is still ringing the same bell with this announcement: \"Lord of the Rings is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for our theatrical business,\" he said on Thursday's earnings call (via The Hollywood Reporter).\n\nThe new Warner Bros. Lord Of The Rings spin-off is, of course, not related to and not to be confused with Amazon Prime Video's (intended) television franchise, Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power. The intellectual property rights situation is a little bit messy. Warner Bros. Discovery, through its subsidiary New Line Cinema, has a deal with Middle-earth Enterprises (a subdivision of the Embracer Freemode division of Embracer Group, a Swedish video game and media holding company). Middle-earth Enterprises specifically holds the film rights to The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings, and therefore the rights to most of Tolkien's most recognizable characters, including, yes, Gollum.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon obtained its rights directly from the Tolkien estate, and it has access to the same works (Hobbit and LOTR) for television. But Amazon also has the exclusive rights to the Appendices and anything to do with the Second Age of Middle-earth (LOTR is set in the Third Age). To make its own mark and create its own franchise, The Rings Of Power focused on the Second Age and a cast of mostly new characters. As a result, the television show (the most expensive television show of all time) didn't really have the cultural impact that the LOTR film trilogy did. Basically, Serkis has a huge leg up on the competition by helming a movie that's a direct continuation of the hugely popular and culturally significant films. Whether the market becomes oversaturated with Tolkien content, well, that remains to be seen....", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Discovery announced it was officially developing a new Lord of the Rings movie, Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum.\n\nThe film will mark the first live-action Lord of the Rings movie in a decade. It comes at just the right time, as the franchise has recently made a significant comeback. First, Amazon released the live-action TV series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which is loosely based on J. R. R. Tolkien's work. Meanwhile, Warner Bros. actually already has another movie in the works with the animated The Lord of the Rings: The War of Rohirrim set to premiere on December 13, 2024.\n\nThe first indication of a new live-action movie came when Warner Bros. secured a deal with the rights holders Embracer Group AB a year ago. Many were curious whether the studio intended to remake the original films or create new stories in Middle-earth, similar to The Rings of Power and The War of Rohirrim. There was also quite a bit of skepticism, as few believe any adaptation could ever top Peter Jackson's original trilogy. Now, Warner Bros. has finally unveiled its plans for the new movie.\n\nWarner Bros. is planning multiple films set in the Lord of the Rings franchise, but the first one to roll out will be Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. The film is aiming for a 2026 release date, although it is still in the very early stages of development. According to the studio, the script for the movie is currently being worked on.\n\nGollum is one of the most beloved Lord of the Rings characters, as the fallen Stoor Hobbit who yearns endlessly for The Ring. He was even further popularized by Andy Serkis, who brought the character to life by providing his voice and motion capture for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. For many fans, Gollum wouldn't be the same without Serkis, which is why it's so exciting that Serkis is returning to portray the character and direct the movie. While he is most well known for his critically acclaimed motion capture acting, Serkis made his directorial debut in 2017 with Breathe and went on to direct Venom: Let There Be Carnage. His understanding of motion capture work and the character Gollum bodes well for the film.\n\nIn addition to Serkis, Peter Jackson is returning as a producer on The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum along with The Lord of the Rings original screenwriters Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh. In a statement, Serkis said of the new movie:\n\nYesssss, Precious. The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle-earth Peter, Fran and Philippa,\" added Serkis. \"With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our film making family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\n\nAside from Serkis, no casting announcements have been made for The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. Also, no plot details have been released at this time. While the film will obviously focus on a solo Gollum story, it's unclear what material the movie is adapting or drawing inspiration from. However, internet users have a theory about the plot. In The Lord of the Rings book, there is mention of how Aragorn once managed to capture Gollum and tried to take him to Mirkwood before he escaped. Hence, many users theorize that the movie will focus on Aragorn and Gollum, leading to excitement about a potential recasting of Aragorn and Gandalf, who was also a part of that story.\n\nGiven that Peter Jackson has already adapted the full books, it wouldn't be surprising if the movie settled on smaller arcs or even just anecdotes scattered throughout the book to explore. However, for now, the Aragorn/Mirkwood arc is just a theory. Further details on The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum's plot and casting should be forthcoming as production draws closer.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_ulatowski@themarysue.com", "name": "Rachel Ulatowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohan,_Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohan, Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. has confirmed in its latest earnings call that a whole new batch of The Lord of the Rings movies is on the way, with Andy Serkis' movie based on the famous character of Gollum possibly leading the way. WB CEO David Zaslav confirmed that the first of the new films will be released in 2026.\n\nThe original filmmaker of the famed trilogy, Peter Jackson, will produce this upcoming Gollum film, which currently has the working title The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. Jackson's partners, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, are also among the producers.\n\nThe most intriguing factor is that Andy Serkis, who shot to fame with his portrayal of Gollum in the original trilogy, will now take the director's role in the upcoming adaptation. Reports have not yet confirmed whether he will also star as the titular character, but that is the most plausible outcome.\n\nThe movie is reportedly in the early stages of development, with Walsh and Boyens currently working on the script.\n\nEverything we know about The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum\n\nSimply put, we have very little idea about The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum and where it will take viewers. For one, the title is not yet fixed. Moreover, very little detail is available about the team behind the project.\n\nIt was announced earlier in 2023 that studio leaders Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy will look over the extensive new set of movies based on J.R.R. Tolkien's famous work. Like the rest of the new LOTR movies, WB's label, New Line Cinema, will produce the new project.\n\n\"For over two decades, moviegoers have embraced the 'Lord of the Rings' film trilogy because of the undeniable devotion Peter, Fran and Philippa have shown towards protecting the legacy of Tolkien's works, and to ensure audiences could experience the incredible world he created in a way that honors his literary vision,\" De Luca and Abdy said in a statement.\n\nThe statement further added:\n\n\"We are honored they have agreed be our partners on these two new films. With Andy coming aboard to direct 'Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum,' we continue an important commitment to excellence that is a true hallmark of how we all want to venture ahead and further contribute to the 'Lord of the Rings' cinematic history.\"\n\nIn a more fun addition, Andy Serkis said:\n\n\"Yesssss, Precious...The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle Earth Peter, Fran and Philippa. With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our filmmaking family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\"\n\nAll in all, this seems like an exciting project that will bear fruit for the franchise. As for Andy Serkis leading the project, the actor already has experience in direction after his work on Venom: Let There Be Carnage.

Website http://www.lordoftherings.net Franchise The Lord of the Rings\n\nThe news that new Lord of the Rings were in development first dropped back in February 2023, with Peter Jackson saying, \"Warner Brothers and Embracer have kept us in the loop every step of the way. We look forward to speaking with them further to hear their vision for the franchise moving forward.\" Evidently, he liked what the studio had to say.\n\nThis latest update comes following the revelation that Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav are hoping to transform the saga of Middle-earth into a Star Wars-style franchise. Revealed in previous reports, Warner Bros. Discovery will follow in the modern cinematic footsteps of several major studios and \"circling its wagons ever tighter around familiar IP\" with focus being put on brands such as DC and the \"hopes to turn LOTR into a Star Wars-like franchise.\"\n\nRelated 11 Biggest Mistakes in Peter Jackson's LotR Movies As highly acclaimed as Peter Jackson's LotR films were, there were still plot holes and filming errors in them. Here are 20 of the worst ones.\n\nBased on the novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, Jackson helmed the lauded trilogy beginning with The Fellowship of the Ring in 2001, followed by The Two Towers in 2002, and The Return of the King in 2003. Starring an ensemble cast that includes Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving, and Andy Serkis all three installments in the trilogy were major cinematic events.\n\nThe films all received critical acclaim, winning 17 Academy Awards out of 30 total nominations, and are now deemed to be one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time. Can a new movie exploring untold stories set in Middle-earth ever live up to such a legacy?\n\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise has since expanded, with The Hobbit trilogy lighting up the big screen from 2012 to 2014. The stories have now moved onto the small screen, with The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power gearing up to debut its second season on Prime Video later this year. An animated movie, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, will bring the IP back to theaters on December 13, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The trilogy directed by Jackson -- \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001), \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002) and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003) -- grossed $3 billion combined.\n\nAbout a decade later, Jackson directed a three-part movie series based on Tolkien's \"The Hobbit.\" Amazon Prime Video released the Middle-earth show \"The Rings of Power\" in 2022.\n\nThe announcement of two new \"Lord of the Rings\" movies comes as David Zaslav, the chief executive of the studio's parent company, faces criticism for receiving $49.7 million in compensation last year despite the company's financial troubles.

But it is not real and uses AI-generated footage to project Tom Holland's face on Elijah Wood's Frodo. It also presents Jacob Batalon as Sam, replacing Sean Astin's face with his.\n\nWatch the trailer here:\n\nThe trailer was published on the KH Studio YouTube channel on May 5. The channel is known to create concept trailers using old footage from past movies and other deepfake AI shots. As described by the channel, its trailer for The Lord of the Rings (2025) is another example of this. But no live-action Lord of the Rings movie has been put in development, so it cannot arrive in 2025.\n\nWill Tom Holland and Jacob Batalon appear in The Lord of the Rings (2025)?\n\nTom Holland and Jacob Batalon will not appear in The Lord of the Rings (2025) as no such movie was greenlit. Instead, the two actors will reunite in Sony's Spider-Man 4 for the MCU. Meanwhile, there are other Lord of the Rings projects in development.\n\n2024 will see the launch of an animated prequel movie titled The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.

Peter Jackson will produce the new film and be involved every step of the way, along with writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. The franchise has been a massive success at the box office, with each film in the original trilogy grossing over $300 million domestically and The Return of the King earning over $1.1 billion worldwide.\n\nNow 10 years removed from the last installment in the franchise, Middle Earth is officially returning to the big screen. During a Warner Bros. Discovery earnings call on Thursday, May 9, CEO David Zaslav revealed that the studio is developing a new Lord of the Rings film, which will be titled The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, and is set to release in 2026. The next installment will reportedly be the first in a batch of new films, and Andy Serkis will return to reprise his role as Gollum and direct the film. Zaslav also confirmed that the legendary Peter Jackson, who has written and directed all six entries in the Lord of the Rings franchise to date, will produce and \"be involved every step of the way.\" His writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens will also produce and work with Jackson on the film.\n\nWhen talking about the franchise as a whole, Zaslav said, \"Lord of the Rings is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for theatrical business.\" The most recent outing for the franchise was Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, the Prime Video series created by Patrick McKay and John D. Payne, which received mostly positive reviews from critics and was divisive among fans.

Each film in the original trilogy between 2001-2003 grossed over $300 million at the domestic box office, and the most of which, The Return of the King, went on to earn $763 million internationally to amass a worldwide total of more than $1.1 billion. The more recent trilogy, The Hobbit, also made waves at the box office, with each film grossing between $950 million and just over $1 billion at the worldwide box office. The franchise has proven itself to be a cash cow, and Warner Bros. is returning to the well to collect what's sure to be another hefty check.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum will release in 2026. Stay tuned to Collider for future updates. The original trilogy is streaming on various platforms, including Hulu.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring PG-13 AdventureActionFantasyDrama\n\nA meek Hobbit from the Shire and eight companions set out on a journey to destroy the powerful One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron.\n\nRelease Date December 19, 2001 Director Peter Jackson Cast Elijah Wood , Ian McKellen , Orlando Bloom , Sean Bean , Alan Howard , Sean Astin , Andy Serkis , Viggo Mortensen Runtime 178 minutes Main Genre Adventure\n\nWatch on Hulu", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_blevins@collider.com", "name": "Adam Blevins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The new film is likely a prequel following Gollum in the years before The Lord of the Rings Details on the cast and story are scarce, but the movie is set for a 2026 release and may see Serkis reprise his role as Gollum.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's classic epic fantasy series The Lord of the Rings is returning in an all-new slate of spinoff movies, the first of which being the newly-announced The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. Beginning with the publication of The Hobbit in 1937, English author J.R.R. Tolkien established the fictional realm of Middle-Earth and populated it with some of the most beloved fantasy characters and adventures in literary history. Expanding across his trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, throughout the 1950s, Tolkien is very much responsible for the way fantasy stories are told.\n\nNaturally, the entire Middle-Earth saga made for gripping entertainment, and it didn't take long for the series to be adapted into various animated films, live-action films, games, and TV shows. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy redefined the blockbuster in the early 2000s when it raked in high profits at the box office and won a slew of Oscars. Though Jackson's Hobbit series faltered, interest has remained high in Middle-Earth content across the years and a brand-new spinoff movie is in the work entitled The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum.\n\nStream On Max\n\nThe Lord Of The Rings: The Hunt For Gollum Is Confirmed\n\nA New Lord Of The Rings Movie Series Is Planned\n\nthe likelihood of Serkis not reprising his role as the twisted former Hobbit seems quite low.\n\nNot long after it was revealed that plans were in place to expand the franchise, it was announced that The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum was in development. The reveal of the planned off-shoot of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy comes two decades after the release of Return of the King in 2003, and will see Andy Serkis take on a new role as the film's director. Serkis is perhaps most famous for playing the titular character in the original trilogy but his career has blossomed beyond motion-capture roles.\n\nAndy Serkis has already directed several films including 2021's Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\n\nThe news of the movie was revealed by Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav in an earning call in early May 2024, and it comes hot on the heels of other major shifts in the epic Middle-Earth franchise. The Hunt for Gollum is slated for a 2026 release, though a more concrete date is still elusive. Few details are known about the movie at this time, and it isn't clear if Serkis will be playing Gollum again or merely directing. However, considering it was his starmaking role, the likelihood of Serkis not reprising his role as the twisted former Hobbit seems quite low.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings cinematic franchise consists of:\n\nMovie\n\nRelease Year\n\nNote\n\nThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\n\n2012\n\nTakes place 60 years before The Lord of the Rings\n\nThe Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\n\n2013\n\nPicks up immediately after An Unexpected Journey\n\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\n\n2014\n\nPicks up immediately after The Desolation of Smaug\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\n2001\n\nTakes place 60 years after the events of The Hobbit\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\n2002\n\nPicks up immediately after The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\n2003\n\nPicks up immediately after The Two Towers\n\nThe Lord Of The Rings: The Hunt For Gollum Cast\n\nIs Andy Serkis Returning As Gollum?\n\nClose\n\nBecause not much is known about the planned Lord of the Rings film, the cast of The Hunt for Gollum has not been announced yet. However, the return of Andy Serkis as the director seems to suggest that he will reprise his role as Gollum and presumably his alter-ego Sm\u00e9agol as well. No other characters have been revealed either, and it is difficult to pin down exactly who could reprise their roles from the original Lord of the Rings trilogy. Gandalf and Aragorn seem like logical returns considering the movie's title, but it isn't certain if Sir Ian McKellen or Viggo Mortensen would return.\n\nRelated What \"The Hunt For Gollum\" Actually Means In Lord Of The Rings' New Movie Title\n\nA new Lord of the Rings film has been announced with the title \"The Hunt for Gollum,\" set to be released in 2026. Here's what the title refers to.\n\nThe Lord Of The Rings: The Hunt For Gollum Story\n\nVarious Characters Hunt The One Ring\n\nSince Gollum died at the end of Return of the King, the movie will undoubtedly be a prequel that follows the eponymous character at another point in his life.\n\nEven if Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav didn't reveal any story details when he announced the film, the title of The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum offers a big story tease. Since Gollum died at the end of Return of the King, the movie will undoubtedly be a prequel that follows the eponymous character at another point in his life. When exactly the new Gollum movie takes place in the timeline is unknown, but there is one very likely place.\n\nThough it was glossed over in the film trilogy, Aragorn and Gandalf spend a long time hunting for Gollum in order to make sure he doesn't tip off Sauron about Frodo's mission in The Fellowship of the Ring. The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum could chronicle that sidequest and see the beloved characters return for the first time in years.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is a multimedia franchise consisting of several movies and a TV show released by Amazon titled The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The franchise is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's book series that began in 1954 with The Fellowship of the Ring. The Lord of the Rings saw mainstream popularity with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.\n\nMovie(s) The Lord of the Rings (1978) , The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring , The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers , The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King , The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey , The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug , The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies , The Lord of The Rings: The War of The Rohirrim Created by J.R.R.

A new film, The Hunt for Gollum, has been slated for a 2026 release date with Andy Serkis returning.\n\nDavid Zaslav took to a recent Warner Bros earnings call to announce the bombshell move (via Variety). He revealed that Jackson, who directed the trilogy of Lord of the Rings films, will return as a producer along with his writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. The three will produce the film and \"will be involved every step of the way\" on the new Gollum film.\n\nWhile the film is slated for a 2026 release date, Zaslav revealed that it's in the early stages of script development. He did say that the film will \"explore storylines yet to be told.\"\n\nThe move comes down to box office potential. Zaslav said, \"Lord of the Rings is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for theatrical business.\"\n\nThe Hunt for Gollum\n\nAs for The Hunt for Gollum, Andy Serkis is confirmed to return. He portrayed the role in Jackson's trilogy of films beginning with 2001's Fellowship of the Ring. Serkis also reprised the role in the Hobbit trilogy as well.\n\nHe is also known for his motion-capture work in the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy. Serkis led the first three films as Caesar. He's also had roles in The Adventures of Tintin and Star Wars projects including The Force Awakens, and Andor.\n\nIn The Hunt for Gollum, Serkis will return as the title character. He will also direct the film in a surprising move.\n\nAs a director, Serkis made his directorial debut in 2017 with the film Breathe. He subsequently directed Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle and Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings series\n\nPeter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series are adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's books. Jackson first adapted the trilogy of books -- The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and Return of the King -- before taking on The Hobbit. He adapted The Hobbit across three films with Martin Freeman and Serkis leading the way.\n\nThe original trilogy of films grossed nearly $3 billion worldwide at the box office. Return of the King was the highest-grossing film in the series, grossing over $1.1 billion.\n\nThey were also recognized at the Oscars. All three Lord of the Rings films received several awards, but Return of the King was the big winner. It completely swept and won all of the 11 awards it was up for. That included Best Picture and Best Director for Jackson.\n\nThe Hobbit series was similarly successful. All three films grossed over $900 million worldwide at the box office.\n\nAs Warner Bros' David Zaslav noted, the Lord of the Rings series is a money-maker. It makes sense to bring the franchise back to the big screen. After all, they did recently re-release the Lord of the Rings trilogy in theaters. New stories and films mean a new generation gets to be introduced to the series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_korpan@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Andrew Korpan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Zaslav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Planet of the Apes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Fellowship of the Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Towers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Two Towers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The movie is called The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, and will focus mainly on the character Serkis played in Jackson's original trilogy. The movie is reportedly in the early stages of writing and development, but is expected to premiere in just two years.\n\nWarner Bros. announced The Hunt for Gollum on Thursday during an earnings call, promising an original story backed by the reliable talent fans associate most with the franchise. Jackson and his partners Fran Walsh and Filippa Boyens \"will be involved every step of the way,\" according to Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav. Walsh and Boyens are writing the script along with Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou, with Serkis reprising his role as Gollum and directing the film.\n\nZaslav told investors the movie will \"explore storylines yet to be told,\" but so far fans can only guess on further details. J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth is huge, but his fictional history for the world is arguably even bigger, fleshed out in appendices, short stories and reference books like The Silmarillion. If the movie involves Gollum, we know at least that it takes place when he lived in the Third Age. Gollum lived 589 years from the year TA 2430 to the year TA 3019.\n\nIt's worth noting that there was a fan film titled The Hunt for Gollum released in 2009, which was about an event that was not depicted in Jackson's film trilogy in the early 2000s. Many fans are guessing this new movie will be about the same chapter of the story, but to do so it will have to contradict the other movies in the series - possibly confusing fans in the process.\n\nIn Tolkien's original books, 17 years pass between Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday and Frodo Baggins' departure from the Shire. During this time, Gandalf goes out to research the One Ring, believing it is safe with Frodo. He asks Aragorn to track down Gollum so they can learn what he knows about the Ring, and Aragorn succeeds. However, many fans are not convinced that a dramatization of that hunt would be enough to sustain an entire feature-length film.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings has never gone far from the pop culture zeitgeist since Jackson's movies premiered in 2001, 2002 and 2003, but the franchise saw a particular resurgence in 2022 when Prime Video released its prequel series The Rings of Power, set in Tolkien's Second Age. However, while Amazon has the rights to adapt a small portion of Tolkien's intellectual property, Warner Bros. still has the rights to adapt the main series and the content of The Silmarillion.\n\nIn February of 2023, WB announced plans for \"mutliple\" new Lord of the Rings films, starting with The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim which is slated to premiere on Dec. 13, 2024 in theaters. That animated feature is set about 200 years before the events of The Hobbit. The Hunt for Gollum is the first live-action movie to join this slate since it was announced.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings film trilogy and The Hobbit trilogy are both streaming now on Max. The Rings of Power is streaming on Prime Video. Tolkien's books are available in print, digital and audiobook formats.\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery's CEO David Zaslav, confirmed the return of the films and while he stayed tightlipped about what fans can expect, he said the duo will \"explore storylines yet to be told\".\n\nIn a statement released to the outlet, Jackson, Boyens and Walsh said: \"It is an honour and a privilege to travel back to Middle-earth with our good friend and collaborator, Andy Serkis, who has unfinished business with that stinker -- Gollum!,\" they added: \"As life long fans of Professor Tolkien's vast mythology, we are proud to be working with [WBD film chiefs] Mike De Luca, Pam Abdy and the entire team at Warner Bros. on another epic adventure!\"\n\nMeanwhile, director Serkis said: \"Yesssss, Precious. The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle-earth Peter, Fran and Philippa.\" He added: \"With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our filmmaking family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious... .\"\n\n\"Lord of the Rings is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for our theatrical business,\" Zaslav said.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the new films will be shot exclusively in New Zealand.\n\nThe question on the tip of everyone's tongues is who will return for the new instalment of the films? Casting details are yet to be revealed and likely won't be for a while. However, it appears there is a cast clue in the name of the film.\n\nAt the end at the climax of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Gollum meets his end, meaning the upcoming film may be a prequel. With this in mind, ScreenRant has reported the storyline could take place during the Third Age after the Dark Lord's fall.\n\nIf that is the case, it's likely no cast members from the Kiwi director's original trilogy will return. Thankfully for fans, with new details announced, including the film's name - perhaps the biggest of all - it's likely high sought-after details about the film will be released in the coming months.\n\nIt comes after 79-year-old and former star of the franchise, Bernard Hill, died suddenly on Sunday morning, local time, just hours after it was revealed he had cancelled a scheduled Comic-Con appearance due to his partner being \"very ill\".\n\nLord of the Rings was first released in 2001 with two films proceeding in 2002 and 2003. Earning a slew of awards, the trilogy starred Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin and Cate Blanchett.\n\nIt grossed almost US$3 billion (NZ$4.8b) worldwide and won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 2003.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery investor call this morning, the company has confirmed a 2026 release date for the first of these planned new films.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav made the announcement in a post-earnings call and added that the project is in early stages of script development. In addition he indicates Peter Jackson and his writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, who were behind the original 'Rings' and 'Hobbit' trilogies, will produce and are said to be involved \"every step of the way\".\n\nThe Jackson-directed trilogy released from 2001-03 earned a combined $2.9 billion at the box office.

While the early details are sketchy (at best), during WB's first quarter earnings call on Thursday, CEO David Zaslav teased the director's involvement, stating Jackson and his longtime collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens No news yet on what exactly will be tackled, but Zaslav teased that the new film would\n\nIndeed, Lord of the Rings is a franchise Hollywood seems bent on re-establishing. The issue is that the rights are quite fractured, with Amazon owning the TV rights and mid-way through their own epic TV prequel to the saga, which sports their largest budget to date. Fan reaction to the first season was largely tepid, but the streamer is full-steam ahead on The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Season 2, which is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's appendices.\n\nMeanwhile, WB does have a Lord of the Rings feature coming out this year, in the guise of The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, an animated film with Phillipa Boyens on-board as a producer. It's set for a December 13th, 2024 release.\n\nJackson's involvement in the proposed WB movies is interesting, although it's telling that his involvement isn't specified. Will he direct the films or be on board as a producer? Jackson's relationship with the franchise has been fraught at times, with the Tolkien Estate specifying that he does not have any involvement in the Rings of Power series. Indeed, some of Tolkien's heirs took issue with Jackson's film, which is a bizarre stance given how they brought Tolkien's work to a massive new audience and probably made everyone involved with the estate very rich. The mixed reaction to The Rings of Power likely showed everyone that making new Lord of the Rings isn't so easy and that his involvement shouldn't be taken for granted, as he really is the master of Middle Earth storytelling.\n\nWhat do you think of Peter Jackson's proposed return to the franchise?

Studio giant Warner Bros. Pictures had formally announced its intention to commence work on a new set of Lord of the Ring movies, a little over a year ago. The vision appears to be solidifying. What's more, original director Peter Jackson, is very much on board to give direction to the franchise reboot.\n\nLord of the Rings is getting a reboot\n\nAs per a The Hollywood Reporter report, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures are currently mounting the first film from the refreshed Lord of the Rings franchise. The project has been tentatively titled Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. Andy Serkis, best known for having essayed Gollum across the original franchise, will not only be starring in the reboot, but also be directing it.\n\nDuring Warner Bros. Discovery's first-quarter earnings conference call on Thursday, CEO David Zaslav affirmed that the film is now in the early stages of script development. He also added that Peter Jackson and his longtime writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens \"will be involved every step of the way. \" with the latter two penning the screenplay. The deal discussed by Zaslav comprises of two films in the fresh franchise.\n\nMultiple Lord of the Rings universes appear to be on the way\n\nWhile the world of Gollum is being reconstructed from scratch, a parallel Lord of the Rings universe also appears to be in the works. The aforementioned report shares how Amazon has been developing its own larger TV universe for the franchise. This may just lead to two parallel universes - both belonging to Lord of the Rings - being presented to audiences around the same time.\n\nJackson and his co-writers however, are not involved in the parallel television universe being mounted - a speculation that was rather perplexing to the trio, as per the report.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_entertainment_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic Entertainment Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Serkis will direct and star in the film as the titular corrupted hobbit. According to Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who revealed the movie in an earnings call on Thursday, May 9 (thanks, Variety), the film will \"explore storylines yet to be told.\" Given Gollum's fate in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, this movie will likely be a prequel. The Hunt for Gollum is set to premiere in theaters in 2026.\n\nThis is the first of two upcoming films made in collaboration with Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens, and hopefully it's good, because the character of Gollum could use a win right now. Last year, the former Hobbit starred in his own game from Daedalic Entertainment which Kotaku deemed one of the worst games of 2023. Jackson and Serkis' return and involvement at a leadership level is promising, as Gollum has always been a favorite part of those original movies from the early aughts.\n\nWe don't know a lot about future Lord of the Rings games just now.

Peter Jackson producing the film adds excitement to the project, hinting at a storyline around the One Ring.\n\nWarner Bros. has announced that a new Lord of the Rings movie is on the horizon, revealing the film is centered on Andy Serkis' Gollum -- and that gives fans a good idea of where the project falls on the franchise's timeline.\n\nAccording to Variety, Serkis will reprise his role as Gollum for The Hunt for Gollum, and Peter Jackson will produce the film alongside Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. It's an exciting prospect after years without a Lord of the Rings movie, though 2024's War of the Rohirrim is also on the way. Like The War of the Rohirrim, The Hunt for Gollum's title holds clues as to when it takes place.\n\nThe Hunt For Gollum Is Likely Set Between The Hobbit & Lord Of The Rings\n\nGiven that the new Lord of the Rings movie will focus on the search for Gollum -- and thus the One Ring -- it is likely set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.\n\nSource: Variety", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_mullen@screenrant.com", "name": "Amanda Mullen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lord-of-the-rings-gollum.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553195", "eventUri": "eng-9553195", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The actor created one of the most terrifying, fascinating, and endearing characters in Gollum, a creature tortured by the power of the One Ring. So, while there has been some trepidation over the studio's plans for Lord of the Rings, his involvement is sure to assuage some of those worries, hopefully making way for some excitement.\n\nLord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum is now set for release sometime in 2026.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Discovery's latest earnings briefing, CEO David Zaslav announced that a new Lord of the Rings movie is now in development. It's in the script phase, the executive said. WBD first announced its plans to make more Lord of the Rings movies back in 2023.\n\nIn news that may please fans of the series, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens--the architects of the Oscar-winning original trilogy--are involved in the new movie as producers. Details remain scant on the story, but Zaslav said it will tell a tale focused on Gollum within the Lord of the Rings universe.\n\nA press release revealed that the working title for the film is Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. Andy Serkis, who famously played Gollum in Jackson's trilogy, is coming back to play Gollum again and direct the film, according to Variety. Previously, Serkis said he would jump at the chance to come back and play Gollum again, and now that is coming true.\n\nThe new Lord of the Rings movie will \"explore storylines yet to be told,\" adding that Jackson, Boyens, and Walsh are involved \"every step of the way.\" Zaslav said Lord of the Rings is \"one of the most successful and revered\" franchises in film history, and he believes there continues to be a \"significant opportunity\" for the franchises from a theatrical perspective.\n\nZaslav also mentioned on the call that Lord of the Rings, as well as Harry Potter and DC, are \"underused\" within the company, which suggests it might be planning to leverage them further in the future. The executive has said the company will focus on its tentpole franchises and sequels going forward.\n\nPrior to this, WBD announced a Harry Potter TV series. As for DC, James Gunn and Peter Safran are the new co-heads of DC Studios and have ambitious plans for the future of DC film and TV projects, beginning with a new Superman film in 2025.\n\nLOTR fans don't have to wait until 2026 for a new entry in the film series, though, as an animated LOTR movie, War of the Rohirrim, is coming this December.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings movies from Jackson, Boyens, and Walsh earned billions at the box office and won numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture for Return of the King. Jackson came back to the fantasy universe with a trilogy of Hobbit films. They also made gigantic sums of money at the box office, though these films were not as well received by fans.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eddie_makuch@gamespot.com", "name": "Eddie Makuch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Zaslav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Zaslav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

This time, the spotlight will shine on one of the franchise's most beloved and complex characters: Gollum, played by the incomparable Andy Serkis.\n\nAccording to Variety, the upcoming film, currently titled \"Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum,\" will explore storylines yet to be told about the tragic figure, whose obsession with the One Ring drove him to madness. Serkis, who brought Gollum to life through his groundbreaking motion-capture performance in the original trilogy, will reprise his iconic role, both directing and starring in the new project.\n\nWarner Bros.

From that perspective, it's a little surprising that Warner Bros. Discovery hasn't milked Tolkien's work more than they already have. That'll change soon, though, as the company just announced that there are two new Lord of the Rings films in the works (you can read the full press release here).\n\nThe first is tentatively titled Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, and it's being directed by Andy Serkis -- you may remember him for his landmark performance as Gollum in Jackson's prior movies. The fact that Serkis is on board, and working from a script by Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (who co-wrote the prior Middle-earth movies along with Jackson) has me feeling a bit better about this not being simply a crass cash grab. Peter Jackson, along with Walsh and Boyens, are set to produce as well.\n\nGiven the working title of the film, you won't be surprised to learn that Serkis is also starring again as the titular Gollum. While part of me was interested to see how another actor might take on the character, Serkis so defined Gollum for the big screen that it's almost impossible to put anyone else in the role. As for what the movie will cover, there's no official word yet -- but again, the title indicates it'll take place between the events of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings as Gandalf and Aragorn search Middle-earth for Gollum, trying to learn more about the ring that Bilbo and then Frodo possessed.\n\nGiven Hollywood's insatiable thirst for Content based on Popular Franchises, it's a little surprising something like this didn't happen sooner. Jackson and company followed up the original trilogy of films nine years later with the bloated and overly CGI-reliant film series based on The Hobbit and corresponding events from Tolkien's LOTR appendices. And, of course, Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power series debuted in 2022. And before The Hunt for Gollum arrives, we'll see another intriguing project: an anime-style film called The War of the Rohirrim. That movie arrives this December and covers events in Rohan a few hundred years before The Lord of the Rings.\n\nAs a massive Lord of the Rings fan, I'm both skeptical and excited by this announcement. The sad reality of the entertainment world is that projects like this are going to happen no matter what; there's too much money wrapped up in things like Lord of the Rings to not try and extract more. But Serkis seems like an excellent choice to direct this movie, and hopefully they'll find a tight, self-contained story that works as a standalone film. The mess that was made in the Hobbit films has me wary, but even in those movies I found plenty of things to enjoy -- and this feels like a good opportunity to chart a positive course forward for more movies in Middle-earth.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Fans of Gollum are thrilled by the news of getting a film revolving around him. (Also Read: Bernard Hill, veteran actor best known for Titanic, The Lord of the Rings, dies at 79)\n\nThe media portal reports that the films are \"now in the early stages of script development.\" Andy Serkis is set to star and direct the feature with director Peter Jackson, and his writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens are expected to be 'involved' in every step of the way. Fran and Philippa will write the screenplay, while Peter will produce the project.

The character has become the sneering face of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, and for good reason. Serkis' work as a motion-capture performer carried the medium into a new frontier, and the filmmaker brought pathos to a character who could have easily been an annoying mascot.\n\nFor all his inherent meme potential, Gollum is a compelling, complicated figure. He has the potential to inspire as much sympathy as he does ire, which is why fascination for him has endured decades after his last film appearance.\n\nUnfortunately, that same fascination with Gollum has opened the door for a few unnecessary prequels. 2023 saw ol' Smeagol become the star of his own video game, but to say that The Lord of the Rings: Gollum was a failure would be a gross understatement. But one bad apple isn't enough to dissuade the powers that be, especially as Warner Bros. strives to expand the Lord of the Rings universe on the big screen.\n\nLast year, Warner Bros. teamed with video game company Embracer Group, which recently acquired the rights to develop any Middle-earth-related works authorized by the Tolkien Estate, to develop a new crop of Lord of the Rings films. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav revealed the first product of their partnership, a feature film, is \"in the early stages of script development\" and set for a release in 2026.\n\nPeter Jackson has been chosen to produce the film, with longtime writing partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens \"involved every step of the way.\" The team is even reuniting with Serkis himself, as the filmmaker is set to direct Warner and Embracer's first Lord of the Rings film.\n\nSerkis' involvement confirms that this new batch of films will be set within the continuity of Jackson's trilogies. In addition to director duties, Serkis is reprising his role as Gollum. Though the script is still being written, the film's working title -- The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum -- says a lot with a little.\n\nIt's safe to assume The Hunt for Gollum will take place between the final Hobbit film, The Battle of the Five Armies, and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. There's a 60-year gap between those stories, and Tolkien's written works do briefly describe what Gollum was up to. In the decade before Fellowship, Gollum was captured by Sauron's agents and interrogated in Mordor. Serkis' upcoming film could focus on his ordeal, or any events that precede or follow it. Either way, we could see some of the saga's most popular characters return, from Gandalf and Aragorn to Sauron himself.\n\nSerkis' moves as a director have been fascinating to watch. The Hunt for Gollum will be the filmmaker's latest project after Venom: Let There Be Carnage, his highest-profile stint behind the camera. It's going to be interesting to see how his expertise as a motion-capture artist translates to the story, especially when it comes to a character he spent years building.\n\nThat said, following Gollum around isn't the most exciting prospect for a prequel. Gollum is one of the franchise's biggest characters, but the most compelling aspects of his story have already been told. It's frustrating to see the Lord of the Rings saga so enamored with the past, especially when there's plenty of material for -- and interest in -- the future of Middle-earth. There's no doubt that Serkis' next effort will be visually stunning, but in terms of subject matter, Warner and Embracer's upcoming partnership is already playing things too safe.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_Gollum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings: Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embracer_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embracer Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien_Estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tolkien Estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_title", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Working title"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragorn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aragorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hobbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Fellowship of the Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle Earth Peter, Fran and Philippa,\" said Serkis. \"With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our film making family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\".\n\nSerkis has developed his bona fides as a director of blockbuster films with his helming of \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\" Making the leap to a potential nine-figure budgeted \"Lord of the Rings\" film is a natural step. He had also served as second unit director on Jackson's \"Hobbit\" trilogy.\n\nEarlier in the WBD quarterly earnings call, CEO David Zaslav had said the first of the new \"Lord of the Rings\" films would be released in 2026, though offered no other details at the time.\n\n\"This morning, I'm excited to announce that the team is now in the early stages of script development for the first of the new 'Lord of the Rings' movies, which we anticipate releasing in 2026,\" Zaslav said, \"and we'll explore storylines yet to be told.\"\n\n\"Peter Jackson and his longtime writing partners, Fran Walsh [and] Philippa Boyens are producing and will be involved every step of the way,\" he said.\n\n\"'Lord of the Rings' is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for theatrical business,\" Zaslav added.\n\nFans still have absolutely no idea what material may be adapted for future films beyond \"The Hunt for Gollum.\" First off: Will they be one-offs or connected? But there's certainly plenty of additional material in J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium to mine: There's \"The Silmarillion,\" with its tales of the earliest days of Middle-Earth, centered largely around the immortal elves and their centuries-long war against the evil spirit Morgoth (who was sort of the boss to Sauron, the baddie from the 2001-2003 films we all know and love). And there's the appendices to \"The Lord of the Rings\" itself, which cover a good chunk of 3,000 years of history. Not to mention that Prime Video's \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\" covers a different period of Middle-Earth history altogether, some of it having to be invented from scratch by the writers.\n\nAmazon, under Tolkien superfan Jeff Bezos, bought the rights to the entire Tolkien catalogue. However, Warner Bros. has the exclusive theatrical development and release rights dating back to complicated maneuvering involving Saul Zaentz decades ago.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_blauvelt@indiewire.com", "name": "Christian Blauvelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tolkien's world of Middle Earth -- grossed, making it among the top 20 highest grossing movie franchises of all time. The third entry in the \"Lord of the Rings,\" the 2003 film \"Return of the King\" won 11 Oscars that year, including Best Picture, tying \"Titanic\" and \"Ben-Hur\" for the most in history.\n\nZaslav has emphasized the importance of \"Lord of the Rings\" as a central part of Warner Bros. Discovery's future strategy, claiming it, along with the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and DC Comics, are some of the struggling legacy media company's biggest IP assets but are currently \"underused.\" The last movie set in Middle Earth was the final entry in the Hobbit trilogy, \"the Battle of the Five Armies,\" which came out in 2014. Warner is also rebooting the \"Harry Potter\" franchise with a new TV series on its Max streaming service that's also eyeing a 2026 release, following up on the decade-long run of movies based on J.K. Rowling's book series that was released from 2001 to 2011. Additionally, the company has tapped director James Gunn to reboot its movies based around the DC Comics superheroes, with a new Superman movie set to be released next year.\n\nWarner Bros. and New Line Cinema are releasing a new animated \"Lord of the Rings\" movie called \"The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,\" which will be released this Christmas. Any new \"Lord of the Rings\" will also have to contend with Amazon Prime's \"The Rings of Power,\" a TV series set thousands of years before the events of \"Lord of the Rings,\" which has cost Amazon nearly $1 billion and is considered to be the most expensive show of all time. Season two is set to premiere later this year after season one earned generally positive reviews from critics but became the target of online controversy over its diverse cast.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery announced Thursday while it saw growth in its streaming subscribers, revenues missed expectations and dropped 7% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023.

Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings Books In Order: Chronological & Release Date", "body": "What The Nazgul's Hidden Song In The Lord Of The Rings Really Means Summary Begin with Tolkien's creation story in 'The Silmarillion' for a deep dive into the birth of Middle-earth's universe and lore. Follow the timeline from the First Age to the end of the Third Age with various novels in Tolkien's meticulously crafted Middle-earth chronology. Whether you choose to read in release order or chronological order, savor the magic of Tolkien's rich and intricate world-building at your own pace. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien wrote several stories set in Middle-earth along with The Lord of the Rings, each taking place at different points in this fictional universe's timeline. Of course, with many of these books being prequels to Frodo's story, it can sometimes be confusing to pinpoint a reading order. Those looking to get into Tolkien's Middle-earth works can choose between the chronological and release date orders, and both come with pros and cons.\n\nTolkien's first book set in Middle-earth was The Hobbit, and he expanded his world from there. His The Lord of the Rings books became the figurehead for the overall franchise, and, thanks to Peter Jackson's film trilogy, is what often comes to mind when thinking of Tolkien. However, the author constructed a deep and complex lore for Middle-earth and wrote dozens of stories that spanned thousands of years across his meticulous timeline. Though these were released years after Tolkien's death, many were set centuries before Frodo's story.\n\nRelated Every Upcoming Lord Of The Rings Movie & TV Show\n\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise has seen a resurgence in film and TV of late; here is every project coming out of Middle-earth in the near future.\n\nHow To Read J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings Books In Chronological Order Tolkien's Middle-Earth Stories In Order From Creation To The End Of The Third Age Close\n\nThose looking to read all the Lord of the Rings books in chronological order will have to begin with the universe's creation. Tolkien's The Silmarillion outlines the birth of time and space, with everything brought into being by a supreme god called Eru Il\u00favatar. From here, the posthumously published book describes the creation of the Ainur -- the Valar and Maiar -- who assisted Eru in creating Arda (the World). The Silmarillion carries on into the years before Elves and Men wake in Middle-earth, their eventual rise, and the destruction caused by the Dark Lord Morgoth.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth Books In Chronological Order\n\nBook Title\n\nTime Period\n\nThe Silmarillion\n\nCreation of the Universe - End of the First Age\n\nUnfinished Tales Of Numenor & Middle-Earth\n\nCreation of the Universe - End of the Third Age\n\nBeren & L\u00fathien\n\nFirst Age 464 - First Age 503\n\nThe Children Of H\u00farin\n\nFirst Age 473 - First Age 501\n\nThe Fall Of Gondolin\n\nFirst Age 510\n\nThe Fall Of N\u00famenor\n\nSecond Age 3319\n\nThe Hobbit\n\nThird Age 2941\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThird Age 3018\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nThird Age 3019\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nThird Age 3019 - Third Age 3021\n\nMorgoth's defeat marks the end of The Silmarillion and the end of the First Age of Middle-earth. Many of the next books in the chronology tell stories that are also included in the Silmarillion, though there are some differences in how certain events play out. Unfinished Tales Of Numenor & Middle-Earth also outlines the creation of the universe, but rather than ending with the First Age, it continues all the way to the destruction of the One Ring. Though this takes us to the end of the chronology, its First Age stories place it earlier in the lineup.\n\nFrom here, three individual novels (all posthumously published) go more in-depth into First Age stories discussed in The Silmarillion. Beren and L\u00fathien is Tolkien's most famous love story set in the First Age (464 - 503). The Children Of H\u00farin follows the tragic story of H\u00farin's cursed descendants and is set around the same time as Beren and L\u00fathien. The Fall of Gondolin tells the story of the Secret City, which was destroyed by Morgoth's forces after its location was betrayed. In canon, Gondolin was destroyed in SA 510, so the book is set shortly after the previous two novels.\n\nThe Fall Of N\u00famenor is the only Tolkien novel set in the Second Age of Middle-earth. It tells of the downfall of the island kingdom of N\u00famenor, an event depicted in Prime Video's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. Finally, the last four books in Tolkien's chronology are The Hobbit and the three Lord of the Rings, set at the end of Middle-earth's Third Age.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings were initially published as six books but were later republished as three.\n\nHow To Read J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings Books In Release Order Tolkien's Middle-Earth Books Weren't Released In Chronological Order\n\nTolkien's Middle-Earth Books By Order Of Release\n\nBook Title\n\nRelease Year\n\nThe Hobbit\n\n1937\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\n1954\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\n1954\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\n1955\n\nThe Silmarillion\n\n1977\n\nUnfinished Tales of Numenor & Middle-Earth\n\n1980\n\nThe Children of H\u00farin\n\n2007\n\nBeren and L\u00fathien\n\n2017\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin\n\n2018\n\nThe Fall of N\u00famenor\n\n2022\n\nThe release dates of Tolkien's works differ significantly from the chronology. The author originally published The Hobbit as a stand-alone novel in 1937, and it wasn't until many years later that he decided to expand the story with the Lord of the Rings books. These were the only Middle-earth novels to be published before Tolkien died in 1973, but he had written innumerable notes and stories about his fictional world, which were collected and published by his son, Christopher Tolkien, in the following years.\n\nUltimately, there's no wrong way to enjoy Tolkien's life's work, so long as the magic is thoroughly savored and enjoyed.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is a rare case in which the release-year order may be preferred to the chronological one. The Silmarillion is written more like a textbook than a novel, and it is far easier to read with the context of The Lord of the Rings to build upon. However, since the stories of Beren and L\u00fathien and The Fall of Gondolin are mentioned in the Lord of the Rings books, there may be some value in reading these stories first. Ultimately, there's no wrong way to enjoy Tolkien's life's work, so long as the magic is thoroughly savored and enjoyed.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is a multimedia franchise consisting of several movies and a TV show released by Amazon titled The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The franchise is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's book series that began in 1954 with The Fellowship of the Ring.

It still holds up. All of Peter Jackson's famed trilogy holds up well. Based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, the films gave a definitive version of that world which was loved by fans old and new (unless you're a Tom Bombadil stan). Jackson returned to Middle Earth years later to adapt the Hobbit into a new trilogy, but it wasn't the same.\n\nNow, Jackson is popping on his hairy feet and venturing to Mordor again. Variety reports that everyone's least favorite CEO (which is really saying something), David Zaslav, confirmed a new set of Lord Of the Rings films is being developed at Warner Brothers Discovery. The script for the first film is in early development, with a targeted release in 2026. It aims to \"explore storylines yet to be told,\" so chin up, Bombadil heads.\n\nZaslav said Jackson \"will be involved every step of the way.\" \"Lord of the Rings is one of the most successful and revered franchises in history and presents a significant opportunity for theatrical business,\" said Zaslav, likely between laps in a pile of gold doubloons. The Lord Of The Rings trilogy has made Warner Brothers a lot of money, so it makes sense that the CEO's eyes turned into dollar signs while he made the announcement (allegedly).\n\nBetween this and a new series based on the Harry Potter books, Zaslav's reign as head of WBD continues to be void of creativity or originality. There are no new ideas. He looks at what has worked in the past and says \"Let's do that again, so I can keep paying myself 50 million dollars a year for doing nothing,\" I assume. I'm not even totally against making new Lord Of The Rings films. Running it back with Jackson again feels hollow, and Zaslav's presence brings an undeniable stink.\n\nI enjoyed Amazon's The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power (not everyone did). That show is planned to last for five seasons. With this announcement, there's a chance we will see Middle Earth on TV and the big screen in 2026. I'd be lying if I said that didn't make the property feel less special. I don't need Lord Of The Rings to go the way of Star Wars or the MCU, but as long as people like Jeff Bezos and David Zaslav control these decisions, that's likely going to happen.

He's also developing an animated fantasy drama titled Animal Farm.\n\nBack in March 2023, BroBible's Post Credit Podcast was the first to ask Serkis about his feelings on new Lord of the Rings movies after they were announced, so we've republished the interview below.\n\nOriginal article:\n\nBack in late February, news broke that Warner Bros. and New Line reached an agreement to develop new films in the Lord of the Rings franchise and are hoping to get original franchise director Peter Jackson back in the fold.\n\nBeginning in 2001 with Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the original Lord of the Rings trilogy spawned three Oscar-nominated films, with the third actually winning Best Picture. Then, about a decade later, Warner Bros. began rolling out (admittedly not as well-received) prequel films with The Hobbit franchise.\n\nAt this time, \"Middle-Earth\" is currently the 12th highest-grossing film franchise of all time with almost $6 billion at the global box office.\n\nIn addition to Jackson in the director's chair, those six films all have one thing in common, and that's the presence of famed motion-capture actor Andy Serkis, who stars in the franchise as Gollum, a One Ring-corrupted monster who spends his life in pursuit of the artifact.\n\nDuring a recent interview with BroBible's Post-Credit Podcast, we asked Serkis -- promoting the release of his new film, Netflix's Luther: The Fallen Sun -- about the development of new Lord of the Rings films and the actor indicated that he would happily return to the franchise should they come calling.\n\n\"Look, [producers] Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens are sort of a second family that I have become part of and have gone on to make so many films with,\" Serkis told BroBible's Post-Credit Podcast.\n\n\"And -- let me tell you -- they are the best and most incredible people to work with. I think that there are so many other potential Middle-Earth projects which could come about, and if they're doing them, I would, of course, jump at the chance to have that relationship rekindled ... Middle-Earth has never left me.\"\n\nSerkis will next be seen starring alongside Idris Elba and Cynthia Erivo in Luther: The Fallen Sun, which hits Netflix on Friday, March 10. He's also set to begin production of The Batman: Part Two later this year, as reports indicate filming will start in November.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_italiano@brobible.com", "name": "Eric Italiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animal Farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Fellowship of the Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Line Cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Batman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Erivo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cynthia Erivo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Boyens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippa Boyens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Walsh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fran Walsh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_Elba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idris Elba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/andy-serkis-lord-of-the-rings-gollum-collage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553195", "eventUri": "eng-9553195", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-10", "textStart": 2684, "textEnd": 2692}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It's been more than two decades since \"The Return of the King\" hit theaters, and all the movies are still as great as ever.\n\nWell, Warner Bros. is interested in attempting to cash in even more with a new film to be released in a couple of years.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced Thursday on an earnings call that a new movie will be released in 2026, and the focus will be on the legendary villain/sympathetic character Gollum, according to Variety. The film will be titled \"Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum,\" Andy Serkis will return to play the character and direct.\n\nThe project is in the stage of having a script written and Peter Jackson and his partners Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens \"will be involved every step of the way\" as producers.\n\nThe band is getting back together, and that's great news for fans.\n\nNow, this isn't the first \"LOTR\" content since the original trilogy ended. There were three \"Hobbit\" films and there's an ongoing Amazon series.\n\nThe \"Hobbit\" movies were disappointing and the Amazon series is nothing short of unwatchable woke trash. It's terrible. How Amazon allowed that horrible series to ever be made is beyond me, but I digress.\n\nWhat I will say is that if \"Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum\" is anything like the original three movies, then it's going to be a must-watch.\n\n\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\" \"The Two Towers\" and \"The Return of the King\" are all amazing. The trilogy won a combined 17 Academy Awards and scored 30 nominations. We've never seen a trilogy as elite ever since, and it might be a long time until we do.\n\nNow, Warner Bros. is going back to the well to bring fans even more \"LOTR\" content. I just pray it's not as bad as the Amazon series. I won't be able to stomach it if that's the case.

The incoming film was announced in mid-2024, with several thrilling collaborators all but guaranteed to make the release a sweeping success.\n\nAndy Serkis, the longtime voice and motion capture artist behind the tragic Stoor Hobbit, is set to return as both star and director of the film. He'll be joined by seasoned Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson as they combine their talents to create a fresh look at one of Middle Earth's most tortured souls.\n\nDetails about The Hunt for Gollum are still scarce, but we do have a broad release window for the feature. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav anticipates a release date nestled somewhere in 2026, leaving fans with only a few years to wait for another adventure across the fantasy world that inspired a generation (or three) of readers, viewers, and gamers.\n\nEasily the most exciting returning face is Andy Serkis, who brought Gollum to brilliant life across four Lord of the Rings releases through the 2000s and 2010s. He'll be joined by Jackson, a seasoned director with a passion for J.R.R. Tolkien's works, along with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, Jackson's longtime writing partners, who are stepping into write the screenplay.\n\nNo other on-screen talent has been released, but fans are praying for at least one or two returning faces. Depending on which time period in Gollum's life the film follows, there's the potential to see a few fan-favorite stars return, but the release is likely to largely introduce a new cast for audiences to enjoy.\n\nWe still don't know much about the plot behind The Hunt for Gollum, but we do know the project aims to \"explore storylines yet to be told.\" That means we won't be seeing any rehashing of old storylines, with the crew behind the release instead focused on examining other aspects of Tolkien's sprawling world.\n\nThe Hunt for Gollum isn't the only project eyeing a return to Middle Earth. Its one among several incoming releases in \"the early stages of script development,\" which means that we'll be seeing plenty more of the iconic fantasy world soon.

But Please, Stop With the Spinoffs", "body": "The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the Earth. I smell it in the air. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, my favorite film property, is slowly morphing into yet another curs\u00e8d cinematic universe that will haunt me with new installments of diminishing quality until the day I die. I mean, seriously, who in Galadriel's name actually wants a whole new set of movies built around Gollum?!\n\nThe tragic news hit Middle Earth on Thursday: According to Variety, Warner Bros. -- which is apparently intent on milking this beloved franchise until it is drier than Frodo's skin at the end of Return of the King -- is now working on a new batch of films built around Andy Serkis's shifty-eyed character. The first is set to premiere in 2026. In the words of Smeagol himself, \"AAAAGH! ... You ruins it!\"\n\nThe working title for the first of these films is Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, which is actually pretty funny because a 2009 fan film already adapted this book lore with the exact same title. (Gollum was also the subject of a terrible video game last year, so it seems we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.) Serkis will both direct and star, according to Variety, and he'll also executive produce alongside Ken Kamins and The Imaginarium's Jonathan Cavendish.\n\nNo offense to any of these guys, but I simply cannot fathom who is craving more LOTR content after six movies and a seriously expensive flop of a TV series. (Remember how Amazon reportedly spent $ 715 million on its 2022 Lord of the Rings series The Rings of Power, only for it to fall flat on its elven face? Why are we still doing this?!)\n\nIn a Thursday earnings call, Warner Bros. Discovery and industry Sauron David Zaslav reportedly assured everyone that Peter Jackson and his fellow original trilogy masterminds Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens \"will be involved every step of the way\" for these new films. Then again, Jackson also directed the Hobbit prequels of the 2010s, and frankly, the only aspect of those films that I continue to value is Lee Pace's excellently committed performance as Thranduil the Elvenking. Sorry, not sorry!\n\nAs absurd as this news feels, we've known it was coming for a while; Warner Bros. first announced its intention to create more films inspired by J.R.R. Tolkein's work last February. In this IP-driven era of Hollywood, pretty much every major franchise gets the cinematic universe treatment, from Star Wars to Harry Potter (the latter of which has its own series adaptation on the way from Warners as we speak). All of this to say, this is par for the course.\n\nStill, as someone who used to love Star Wars and can now barely muster the energy to watch the newest entries in a seemingly endless stream of Lucasfilm series, and who still watches the original Lord of the Rings trilogy every Thanksgiving, the news of these new Gollum movies (Gollum movies!?!) has me feeling more exhausted than ever.

Motion Picture Group's executives Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy have announced an exciting development in the world of Middle-earth. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens, the Oscar-winning trio behind the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, are set to produce two new films for Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. The first film, which has the working title Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, will arrive in theaters in 2026.\n\nAndy Serkis, known for his groundbreaking portrayal of Gollum as well as his directorial work in films like 2021's Venom: Let There Be Carnage and 2018's Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, will direct and star in the upcoming The Hunt for Gollum. The screenplay will be penned by Walsh and Boyens, alongside Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou, who previously worked on Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim. Ken Kamins will serve as the executive producer, with Serkis's The Imaginarium's Jonathan Cavendish also producing.\n\nDe Luca and Abdy expressed their enthusiasm for the project, noting the lasting impact of the original film trilogy and the dedication shown by Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens to preserving Tolkien's legacy. They stated, \"For over two-decades, moviegoers have embraced the Lord of the Rings film trilogy because of the undeniable devotion Peter, Fran, and Philippa have shown towards protecting the legacy of Tolkien's works, and to ensure audiences could experience the incredible world he created in a way that honors his literary vision. We are honored they have agreed to be our partners on these two new films. With Andy coming aboard to direct Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum (*WT), we continue an important commitment to excellence that is a true hallmark of how we all want to venture ahead and further contribute to the Lord of the Rings cinematic history.\"\n\nJackson, Walsh, and Boyens shared their excitement about revisiting Middle-earth and collaborating once again with Serkis, highlighting their personal connection to the story and its characters. \"It is an honour and a privilege to travel back to Middle-earth with our good friend and collaborator, Andy Serkis, who has unfinished business with that Stinker - Gollum! As lifelong fans of Professor Tolkien's vast mythology, we are proud to be working with Mike De Luca, Pam Abdy, and the entire team at Warner Bros. on another epic adventure!\"\n\nSerkis also commented on his return to Middle-earth, reflecting his enthusiasm for the project and his collaborators. He said, \"Yesssss, Precious. The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle Earth Peter, Fran, and Philippa.

Martin's LOTR Criticism Misses The Point Of Gandalf's Death", "body": "LOTR Art Turns The Fellowship Into A Rock Band (& Gimli Loves Being The Drummer) Summary Martin criticizes Gandalf's return in The Lord of the Rings , arguing that his death's impact should have been permanent for a more powerful narrative. Despite Martin's preferences, Gandalf's resurrection in LOTR serves a crucial role and sends a strong message. Gandalf's role in Tolkien's universe as an angelic being means he shouldn't be subject to the same rules as Game of Thrones' human characters. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nGame of Thrones author George R.R. Martin is clearly a huge fantasy fan, but one of his Lord of the Rings criticisms misses the point of Gandalf's death. Martin has a reputation for killing off characters, as A Song of Ice and Fire isn't shy about eliminating even major players like Ned Stark. Martin has strong feelings about character deaths, as the Game of Thrones writer believes death scenes should leave strong impressions. Many other authors are less willing to ax characters, and in some cases, that caution can backfire.\n\nAlthough Martin clearly draws inspiration from The Lord of the Rings and other classic fantasy narratives, the author has issues with J.R.R. Tolkien's approach to Gandalf's character arc. Gandalf famously perishes in The Fellowship of the Ring, but he returns as Gandalf the White in The Two Towers. His death and rebirth is a major part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it has a deeper meaning for the wizard. Unfortunately, Martin still isn't a huge fan of the way Gandalf's death was handled.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin's Problem With Gandalf's Death In Lord Of The Rings Explained The Game Of Thrones Author Believes He Should Have Stayed Dead\n\nMartin isn't afraid to kill off characters in his own books, and the author believes that other writers would benefit from a more permanent approach to fictional deaths. During a Bullseye With Jesse Thorn interview, Martin discussed death being a \"transformative experience\" in fiction. He emphasized that death should have a lasting impact on a character, even if they come back from it -- though it seems he'd prefer that happened less often, too. Martin expressed his disappointment that Tolkien brought Gandalf back after his fight with the Balrog, admitting that he \"always felt like Gandalf should have stayed dead.\"\n\nFor one, Martin feels that Gandalf the Grey's final moments in The Fellowship of the Ring were the perfect send-off for the character -- and he's got a point there. \"What power that had, how that grabbed me,\" he said. Unfortunately, the sacrifice feels somewhat less powerful when Gandalf returns as the White Wizard. And Gandalf's comeback doesn't follow Martin's preferred rule of bringing back a character. The Lord of the Rings doesn't take anything from Gandalf in exchange for reviving him. As Martin put it, \"if anything, he's sort of improved.\"\n\nMartin feels that The Lord of the Rings would have benefited from keeping Gandalf dead. And while his criticisms make sense within his own rules for writing and reviving characters, they miss key aspects of Gandalf's revival. It's difficult to compare the wizard's return to Jon Snow's or Lady Stoneheart's. After all, Gandalf serves a very different function within Tolkien's narrative.\n\nGRRM Is Missing The Point Of Gandalf's Death In Lord Of The Rings Gandalf's Role In Tolkien's Series Is Different From George R.R. Martin's Resurrected Characters'\n\nAlthough Martin's approach to killing characters makes sense, his sentiments about Gandalf's death miss the point of the character in The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf's role in the story is different from that of Jon Snow or Catelyn Stark in Game of Thrones. For one, he isn't a human character, so he shouldn't be held to human standards, even in death. Martin's philosophy about losing a part of oneself makes sense for human characters, but Gandalf being an angelic being in Tolkien's universe makes it a moot point. His character is perfectly set up for extraordinary feats like returning from the dead.\n\nMartin's philosophy about losing a part of oneself makes sense for human characters, but Gandalf being an angelic being in Tolkien's universe makes it a moot point.\n\nAdditionally, Gandalf's sacrifice making him stronger sends a powerful message within The Lord of the Rings' narrative. The Grey Wizard gives his life to save his friends and ensure Sauron's defeat -- two things that should be rewarded. By bringing Gandalf back stronger, Tolkien emphasizes that embracing friendship and hope makes a person more powerful. This wouldn't apply to characters like Jon, Catelyn, or Beric Dondarrion, all of whom perish after being betrayed or murdered. It makes sense that they'd return as completely different people; their last moments changed them negatively.\n\nFinally, Gandalf is meant to be a guiding force throughout The Lord of the Rings. This is a much different role than being a major political player in Game of Thrones. He's a necessary addition to The Two Towers and The Return of the King, and it's unclear if The Lord of the Rings' outcome would be different without his return.\n\nLord Of The Rings Keeping Gandalf Dead Wouldn't Have Worked Close\n\nGandalf's resurrection in The Lord of the Rings works regardless of Martin's philosophy, and it's unlikely that keeping the character dead would have benefited Tolkien's series without some massive changes. Gandalf is a huge reason that Middle-earth defeats Sauron, and it's difficult to envision Tolkien's story without him returning as the White Wizard. He directly impacts the Battle of Helm's Deep, which would have been lost without his interference. This defeat would also have prevented Aragorn and the others from distracting Sauron long enough for Frodo and Sam to get into Mordor.\n\nNeedless to say, Gandalf's return is a necessary element of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. And it makes sense within Tolkien's lore. While Martin's approach to character deaths is a smart one, it doesn't account for the many ways Gandalf differs from other fantasy characters. The Lord of the Rings makes sense of his revival, and it sends an important message by having him become Gandalf the White.\n\nSource: Bullseye With Jesse Thorn\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is a multimedia franchise consisting of several movies and a TV show released by Amazon titled The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.

Not...more Gollum.\n\nNaturally, Gollum actor Andy Serkis is returning for the role, but not only that, he's also directing the film. Serkis previously directed the Venom sequel, Let There Be Carnage, and 2018's Mowgli movie. This would be the first LOTR film not directed by Peter Jackson, who is instead producing. Here's Serkis had to say about the Gollum film:\n\n\"Yesssss, Precious,\" Serkis said. \"The time has come once more to venture into the unknown with my dear friends, the extraordinary and incomparable guardians of Middle-earth Peter, Fran and Philippa. With Mike and Pam, and the Warner Bros team on the quest as well, alongside WETA and our film making family in New Zealand, it's just all too delicious...\"\n\nGollum appeared both in the original trilogy and Peter Jackson's follow-up Hobbit trilogy to a lesser extent. So this would be the third slate of projects that he's now in, and a second LOTR film is supposed to be in the works, separate from this one.\n\nLord of the Rings has been a bit all over the place in recent years. Amazon, with the TV rights, has invested $1 billion into Rings of Power, its massive LOTR show focused on a young Galadriel and Elrond, which aired its first season to somewhat mixed reviews from both critics and fans. At least four more seasons are planned.\n\nMeanwhile, in the gaming space, one of the worst video games in recent memory was in fact...The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, a horrific offering from Daedalic Entertainment that was decried as the worst game of 2023 with a shocking 33 on Metacritic. So that's the last we saw of Gollum (he was not voiced by Serkis there).\n\nIt is no surprise that Warner Bros. wants to make more Lord of the Rings films. The original trilogy of movies were all-time fantasy classics beloved by fans and with huge box office returns. The Hobbit films were less beloved, certainly, but still performed great globally, each raking in $950-$1 billion by the end of their run. That's absolutely something WB wants to see again.\n\nAgain, I am skeptical of a new film focused on Gollum as its star, but Serkis has always been excellent in the role, and I'm curious what he will do as a director, even if he's somewhat still unproven in that realm.

Discovery announced that the company would be producing new Lord of the Rings movies, but said very little about what they would be about -- riddles in the dark, if you will. It's been a long 15 months since then, but the latest Middle-earth adventure has finally been revealed: Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, directed by and starring Andy Serkis.\n\n\"A Gollum movie?\" you might say. \"How derivative! Wasn't there just a video game about this?\"\n\nIndeed there was, constant reader. However, the film might differ in the very crucial manner of being a pleasurable experience.\n\nAccording to Variety, the film is still early in development, with a script being worked on by Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou alongside Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens -- who, along with Peter Jackson, have signed on as co-producers that WBD CEO David Zaslav says will be involved \"every step of the way.\"\n\nEven though the story is actively being worked on -- the title also isn't final -- we can safely surmise that it is a prequel, as Gollum, famously, is super dead by the end of The Return of the King. Book readers might take this premise to suggest the story is set in the nebulous and quite long period between Bilbo's Party at the start of The Fellowship of the Ring, and the beginning of the quest to destroy the Ring, when Gandalf sent Aragorn to find Gollum.\n\nThat said, there is probably a reason why both book and films never really bothered to recount this particular side quest in detail: It doesn't seem to be about anything in particular.

Jackson, along with his wife and co-writer Fran Walsh, will produce and write the script.\n\nJackson's trilogy made nearly three billion dollars between 2001 and 2003. The final chapter, 2003's The Return of the King, won Best Picture and Best Director Oscars.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, Jackson returned to Tolkien's Middle Earth with three Hobbit movies. This trilogy also made around three billion dollars. But no one liked it very much. After producing ten hours of Rings movies, Jackson had obviously run out of things to say. The Hobbit movies were CGI spectacles and not much else.\n\nThen came Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power in 2022, an eight-episode streaming series that went woke and was hit with fan ridicule and a hearty backlash. Apparently, Amazon has committed to four more seasons.\n\nAnd now, here we go again with even more Rings.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is also returning to the Harry Potter franchises. After eight films between 2001 and 2011, those very same books are set to be adapted into a seven-season streaming series for Max. Yes, it's the same stories from the same books. But instead of 2.5 hours devoted to each book, fans will enjoy ten hours.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery's other big franchise is more superhero crap, starting with another Superman movie next year.\n\nWe were making fun of the whole idea of sequels in the 1980s. Who would have thought it could get this much worse? And Hollywood is still making sequels out of 80s movies: Rocky, Ghostbusters, Beverly Hills Cop, Karate Kid, Rambo, Alien, Child's Play, Predator, Halloween, Terminator, Indiana Jones, Fletch, Batman, Star Trek, Evil Dead, etc.\n\nThe Disney Grooming Syndicate has basically boiled itself down to Marvel and Toy Story/Frozen/Princess/Star Wars.\n\nThis weekend, we get a new Planet of the Apes movie -- the TENTH chapter in a 56-year-old franchise.\n\nHonestly, at this rate, in 20 years, all the studios will have meshed into a single studio, and that one studio will simply tell the same story over and over again.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum will feature director Andy Serkis returning as Gollum, which could mean other characters will return. Mortensen's age may complicate Aragorn's appearance, but he would have to play the role in order to maintain character continuity. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nIf Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum features Viggo Mortensen reprising his original role as Aragorn, he will be older than Ian McKellen when he originally played Gandalf. Although he had been working since the mid-1980s, Mortensen had his breakout role when he brought the iconic character Aragorn to life in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, which premiered between 2001 and 2003. Since then, he has appeared in a variety of major projects including three titles that earned him Oscar nominations, namely 2007's Eastern Promises, 2016's Captain Fantastic, and 2018's Green Book.\n\nThe upcoming Lord of the Rings movieThe Hunt for Gollum is set to be a new live-action installment in the iconic fantasy franchise featuring returning star Andy Serkis appearing as Gollum in addition to directing the movie. So far, no details have been revealed about the plot of the movie beyond the implications of the title. However, because Gollum's presence indicates that the movie takes place during a specific epoch in the timeline of Middle-earth, this means that other actors, including Mortensen, could potentially reprise their original roles.\n\nRelated When Lord Of The Rings' New Gollum Movie Takes Place In The Timeline\n\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise is getting a new Gollum movie, but where does The Hunt for Gollum fall on the timeline? Its title holds a clue.\n\nHow Old Viggo Mortensen Will Be When 2026's Lord Of The Rings Movie Comes Out Viggo Mortensen Was Born On October 20, 1958\n\nIf the movie's release stays true to the current plan, Viggo Mortensen will be either 67 or 68 when The Hunt for Gollum premieres. In comparison, when the original Lord of the Rings movies premiered, he was 43, 44, and 45. All three movies were shot concurrently between 1999 and 2000, making him 40 when production kicked off and 42 when it ended. Overall, this makes 43 his oldest onscreen age as Aragorn, as he has not reprised his role since the release of The Return of the King in 2003.\n\nProduction on The Lord of the Rings kicked off on October 11, just days before Mortensen's 41st birthday.\n\nEven if production on The Hunt for Gollum began right away, should Mortensen appear, he would be older than Ian McKellen was when he played the ancient wizard Gandalf in the original trilogy. McKellen, who was born on May 25, 1939, was 60 when production began and 61 when it ended, and Mortensen is already 65 at the time of writing. While this is still younger than McKellen's age when principal photography began on the Hobbit prequel trilogy in 2011, this makes Mortensen older than McKellen was when he shot Gandalf's latest moments in the Lord of the Rings timeline.\n\nAn Older Aragorn Wouldn't Work For 2026's Lord Of The Rings Movie The Lord Of The Rings Timeline Limits When The Hunt For Gollum Will Take Place\n\nShould Aragorn appear in Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, Mortensen's age wouldn't work for the character. Although the timeline of the new movie has not been officially announced, there are only a limited amount of periods in Middle-earth history in which the movie can take place. Because Gollum dies during the events of The Return of the King, it seems most likely that the movie will be a prequel set between the events of The Hobbit and the original trilogy, making Aragorn even younger than he was in the original movie, 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nMortensen's real-life age would complicate the character's appearance onscreen...\n\nHis increased age wasn't an issue for McKellen when he reprised the role of Gandalf in the Hobbit prequel movies, as he had already been made up to look older than 60 in the original trilogy. However, Aragorn's age makes Mortensen's appearance in the role particularly complicated. The character, who has D\u00fanedain heritage and thus a slightly extended life span, was already 87 years old during the timeline of the original trilogy. Because of Aragorn's delayed aging process, Mortensen's real-life age would complicate the character's appearance onscreen.\n\nThe Hunt For Gollum Can't Recast Aragorn - Even If Mortensen's Age Creates A Plot Hole Nobody But Viggo Mortensen Can Play Aragorn Close\n\nEven though his age would pose an issue for Aragorn's appearance in the movie, Viggo Mortensen would have to be the one to play the role in The Hunt for Gollum no matter what. The fact that Serkis is reprising the role of Gollum means that the movie is inextricably linked to the timeline of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies. Because of this, any legacy characters returning to the franchise should naturally be played by the original actors wherever possible, especially considering how iconic Mortensen's turn in the role proved to be.\n\nSerkis previously appeared onscreen as Gollum in 2002's The Two Towers , 2003's The Return of the King , and 2012's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey .\n\nMortensen would also have to be the one to play Aragorn because of the character's aging process. Although the franchise has cast younger versions of the characters Bilbo Baggins, Galadriel, and Elrond in The Hobbit and the Prime Video series The Rings of Power, those prequels took place a significant number of years before the original trilogy, justifying the recasting even for the immortal characters. However, the timeline required by Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum would imply that any younger actor had rapidly aged to look like Mortensen in an impossibly brief time.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings\n\nThe Lord of the Rings is a multimedia franchise consisting of several movies and a TV show released by Amazon titled The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The franchise is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's book series that began in 1954 with The Fellowship of the Ring. The Lord of the Rings saw mainstream popularity with Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.\n\nMovie(s) The Lord of the Rings (1978) , The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of

The trailer in question is a deepfake -- and a darn good one too. It depicts an alleged \"reboot\" of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy featuring Tom Holland as Frodo Baggins. Joining him in his quest is his faithful servant Samwise, recast as Jacob Batalon (who also plays Ned, Peter Parker's newly minted sorcerer best friend in the MCU).\n\nThe nearly two-minute trailer utilizes several clips from both of Peter Jackson's Middle-earth trilogies. We see pre-existing shots of places like Bag End, Lake-town, and the Lonely Mountain. A lofty mountain peak scene from Amazon Prime's \"The Rings of Power\" series is also included. Scattered amid this repurposed footage are several deepfake scenes with both actors' faces layered over the bodies and movements of Elijah Wood's Frodo and Sean Astin's Samwise. Their voices are even adjusted to sound like the faux actor replacements for dramatic effect. The clickbaity title for the trailer reads \"The Lord of the Rings (2025) - First Trailer | Tom Holland, Jacob Batalon.\"\n\nThe jolly little clip was put together by KH Studios, a YouTube channel committed to \"creating concept trailers and much more just for fun and to bring entertainment to all of you.\" The channel's home page adds that its trailer mashups are derivations of existing or potential projects from real studios and that its content helps to amp up anticipation for future releases -- both of the legitimate and hopeful variety.", "source": {"uri": "looper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Looper.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Holland_(author)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Holland (author)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Batalon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Batalon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samwise Gamgee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frodo_Baggins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frodo Baggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_End", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bag End"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lonely Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esgaroth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esgaroth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Astin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Astin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elijah Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.looper.com/img/gallery/new-lord-of-the-rings-trailer-casts-tom-holland-as-frodo-in-a-hilarious-deepfake/l-intro-1715125627.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553195", "eventUri": "eng-9553195", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

But I Beg you, Stop With the Spinoffs", "body": "The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the Earth. I smell it in the air. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, my favorite film property, is slowly morphing into yet another curs\u00e8d cinematic universe that will haunt me with new installments of diminishing quality until the day I die. I mean, seriously, who in Galadriel's name actually wants a whole new set of movies built around Gollum?!\n\nThe tragic news hit Middle Earth on Thursday: According to Variety, Warner Bros. -- which is apparently intent on milking this beloved franchise until it is drier than Frodo's skin at the end of Return of the King -- is now working on a new batch of films built around Andy Serkis's shifty-eyed character. The first is set to premiere in 2026. In the words of Smeagol himself, \"AAAAGH! ... You ruins it!\"\n\nThe working title for the first of these films is Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum, which is actually pretty funny because a 2009 fan film already adapted this book lore with the exact same title. (Gollum was also the subject of a terrible video game last year, so it seems we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.) Serkis will both direct and star, according to Variety, and he'll also executive produce alongside Ken Kamins and The Imaginarium's Jonathan Cavendish.\n\nIn a Thursday earnings call, Warner Bros. Discovery and industry Sauron David Zaslav reportedly assured everyone that Peter Jackson and his fellow original trilogy masterminds Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens \"will be involved every step of the way\" for these new films. Then again, Jackson also directed the Hobbit prequels of the 2010s, and frankly, the only aspect of those films that I continue to value is Lee Pace's excellently committed performance as Thranduil the Elvenking. Sorry, not sorry!\n\nAs absurd as this news feels, we've known it was coming for a while; Warner Bros. first announced its intention to create more films inspired by J.R.R. Tolkein's work last February. In this IP-driven era of Hollywood, pretty much every major franchise gets the cinematic universe treatment, from Star Wars to Harry Potter (the latter of which has its own series adaptation on the way from Warners as we speak). All of this to say, this is par for the course.\n\nStill, as someone who used to love Star Wars and can now barely muster the energy to watch the newest entries in a seemingly endless stream of Lucasfilm series, and who still watches the original Lord of the Rings trilogy every Thanksgiving, the news of these new Gollum movies (Gollum movies!?!) has me feeling more exhausted than ever. Must we Marvel-ize the Shire? And what's next -- a limited series about the ents? A prequel series detailing the creation of the Uruk-hai? Let me just stop now before some Warner exec gets any ideas...\n\nAll of this to say, as frustrating as this development might be, it's also, sadly, par for the course. That said, if anyone is assembling a fellowship of nine intrepid LOTR fans to march on Zaslav's office -- and the offices of uninspired film executives everywhere -- feel free to shoot me an email.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Well, a new movie is now in active development as promised, and it's about... Gollum.\n\nThis announcement (via Variety), which arrived on May 9, shouldn't be blindsiding anyone, as Embracer had expressed active interest in developing a new batch of movies as soon as they gained control of the renowned IP. In early 2023, we learned they and New Line Cinema, who'd already handled all six previous Peter Jackson-directed epics, had joined forces to develop the new projects. Now, we also know that Peter Jackson and his creative partners are directly involved in the development of the Gollum-centric prequel tentatively titled The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum.\n\nThe traditional collaboration isn't just bringing back Jackson as producer, as his longtime collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens are also producing and helping develop the script alongside Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou; both had co-written The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, an animated movie set to release this Christmas, before the Embracer acquisition.\n\nUnsurprisingly, together with the premise comes the recruitment of Andy Serkis jumping back into his most famous role ever and also directing the movie after helming Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle and Venom: Let There Be Carnage, two releases that weren't exactly bright, but had a bit of style to them at least. To be fair, if this is the movie Warner Bros. Discovery and Embracer want to move forward with, he deserves to direct it, as it's hard to imagine Jackson's take on the character without him.\n\nAs it stands, Warner Bros. Discovery and Embracer aim to get this one out in 2026, though a more specific release window hasn't been provided. If plans don't change, Christmas 2026 would be a likely spot, as Disney and Lucasfilm are likely to delay the Star Wars movie (likely the Rey-centric one) currently dated for December 18, plus the fourth Avatar will be nowhere near ready to cover for it.\n\nDespite the talent attached to the project, a Gollum prequel is one of the least attractive Lord of the Rings movies we can think of even if we do love the little freak. This also does confirm our fears that Embracer and WB Discovery don't have any exciting ideas for IP at this point and will be just be churning out random spinoffs based on iconic characters for the foreseeable. We wish Serkis the best of luck, but this is feeling more like The Lord of the Slop at the moment.

Discover, provided a surprising update in the world of Middle-earth cinema. The studio had officially signed off on not one but two projects, one of which would be called \"The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum.\" Andy Serkis will be directing, and Peter Jackson (who has made intriguing statements about returning to the franchise in recent history) is signed on to produce the film.\n\nThe real surprise here, though, is that you can already watch a movie called \"The Hunt for Gollum\" -- and it's free. That's right. In 2009, a fan film was made that traced the events that almost certainly will be the subject of Warner Bros.' new film. When we say \"fan film,\" though, we aren't talking about a weekend project shot in someone's backyard with homemade costumes. This is a legit passion project, created by Independent Online Cinema and subtitled \"An Independent Film Inspired by The Lord of the Rings.\" It is shot in high def and features a cast of talented aspiring actors. It has an official soundtrack, stunning scenery (it was filmed in various locations across the United Kingdom), and, above all, a well-demonstrated respect for Tolkien's lore. Oh, and it is 40 minutes long and has over 13 million views on YouTube.\n\nTo be clear, this is a fan film.

So, of course, the next logical question is, what will these new The Lord of the Rings movies be about? Well, the first new The Lord of the Rings movie, The Hunt for Gollum, will focus on the titular character and his adventures. But judging by Warner Bros. Discovery's comments, we'll surely see more than one new movie hit our screens. Details on just how many new Lord of the Rings movies will come our way or what they'll entail beyond the first movie remain slim, though. In fact, we don't yet know the full scope of the rights handed over to Warner Bros. for future movies.\n\nThe Third Age of Middle-earth seems like the most likely setting for many of the new movies, as that's when The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies take place. And Embracer has before name-dropped \"Gandalf, Aragorn, Gollum, Galadriel, and Eowyn,\" primarily Third Age figures, as characters to potentially further explore in film. As we gear up to hear about these new The Lord of the Rings movies, let's take a closer look at Middle-earth's rich world. Here are some of Tolkien's tales and characters that deserve their time to shine.\n\nThe Adventures of Legolas and Gimli After The Fellowship Ends\n\nLegolas and Gimli won hearts and minds with their unlikely friendship in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings movies. But the truth is that they were barely on-screen throughout the trilogy, and their characters didn't receive that much fleshing out. Fans of the characters and of Tolkien's books will know that after the matter of the One Ring concluded, Gimli and Legolas became life partners and traveled together for the rest of their days... Even after Gimli became the Lord of the Glittering Caves.\n\nEventually, Gimli made the greatest journey of all with Legolas. He went west with him, across the ocean, and became the only dwarf to ever travel to the elven realm of Valinor. (Of course, even though Valinor also holds the name of \"The Undying Lands,\" traveling to them does not grant immortality. And Gimli would eventually die.)\n\nAs they say, the tired version of this movie would be a buddy-cop-style outing with lots of snark and orc-killing. But the wired version would be an intricate and passionate romance that spans lifetimes and ends in tragedy, something that feels more like Frank and Bill's episode of The Last of Us. Neither Gimli nor Legolas, The Hobbit's weird interludes aside, even have canonical relationships that would need accounting for. And their relationship is definitely queer in the eyes of Middle-earth. Our eye is fixed on you, Warner Bros.\n\nTom Bombadil's Middle-earth Tales (In Song)\n\nIs this an original suggestion? Maybe not. But it certainly bears noting. Tom Bombadil was excised from the original The Lord of the Rings movies, which makes sense because there are many side-quests and meandering tales in Tolkien's books that couldn't make it into a more streamlined narrative. But fans have always hoped to see him on the screen. Tom Bombadil has a penchant for singing and telling tales and lives in the company of his beloved Goldberry, who is suspected to be a river spirit of sorts. And why not a The Lord of the Rings musical movie in our new slate?\n\nOf course, there's more to it than that. Although he appears a jovial sort, Tom Bombadil has great power. He's implied to be the first living being in Middle-earth, and even the One Ring holds no sway over him. Tom Bombadil is also an other-worldly creature; he'll step in to assist at times but does not have a full understanding of humanity, even less so than the elves. Definitely the kind of character that would be fun to bring to the screen. And we'd love to see the adventures he has in his Brandywine River Valley home play out, complete with appearances from the nefarious Old-Man Willow, the Badger-folk, and even Frodo Baggins himself.\n\nGaladriel, Celeborn, and the Forest of Lothl\u00f3rien\n\nFans of Peter Jackson's films will know that Celeborn much desires to speak with Gandalf... But little else about the elf. In a new The Lord of the Rings movie, maybe we can actually see them get to have a conversation. But in all seriousness, Galadirel and her paramour are subjects of great interest. As is the mysterious forest realm of Lothl\u00f3rien.\n\nGaladriel is getting her day in the sun in The Rings of Power. And that will surely leave fans feeling hungry to know more about her Third Age pursuits, after her Second Age existence and before we meet her as the lady/witch of the wood. Tolkien's books, as is their way, are not completely clear about Galadriel and Celeborn's Third Age activities, but their paths do cross with evil. The Necromancer, a.k.a Sauron, builds Dol Guldur across the river from Lothl\u00f3rien, drawing them to the land. And a Balrog of Khazad-d\u00fbm plays into their eventually assuming of its command.\n\nGaladriel, of course, is also active in the fight against The Necromancer during this time. And she has ties with Gandalf, Saruman, Elrond, and other notable figures, making her the perfect center of a movie, with Celeborn to taste. We'd also love to finally know the mysterious origins of her all-seeing mirror.\n\nGive Glorfindel His Moment in the New Lord of the Rings Movies\n\nGlorfindel's book role in helping the Fellowship transferred to Arwen in the movies, which was a necessary change to the story. But this elf lives quite a cinematic life in Tolkien's writings, one that would suit new The Lord of the Rings movies well. Of course, what we can see on the screen depends on the rights available. But throughout his life, Glorfindel is a mighty warrior with immense power. He dies fighting a Balrog, gets resurrected by Manw\u00eb, and returns to fight again. He does not fear Sauron's ringwraiths, and, in fact, sets up Eowyn's iconic felling of the Witch-King of Angmar. Glorfindel prophecizes that the Witch-King cannot be killed by a man, which, in fact, holds.\n\nGlorfindel also has divine powers and strength in both the seen and the unseen worlds. We see glimpses of the wraiths' world when Frodo puts on the ring, but it would be interesting to visit there more fully.\n\nSaruman's Descent Into Darkness\n\nJust how does Saruman's pristine white blur into many colors? It always feels a little sudden, although we can see the consequences of it creep into the narrative before Frodo ever sets off on his journey. Still, there's nothing like a tale of corruption. At some point, Saruman must have truly been a figure worthy of Gandalf's admiration and trust, but pride and ambition clouded his mind. And then Sauron whispered in his ear, as Sauron always does. At points, Saruman seems to wish to use Sauron as a tool for his own supremacy, and, at others, he yields to the dark lord. This complicated tangle of evil, all mixed up in Saruman's noble origins, would be an interesting one to watch.\n\nBonus: Anything Queer in the New The Lord of the Rings Movies, We Beg of You\n\nThe time for queerness in Middle-earth is now. Actually, the time was a few ages ago, but if we are getting new The Lord of the Rings movies, then there had better be a queer story front and center. Let's be honest -- Middle-earth elves have always been queer icons. You know it, I know it, I bet even Tolkien knew it. So the fact that there isn't even one canonically queer The Lord of the Rings character is a travesty. Even The Rings of Power has yet to introduce a queer character, although it flirts with the relationship between Durin and Elrond quite a bit. And, of course, the show has made many important and welcome changes to the world.\n\nSam and Frodo, Gimli and Legolas, as mentioned above, that's some true love stuff. And Galadriel. Well, Gimli's quote, \"They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods, an Elf-Witch of terrible power,\" basically says it all. Not to mention, fans have thought these thoughts for literal decades. But even if we can't go all the way there with known characters... Please, let's just find a queer story to tell in these new The Lord of the Rings adventures.", "source": {"uri": "nerdist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nerdist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Arda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "History of Arda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galadriel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galadriel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bombadil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Bombadil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valinor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valinor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sauron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_(Middle-earth)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gimli (Middle-earth)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle-earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legolas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Discovery CEO David Zaslav said this morning that the first of two new films based the Lord Of The Rings will be releases in 2026.

Pictures, led by Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, will be revisiting the Lord of the Rings with new films based on the beloved books by J.R.R. Tolkien that became a highly lucrative cinematic franchise helmed by Peter Jackson. He will be back producing, with longtime collaborators Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. It's repped a major piece of business for the studio with Jackson's previous six LOTR films grossing about $6 billion worldwide -- roughly $3 billion for each trilogy.\n\nZaslav didn't reveal any plot points, saying the first film will focus on \"storylines yet to be told.\"\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures has had a nice run this year but Zaslav says it can do more and better in the wake of \"heavy lifting\" by Abdy and Deluca -- and James Gunn and Peter Safran at DC. Their efforts are not yet reflected in the studio numbers, he said, as the company continues to work through \"the remainder of the slate that was in place when we took over the business.\"\n\nHe said storytelling is the heart of the company \"as we strive to return the luster to Warner Bros.

After all, we know the soda has been around for quite some time -- it was first sold in 1885 out of a drug store in Waco, Texas. In fact, Dr Pepper was invented just before both Coca-Cola and Pepsi hit the market. So, it's been a well-established brand in the United States. On top of that, it also has a unique distinction for its mysterious 23 flavors that makes it both sweet and spiced.\n\nBut another reason why Dr Pepper is now number two in the country is due to the brand's social media marketing (remember TikTok's Dr Pepper brownies?) and experimentation with fun new collaborations and products like the Creamy Coconut Dr Pepper that was released this year.\n\n\"Dr Pepper has been gaining, [Pepsi] has been declining, and they're meeting in the middle,\" Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest, said in an interview with CNN.\n\nBut whatever the reason may be, there's one thing we know for sure -- Ladd's love of Dr Pepper will never change!", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dr Pepper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage_Digest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverage Digest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pepsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waco, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waco, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_brownie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate brownie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Food_and_Drink_Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Food and Drink Related", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Naturopathy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Naturopathy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Spicy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Spicy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_pioneer_woman_178/b51fe30b4a090da930799ab2b69db39d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9631085", "eventUri": "eng-9631085", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, even Warren Buffett is a believer in beverage stocks, as shown by his significant, longtime stake in Coca-Cola. In fact, the Oracle owns 400 million shares of the soda maker and has owned the company's stock since way back in 1988.\n\nHere are three beverage stocks that are well-positioned to produce big returns for investors.\n\nVita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) beverages are fairly healthy as they are based on coconut water. According to Healthline, coconut water is \"naturally sweet and hydrating,\" while it is also \"loaded with several important nutrients, including minerals that many people don't get enough of.\" And unlike coconut milk, coconut water contains very little fat. Additionally, several studies show the beverage could be more efficient than water when it comes to helping people recover from exercise sessions. Vita Coco heavily utilizes the latter aspect of the liquid in its marketing campaigns.\n\nThose efforts are bearing some fruit (no pun intended) as the company's top line jumped to $493.6 million last quarter last year from $427.8 million in 2022. Moreover, its operating income soared over five times to $56.9 million in 2023 from $10.4 million in 2022. Meanwhile, analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to advance to 94 cents this year from 79 cents in 2023.\n\nLarge investors also appear to be warming up to the name as COCO stock climbed 22% from Apr. 22 to Jun. 4.\n\nI view Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) as having found a \"Holy Grail\" of sorts because its beverages are healthy, don't use artificial sweeteners, have very few calories, taste rather good and provide a tremendous amount of energy via caffeine.\n\nIts products include large amounts of important vitamins. For example, its Live Fit offerings have 90% of the FDA's Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for Vitamin C, 130% ofor Riboflavin, and 120% for B6.\n\nLast quarter the company's revenue jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier. That growth enabled its top line to reach $355.7 million. Further, its earnings per share more than doubled year-over-year to 27 cents.\n\nLately, the Street has shunned its shares, largely because its growth has slowed slightly, according to Nielsen. But retail demand for the company's product is increasing and the placement of its beverages is improving. Also importantly, Celsius is in the process of expanding to multiple, significant overseas markets.\n\nAccording to Beverage Digest, Dr Pepper last year overtook Pepsi to become America's second favorite soft drink. Specifically, Dr Pepper and Pepsi both commanded 8.3% of the soft drink market in 2023, with Dr Pepper holding a slight edge. Buffett's Coca Cola remained way ahead of both of the other two firms with a 19.2% share.\n\nThe news is certainly positive for Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) which, of course, manufactures and markets Dr Pepper. The data suggests the company is doing a very good job of marketing its soda. What's more, the news itself has given the company a great deal of free publicity.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on CNBC's Halftime Report on Jun. 4, Jenny Van Leeuwen Harrington, the CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, said the new weight loss drugs could cause consumers to cut back on Keurig Dr Pepper's Keurig pods. But I believe that the opposite could very well be true. That's because as consumers drink fewer sugary drinks that give them energy, they could turn more to low-calorie coffees to obtain energy instead.\n\nAlthough consumers on the weight loss drug are likely to drink less regular Dr Pepper, many are likely to switch to Diet Dr Pepper instead.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_ramer@investorplace.com", "name": "Larry Ramer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coconut water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molson_Coors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molson Coors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Beverage", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monster Beverage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coconut milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dietary Reference Intake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_substitute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sugar substitute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_B6", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin B6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin C"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caffeine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riboflavin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calorie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keurig_Dr_Pepper", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keurig Dr Pepper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Beverages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Beverages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Publicly_Traded", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Publicly Traded", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ko-stock-1600-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9631085", "eventUri": "eng-9631085", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "dateEnd": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1601, "textEnd": 1618}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 3272, "textEnd": 3278}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-02-", "textStart": 72, "textEnd": 85}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 169, "textEnd": 183}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Last year, it captured 19.2% of the soda market in the United States by volume, Beverage Digest's data shows. Dr Pepper and Pepsi both had 8.3%, with Dr Pepper technically ahead. After that came other brands owned by Coca-Cola: Sprite came in at 8.1% and Diet Coke at 7.8%.\n\nWhile \"Dr Pepper has been gaining, [Pepsi] has been declining, and they're meeting in the middle,\" said Duane Stanford, editor of Beverage Digest, in an interview with CNN.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And while the two cola giants battled it out in the 20th century, Dr Pepper established a small but devoted following in the American South.\n\nFor years a regional favorite, Dr Pepper in the 1970s marketed itself to a national audience as a unique flavor. Over the years, it has gained traction with a national audience.\n\nToday, Dr Pepper is experimenting with new flavors. The brand introduced Dr Pepper Strawberries & Cream last year. The addition was \"a standout success,\" Timothy Cofer, CEO of Dr Pepper parent company Keurig Dr Pepper, said during an analyst call in April. The brand has also rolled out trendy limited-time flavors, like Dr Pepper Creamy Coconut, inspired by TikTok's dirty soda trend (mixing soda with milk or cream and other flavors).\n\nBut the brand doesn't have to do too much to be on trend. \"Swicy,\" or sweet and spicy, items are taking over the food and beverage aisle. Even Coca-Cola wants in: The company in February introduced Coca-Cola Spiced, a rare permanent addition to the lineup of Coke flavors.\n\nPepsi, on the other hand, may have been too focused on its other brands. Unlike Coca-Cola and Keurig Dr Pepper, Pepsico has a massive food business -- its sprawling portfolio includes Quaker, Frito-Lay and more.

{"id": 243230088, "title": "Hong Kong weatherman turned rap star, 74, brings the heat with track targeting fast fashion", "text": "Veteran Hong Kong weatherman Lam Chiu-ying has long been a familiar face raising awareness in the city about climate change and telling people to stop using air conditioners. Now, at 74, he has gained new attention as a rapper, using Cantonese hip-hop music to press home a message on environmental protection and overconsumption. The former director of the Observatory teamed up with singer-songwriter Luna Lee Chui-ting, 29, known to fans as \u201cLuna Is A Bep\u201d, to create a snappy number titled \u201cBuy Less Buy Better\u201d. For their music video, which premiered on YouTube on June 5, Lam shed his standard white shirt and grey trousers to don sunglasses and a retro-style shirt and jacket. And for his debut as a rap artist, he called himself \u201cChiu-ying Gor\u201d, meaning \u201cBrother\u201d Chiu-ying. The song has a serious message about fast fashion and wasteful overspending on cheap, trendy and mass-produced clothes. Lam and Lee chose the theme to highlight that fashion is the world\u2019s third-most polluting industry, with carbon emissions accounting for 8 per cent of the global total. \u201cIt is a significant contribution to the deteriorating climate, and it is fast growing,\u201d Lam said. With the repeated catchphrase \u201cbuy less, buy better\u201d, the 2\u00bd-minute video has garnered nearly 31,000 views and 1,900 likes as of Friday evening. Musician Lee hoped the song would remind people to shop wisely and support local businesses instead of blindly following fashion trends. Her lyrics go: \u201cI choose class over craze. Smart spending saves the day. Cheap clothes rarely look good, you don\u2019t even have to say it, I\u2019d know.\u201d She hoped people would opt for locally made, better quality clothes that last longer. \u201cThere is a lower carbon footprint and it\u2019s good for the environment,\u201d she said. One viewer said in the comments section: \u201cThank you for your contribution to the world. However small this step may seem, changes are possible as long as you believe.\u201d Lam said he was \u201cover the moon\u201d when he was invited to collaborate with Lee, whose songs focus on social issues including the Covid-19 pandemic, capitalism and smartphone addiction. He admitted that it was not easy getting the hang of rapping, and thanked Lee for her \u201clove, tolerance and forgiveness\u201d. But Lee praised her partner, saying: \u201cChiu-ying Gor is also a very clever man and [revealed] so much wisdom in our conversations and interaction.\u201d Lam led the Observatory from 2003 to 2009, and was chairman of the government-appointed Environmental Campaign Committee between 2013 and 2018. During his 35-year career, he helped establish the \u201cvery hot weather\u201d and \u201ccold weather\u201d warnings, and set up the Friends of the Observatory platform for the sake of public education and to promote science. In 2008, an asteroid was named after him in recognition of his efforts to raise public awareness of climate change. Well-known for his abhorrence of air conditioners, he has been dubbed by conservationists as the face of the city\u2019s environmental protection movement. Hong Kong spends about HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) on air conditioning annually, which amounts to 30 per cent of the overall electricity consumption, according to official data. The city experienced its hottest summer on record last year, when the temperature hit an average of 29.7 degrees Celsius (85.5 Fahrenheit) between June and August. Hong Kong recorded temperatures of 34 degrees on June 21 this year, making it the hottest summer solstice since 1980 Lam said that over the past couple of years, people kept needling him, asking if he had given up the fight and \u201csecretly switched on the air conditioner\u201d. \u201cSome said: \u2018Since you do not switch on the air conditioner, I will switch it on and turn the temperature a few degrees down,\u2019\u201d he told the Post, adding that he knew they were just having a bit of fun. \u201cPeople understand why I don\u2019t switch on the air conditioner.\u201d That was why Lee added a verse to the song that caught the Internet\u2019s attention: \u201cStop asking whether I have switched on my air conditioner. I will tell you when I have switched it on.\u201d As an internet influencer, Lam has shared his views on environmental policies, including the government\u2019s waste-charging scheme which was shelved last month. \u201cIf you are not paying now, you will pay for it later by suffering from the heat,\u201d he warned. Blaming the government\u2019s publicity strategy for the failure to press ahead with the scheme, he said: \u201cChanging people\u2019s habits is very difficult. But if we reason it out and convey the message in a way people understand, we can do it.\u201d Lam said working with Lee on the rap song and video gave him new hope for Hong Kong\u2019s younger generation. \u201cPeople of my generation tend to see young people like this \u2013 they don\u2019t work, they just play around,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that is a totally wrong perspective. They really want to change the world in one way or another.\u201d Lam, who has two sons, said he now considered Lee a daughter. \u201cI look at her, talk to her, and I feel much more hopeful about tomorrow,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Former Observatory director Lam Chiu-ying teams up with singer-songwriter Luna Lee and scores a hit.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3268538/hong-kong-weatherman-turned-rap-star-74-brings-heat-track-targeting-fast-fashion", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/29/c91cf7e5-b942-4ee1-b043-1ea0a8be72b1_c29c9375.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:57:24", "author": "Ezra Cheung,Sammy Heung", "authors": ["Ezra Cheung", "Sammy Heung"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.363}

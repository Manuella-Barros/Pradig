Working with a short leash Wednesday, the reigning Cy Young Award winner proved he was up for the challenge. He was sharp, with a touch of rust, over four-plus innings in front of a sellout crowd at Yankee Stadium, though New York would go on to lose 7-6 in 10 innings.\n\nThe right-hander was charged with two runs on three hits. He compiled five strikeouts to one walk. He threw 62 pitches and induced six swing-and-misses. His average fastball velocity was down 1.6 mph from last season, but he still touched 97 mph.\n\n\"I felt pretty good,\" Cole said. \"Good command for the most part. And made some good pitches when we needed to make some good pitches.\"\n\nCole took the mound for his long-awaited return at 7:07 p.m. to cheers after a video montage was played on the big screen highlighting his debut. It began with a couple of bumps.\n\nThe Orioles inflicted most of their damage against Cole in the first inning. Gunnar Henderson led off the game with a one-hopper that bounced off second baseman Gleyber Torres' glove into right field and was ruled a double. Two batters later, Ryan O'Hearn, facing an 0-2, slashed a slider for a two-out, RBI ground-rule double.\n\nCole quickly regrouped. He needed just seven pitches to retire the side in the second inning. He issued a one-out walk to Henderson in the third. Henderson stole second base on the next pitch but was stranded there as Cole recorded his first three strikeouts of the season in the inning.\n\nCole retired the side in order with two strikeouts in the fourth frame on 16 pitches. He took the mound for the fifth inning but was pulled for reliever Ron Marinaccio after surrendering a first-pitch single to Cedric Mullins. The crowd showered Cole with a standing ovation. Cole, visibly annoyed with the end of his performance, acknowledged the supporters with his glove twice.\n\nThen he watched Marinaccio yield a two-run home run to Ramon Urias for the second of the two runs on his pitching line.\n\n\"I thought he got better as he went,\" said Boone, who noted he sensed Cole was fatigued after the fourth inning.\n\nBefore the game, Boone declined to share Cole's pitch limit, not wanting to give the Orioles a competitive edge. But Cole was obviously going to be limited after he was built up to 68 pitches over 4\u2153 innings in his third and final rehab start Friday.\n\nBoone said the goal was to build up Cole \"conservatively.\" On Wednesday, that meant a 65-pitch limit, Boone said after the game. Asked what his pitch limit would be in his next outing, Cole echoed his manager's competitive disadvantage line. But he did offer a hint: \"More.\"\n\n\"I'm tired now,\" Cole said. \"Certainly a different level. It just demands a higher level of focus and execution. I definitely felt I could keep making pitches, but it was strategic in the pitch count. And, certainly, in that regard we executed that perfectly.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O'Hearn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan O'Hearn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_rule_double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ground rule double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleyber_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gleyber Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Mullins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Mullins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0620%2Fr1348025_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664125", "eventUri": "eng-9664125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Three things we learned about the return of the Yankees' ace", "body": "NEW YORK -- For nearly three months, the New York Yankees trampled expectations without their ace, Gerrit Cole. They posted the best record in the majors while the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner served as an unofficial assistant pitching coach because of an elbow injury.\n\nBut the Yankees know reaching the ultimate goal -- winning the franchise's 28th World Series title and first since 2009 -- almost certainly requires a healthy Cole on the mound in October.\n\nCole's season debut Wednesday night in a 7-6, 10-inning loss to the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium was a significant checkpoint. And the results were encouraging: Four-plus innings, two runs on three hits, and five strikeouts to one walk. Most importantly, Cole emerged healthy. It was a positive, if abbreviated, step in the right direction.\n\nHere are three things to take away from Cole's first start of the 2024 season.\n\nCole made just three rehab outings in preparation for Wednesday. The pitch counts: 45, 57, 68. The Yankees would've been justified in having Cole make one more start in Triple-A to build up further. But they decided Cole was ready enough to use those bullets against their chief competition in the AL East. And they were right.\n\nCole's average fastball velocity was down 1.6 mph from last season, he gave up some hard contact, and he had trouble putting a few batters away, but he was very sharp given the circumstances. The right-hander threw 62 pitches, 40 for strikes. He induced six whiffs and 13 called strikes, with full command of his five-pitch arsenal.\n\n\"I think the location was good,\" Cole said. \"And I felt like the pitches were crisp. I think I got a swing-and miss on every offering. The consistency probably has to progress as well with the pitch count. I threw a couple of wonky sliders, but made a great slider in a big spot. It's encouraging.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, it took some time for Cole to find his footing. His season started with some loud contact. Gunnar Henderson led the game off with a 109.1-mph one-hopper that bounced off second baseman Gleyber Torres' glove and into right field for a double. Two batters later, Ryan O'Hearn barreled an 0-2 slider for a 102.3-mph, two-out RBI ground-rule double.\n\nFrom there, Cole settled in, retiring nine of the next 10 batters he faced. He retired the side in the second inning on just seven pitches. He walked Henderson in the third inning -- and watched Henderson steal second base -- but registered his first three strikeouts of the season and left Henderson stranded. The Orioles went down in order on 16 pitches in the fourth.\n\n\"I thought he got better as the game went along,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nThe Orioles hit six pitches at least 101.5 mph., but the costly damage was limited to those two doubles in the first inning and Cedric Mullins' leadoff single in the fifth. That allowed Cole to average just over 15 pitches per inning, an economic output on a night when he needed to be economical to avoid overstressing the bullpen ahead of Thursday's rubber game.\n\nCole exited to a standing ovation in the fifth, with Mullins on base and the game tied at one. Reliever Ron Marinaccio promptly surrendered a two-run home run to Ramon Ur\u00edas. The Yankees would rally to tie late in the game, so Cole didn't factor in the decision. It wasn't a vintage Cole performance, but that was never on the menu.\n\n\"It was nice,\" Cole said of making his return. \"It was kind of a special game for me, a little bit. It's just been a long few months and a lot of emotions. I wasn't too sure how I was going to feel out there, but locating the ball quells the nerves a little bit.\"\n\nCole left the game angry with himself for throwing a high fastball to Mullins to start the fifth inning and end his outing. He explained that was why he looked so frustrated as he left the game -- not because he wanted to stay in the game longer.\n\nCole recalled throwing a fastball away to Mullins in their first clash that produced a lineout to center field. He wasn't pleased with the location the next time around against the veteran center fielder.\n\n\"He's ready for it,\" Cole said of Mullins. \"I have like 30 at-bats against him. He put a good swing on it and got up the middle and so probably just a little frustration with the cat and mouse. Cedric got me again on a high fastball.\"\n\nMullins is now 9-for-26 with two doubles and a home run in 27 career plate appearances against Cole.\n\nBefore the game, Boone refused to divulge Cole's pitch count, asserting that sharing the information would create a competitive disadvantage. It turns out the number was 65, which was why Boone pulled Cole after just one pitch in the fifth inning.\n\nBoone said he sensed Cole was fatigued after the fourth inning, but he wanted Cole to face one more batter.

Working with a short leash Wednesday, the reigning Cy Young Award winner proved he was up for the challenge. He was sharp, with a touch of rust, over four-plus innings in front of a sellout crowd at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe right-hander was charged with two runs on three hits. He compiled five strikeouts to one walk. He threw 62 pitches and induced six swing-and-misses. His average fastball velocity was down 1.6 mph from last season, but Cole still touched 97 mph.\n\nBefore the game, Yankees manager Aaron Boone declined to share Cole's pitch limit, not wanting to give the Orioles a competitive edge. But Cole was obviously going to be limited after he was built up to 68 pitches over 4\u2153 innings in his third and final rehab start Friday.\n\n\"We'll build him conservatively here to get him built up,\" Boone said. \"And, frankly, with all our guys we'll kind of see where they're at and what we feel like makes the most sense. But I don't necessarily think it'll be extra moving forward. It'll just be conservatively getting [the pitches] up. But, then again, listening to each start, too, to see where he is.\"\n\nCole took the mound at 7:07 pm to cheers after a video montage was played on the big screen highlighting his debut. \"The Return of Gerrit Cole\" was long-awaited. It began with a couple of bumps.\n\nThe Orioles inflicted most of their damage against Cole in the first inning. Gunnar Henderson led the game off with a one-hopper that bounced off second baseman Gleyber Torres' glove into right field and was ruled a double. Two batters later, Ryan O'Hearn, facing an 0-2, slashed a slider for a two-out, RBI ground-rule double.\n\nCole quickly regrouped. He needed just seven pitches to retire the side in the second inning. He issued a one-out walk to Henderson in the third. Henderson stole second base on the next pitch but was stranded there as Cole recorded his first three strikeouts of the season in the inning.\n\nCole retired the side in order with two strikeouts in the fourth frame on 16 pitches. He took the mound for the fifth inning but was pulled for reliever Ron Marinaccio after surrendering a first-pitch single to Cedric Mullins. The crowd showered Cole with a standing ovation. Cole, visibly annoyed with the end of his debut, acknowledged the supporters with his glove twice.\n\nThen he watched Marinaccio yield a two-run home run to Ramon Urias for the second of the two runs on his pitching line.", "source": {"uri": "insider.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com (Insider)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O'Hearn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan O'Hearn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Mullins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Mullins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_rule_double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ground rule double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleyber_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gleyber Torres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0620%2Fr1348025_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664125", "eventUri": "eng-9664125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Baltimore (48-25) now stands 1.5 games behind New York (51-25) for first-place in the AL East.\n\nBut the Yankees -- who built the AL's best record without the services of their best pitcher -- are only stronger now with Cole's return and can feel good about his first effort of the season against big-league hitters.\n\nCole pitched four innings, allowing three hits, one walk and two earned runs while recording five strikeouts. His four-seam fastball maxed out at 97 mph, a touch higher than his average fastball velocity of 96.7 mph in 2023.\n\nHe threw 61 pitches through four innings of one-run baseball then returned for the fifth. He allowed a first-pitch single to Cedric Mullins, and his day was done after 62 pitches.\n\nManager Aaron Boone played it safe with his ace and replaced him with reliever Ron Marinaccio. Marinaccio allowed a home run to Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas on the next at-bat, and Cole was tagged with his second earned run of the night as the Orioles took a 3-1 lead. Cole wasn't pleased with being pulled or the Orioles pulling ahead, but there was plenty to like about his first start of 2024.\n\nCole started the night allowing a leadoff double to Gunnar Henderson. Second baseman Gleyber Torres had a chance to make a play the ground ball, but it bounced off his glove into right field, allowing Henderson to reach second base. Henderson came around to score on a Ryan O'Hearn ground-ruled double with two outs.\n\nCole finished his first inning back with 10 strikes in 13 pitches while allowing two hits and one earned run. Then he settled in.\n\nCole made quick work of the side in a 1-2-3 second inning that required seven pitches. He led off the third with his first strikeout of the season. Jorge Mateo swung and missed at a third-strike cutter off the plate.\n\nHe then walked Henderson on eight pitches for his first and only free pass of the night. Two more strikeouts concluded the third. He sat down Adley Rutschman and Ryan Mountcastle on strikes for a three-strikeout inning to complete his second turn through the top of the Orioles order.\n\nCole then cruised in the fourth with two strikeouts in a 1-2-3 inning. After inducing a leadoff lineout from O'Hearn, he retired both Anthony Santander and Colton Cowser swinging with 96 mph fastballs at the top of the zone.\n\nHe then briefly returned for the fifth, when he was pulled after his first pitch.\n\nCole started this season on the injured list after experiencing nerve inflammation and swelling in his pitching elbow. He avoided Tommy John surgery and has been gearing up in rehab starts in recent weeks. The Yankees called him up for Wednesday's game after he recorded 19 strikeouts and zero walks across 12 1/3 innings in three minor-league rehab starts.\n\nBarring any setbacks, he's now back in the rotation and should gradually see his pitch count increase as the Yankees set their sights on the AL East crown and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

The goal for Wednesday, even more than winning, will be ensuring Cole makes it through the outing OK.\n\n\"There's going to be watchful eyes on him because we certainly want Gerrit Cole for the entire season,\" Ausmus said. \"This is a great first step because we need him back in the rotation. It's good to have him here.\"\n\nIf there is any kind of downside to the Yankees welcoming back arguably the best pitcher in baseball, Ausmus joked about losing essentially another coach in the dugout during the days he starts. Cole has been around the club plenty, Gil recently referring to him as a \"professor.\"\n\n\"We're going to miss his coaching abilities in the dugout,\" Ausmus said.\n\nAusmus assumed managerial duties for much of the game because Boone attended his son Brandon's high school graduation.\n\nBoone returned to the dugout mid-game and was driving to the Stadium, listening to the game on the radio, when Aaron Judge was hit.\n\n\"He wants to watch the graduation, be able to see his son after the graduation is over, take some pictures and then he'll make his way back to the Stadium,\" said Ausmus, who has five years of managerial experience and who had filled in after Boone's three ejections this season.\n\nIncluded in a busy day of transactions was shifting Clarke Schmidt to the 60-day injured list.\n\nSchmidt, sidelined with a right lat strain, is not eligible to return until July 26.\n\nBoone said the team is still waiting to learn the severity of top prospect Jasson Dominguez's oblique injury with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\nAfter allowing nine stolen bases against the Red Sox on Sunday -- the most they had given up in over a century -- the Yankees limited Baltimore to one.\n\nThe Yankees welcomed the recipients of the 2024 Yankees-Stonewall scholarships onto the field to watch batting practice and be featured in a pregame ceremony.\n\nThe Yankees-Stonewall Scholarship Initiative awards $50,000 worth of scholarships to \"student leaders who have demonstrated academic achievement, a commitment to equality and impactful support for the LGBTQ+

He struck out 10, gave up two hits and allowed one unearned run over 4.1 innings.\n\nIn total, Cole racked up just one earned run with 19 strikeouts and no walks over 12.1 innings over his three starts, and the Yankees are seeing all they need on the radar gun and the stat sheet to know he is ready to join the club.\n\nThe Yankees were waiting to make the call for Cole to start Wednesday, as manager Aaron Boone noted it would have been Cody Poteet again making the start. He has been in the rotation since Clarke Schmidt hit the injured list with a lat strain.\n\nThis series against the Orioles is a highly anticipated one, as Baltimore has kept pace with the team owning the best record in MLB this season. The Yankees are looking for a little divisional revenge after dropping two of three to the Boston Red Sox in their first meeting of the campaign.\n\nThe Yankees, however, have not just gotten through this first half of the schedule without their best starter - they have thrived. Luis Gil has been the team's ace, owning the best ERA in the American League at 2.03 on the season. That is why he is the frontrunner to win Rookie of the Year.\n\nAlso, the resurgence of Carlos Rodon, the addition of Marcus Stroman and the work by Nestor Cortes, Schmidt and Poteet have made this rotation one of the best in baseball.\n\nIt is only expected to get better with Cole rejoining his teammates, and the Yankees will hope he can have quick success to keep the ball rolling heading toward the All-Star break.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCole is the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner after leading the league with a 2.63 ERA over 209 innings.

Across four innings of work, Cole turned in strong and encouraging work against one of the best offenses in all of baseball.\n\nCole got off to a bit of a shaky start, as he permitted a pair of hard-hit doubles and a run in the first inning. Then he mostly grooved through the next handful of frames and wound up with the following line:\n\nGerrit Cole NYY * SP * #45 vs. BAL, 6/19/24 IP4H3R2ER2SO5BB1Pitches62Strikes40 View Profile\n\nHere's a look at strikeouts four and five:\n\nEncouraging for Cole and the Yankees is that his fastball topped out at 97.5 mph. Overall, the 28 fastballs he threw averaged 95.1 mph. That's down a bit from his usual levels, but it's nothing concerning given that he's still getting stretched out. When it comes to his secondaries, Cole leaned on his knuckle-curve and cutter and also threw his slider - one of them at better than 90 mph - and changeup. Across his 16 batters faced, Cole earned six whiffs and 13 called strikes.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone permitted Cole to come out for the fifth inning, perhaps after some dugout persuasion:\n\nCole's night was over after he permitted a lead-off single on a humpback liner off the bat of Cedric Mullins. He departed with the score 1-1. Reliever Ron Marinaccio was unable to strand Mullins, as Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas hit a two-run homer to give the visitors a 3-1 lead. Marinaccio allowed another run before finally escaping the fifth.\n\nWhat's impressive - and what's been a key driver in the first-place Yankees' success thus far - is that the remainder of the rotation has thrived in Cole's absence. Coming into their ace's 2024 debut, Yankees starters led all of baseball with a rotation ERA of 2.86, and just the rotations of the Phillies and the Padres had racked up more strikeouts. In particular, 26-year-old right-hander Luis Gil has been a breakout revelation for the Yanks this season with his AL-leading ERA of 2.03.\n\nNow, though, they have their ace back, and Wednesday's season debut suggests it won't be long before Cole is delivering Cy Young-caliber results once again.\n\nAssuming he remains on a normal schedule, Cole's next start would come on Tuesday against the cross-town Mets in Citi Field.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dayn_perry@cbssports.com", "name": "Dayn Perry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Marinaccio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron Marinaccio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckle_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knuckle curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Mullins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Mullins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Fitness", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/20/86a1e35b-203b-44ee-b949-c7443d76d2f7/thumbnail/1200x675/5c34cb913c69d628c893e42d3b19b14e/usatsi-gerrit-cole-yankees.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664125", "eventUri": "eng-9664125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

But the Yankees -- who built the AL's best record without the services of their best pitcher -- are only stronger now with Cole's return and can feel good about his first effort of the season against big-league hitters.\n\nCole pitched four innings, allowing three hits, one walk and two earned runs while recording five strikeouts. His four-seam fastball maxed out at 97 mph, a touch higher than his average fastball velocity of 96.7 mph in 2023.\n\nHe threw 61 pitches through four innings of one-run baseball then returned for the fifth. He allowed a first-pitch single to Cedric Mullins, and his day was done after 62 pitches.\n\nManager Aaron Boone played it safe with his ace and replaced him with reliever Ron Marinaccio. Marinaccio allowed a home run to Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas on the next at-bat, and Cole was tagged with his second earned run of the night as the Orioles took a 3-1 lead. Cole wasn't pleased with being pulled or the Orioles pulling ahead, but there was plenty to like about his first start of 2024.\n\nCole started the night allowing a leadoff double to Gunnar Henderson. Second baseman Gleyber Torres had a chance to make a play, but the ball bounced off his glove into right field, allowing Henderson to reach second base. Henderson came around to score on a Ryan O'Hearn ground-ruled double with two outs.\n\nCole finished his first inning back with 10 strikes in 13 pitches while allowing two hits and one earned run. Then he settled in.\n\nCole made quick work of the side in a 1-2-3 second inning that required seven pitches. He led off the third with his first strikeout of the season. Jorge Mateo swung and missed at a cutter off the plate\n\nHe then walked Henderson on eight pitches for his first and only free pass of the night. Two more strikeouts concluded the third. He sat down Adley Rutschman and Ryan Mountcastle on strikes for a three-strikeout inning to complete his second turn through the top of the Orioles order.\n\nCole then cruised in the fourth with two strikeouts in a 1-2-3 inning.

Despite the extra innings loss to the Baltimore Orioles, 7-6, the Yankees ace and manager Aaron Boone talk about the former Cy Young winner's outing and how he feels going in to the rest of the season.\n\nIt has been a long time since Cole pitched at a major league level as his last outing was on last Sept. 27 against the Toronto Blue Jays and even that game showed off his skills by throwing a shut out. After Wednesday's game however, he described it as a \"special\" performance as he has been awaiting the moment he returns to the mound after months of waiting patiently according to Bill Ladson of MLB.com.\n\n\"It was kind of a special game for me a little bit,\" Cole said about Wednesday's outing. \"It has been a long few months, a lot of emotions. I wasn't too sure how I was going to feel out there, but locating the ball quells the nerves a little bit.\"\n\nIn the outing against the Orioles, he threw four innings while striking out five batters, and allowed two earned runs, three hits, and a walk. It was an impressive return despite having been named the Opening Day starter back before the season, but it of course had to be delayed because of the elbow injury.\n\nBoone speaks on Cole's return outing for the Yankees\n\nThere is no doubt that as Cole sees more action in games, his workload will come back to being normal for New York's ace and perform at a high level, even if his comeback outing was not stellar. Yankees manager Aaron Boone spoke after the game about Cole's performance and said he \"thought he threw the ball well.\"\n\n\"I thought Gerrit was good, I thought he got better as he went,\" Boone said. \"I thought he was under control and I thought as the outing went on, he got a little bit better, and had a little bit of everything. Got a strikeout with the breaking ball, flashed a good slider for a strikeout. I thought the cutter was a good pitch for him all night. Reached back for some heaters that he executed as well. So all in all, I thought he threw the ball well.\"\n\n\"I thought he did a good job in the third inning with that runner on second and you are kind of [facing] the meat of the order,\" Boone continued. \"He kind of slowed the game down really well, he was really under control, he started to get the strikeout ball a little there.\"\n\nCole on what needs to be improved on, plus what worked\n\nThere was a feeling from Boone that Cole started to get tired by the fourth inning which the endurance will no doubt get better as he logs more innings. Still, the 33-year old found a lot to like with his start as he thought his location and slider were up to his standards, but acknowledges there is still stuff to work on.\n\n\"For the most part, the location was good. I felt like the pitches were crisp,\" Cole said. \"The consistency probably has to progress as well with the pitch count. There might be give and take as we keep going. We threw a great slider in a big spot. That's encouraging.\n\n\"For the most part, I made some good pitches when we needed to make some pitches,\" Cole continued. \"There was a fair amount of adrenaline, which is nice to have. A few too many high fastballs, but for the most part, it was a good jolt.\"\n\nCole getting more work as the season goes on for New York\n\nIt will be interesting to see the progression from Cole as even Boone revealed what would be a pitch count limit for the star heading into Wednesday's game which was at 65 according to ESPN. For what the limit will be in the next one, Boone or Cole would not reveal any number, except for saying it will no doubt be \"more.\"\n\n\"I'm tired now,\" Cole said. \"Certainly a different level. It just demands a higher level of focus and execution. I definitely felt I could keep making pitches, but it was strategic in the pitch count. And, certainly, in that regard we executed that perfectly.\"\n\nAt any rate, the Yankees pitching had been stellar this season as they have a MLB-low 3.41 runs per game allowed. It also has shown in their record as New York has the best in the majors as they are 51-25 with their next game Thursday evening when they face the Orioles in the final game of the series, looking for a win.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_weinberger@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Zachary Weinberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gerrit-Cole-speaks-out-after-excellent-season-debut-vs.-Orioles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664125", "eventUri": "eng-9664125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-27", "textStart": 555, "textEnd": 563}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He jogged onto the field before innings and waved at his three-year-old son, Caden, after them, just as he usually does. But the surest sign that Gerrit Cole was back came after he had allowed one run over four innings, then let Baltimore Orioles center fielder Cedric Mullins single to lead off the fifth. Out came New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone to relieve his ace, who was pitching for the first time in 266 days. And out came Cole's signature sullen look.\n\nCole knew perfectly well that he would not be allowed to throw more than 65 pitches, that he would only see one batter in the fifth. He knew that it would make sense to ramp him up slowly after he suffered nerve irritation and edema in his throwing elbow in spring training. But for a guy who admitted afterward that he was wiped, he still seemed pretty cranky to see his manager come get him.\n\n\"Cedric does a really good job on the high fastball,\" Cole said after it was over and the Yankees had lost 7-6 in 10 innings. \"There's risk-reward up there, pressuring him with it. We did a good job in the first at bat, locating one down and away, managed the launch angle. [Mullins lined to center.] He obviously put the barrel on it, but that's a high-percentage out. And then we attacked him with the fastball up in the second at bat. And he's ready for it. And he's always been-I have, like, 30 at bats against him. He put a good swing on it and got it up the middle. Just a little frustration with a cat and mouse. You know, Cedric got me again on a high fastball.\"\n\nCole grinned. He is done rehabbing. He is ready to resume pitching.\n\nThe 47,155 in the ballpark understood the significance of the moment. At 51-25, the Yankees carry the best record in the sport, but they seem to lose a player to injury every day. The crowd cheered along to a hype video celebrating \"the return of Gerrit Cole\" and gave him an ovation as he took the mound. The fans extended to the dugout: Even shortstop Anthony Volpe admitted he'd been closely tracking Cole's rehab progression.\n\n\"I think having the best pitcher in baseball influences how you approach the whole week,\" he said.\n\nCole expected the adrenaline rush-indeed, after he threw 70 pitches in his final rehab start, the team lowered his pitch count for this start to account for the extra juice-and he spent all week psyching himself up so that it would not overwhelm him when it arrived.\n\n\"It was kind of a special game for me, a little bit,\" he said. \"It's just been a long few months and a lot of emotions, so I wasn't too sure how I was gonna feel out there. But locating the ball always quells the nerves a little bit.\"\n\nCole began the game with two wide fastballs, then grooved a cutter that Gunnar Henderson smacked at second baseman Gleyber Torres, who could not make the play and had to watch as it became a double. Cole retired the next two, then allowed a ground-rule double to score a run. He retired 10 of the next 12 hitters, striking out five, and left the game to an ovation.\n\nThe Orioles made some hard contact, hitting six balls hit harder than 100 mph, but also swung and missed six times. Cole's fastball averaged 95 mph, down from 96.7 mph last year, but he seemed to have a feel for all his pitches. He threw his cutter, last year his fifth-favorite offering, 23% of the time, and he retired catcher Adley Rutschman in the third with an impressive sequence after falling behind 3-1: a changeup at the knees for a called strike two, then a curveball that dotted the outside corner for a called strike three.\n\nRighty Ron Marinaccio, summoned in relief, allowed Cole's run to score, plus two of his own. Victor Gonz\u00e1lez gave up another. A thrilling comeback push, ignited when DH Giancarlo Stanton clubbed a three-run homer in the seventh and then singled in the tying run in the bottom of the ninth, fell short after closer Clay Holmes allowed two runs in the 10th. New York came within one, but left fielder Jahmai Jones struck out looking with a runner on first to end it.\n\nStill, Cole was the story of the day. He lobbied the team to let him make this start against the Orioles, the Yankees' main competition in the American League East, instead of an additional rehab outing. \"The team kind of catered to me to a certain extent,\" he said. So he tried to be reasonable about the pitch count. (He acknowledged that he was proud he had gone four innings, extending the rotation's streak of such outings to 76, the longest in franchise history.)\n\nHe declined to speculate on how deep he would go in his next start, except to say, \"More.\" You can bet that however many that ends up being, he will feel it wasn't enough.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Gerrit Cole

The Yankees' ace allowed three hits and two runs over his four-plus innings, striking out five with one walk in his 62-pitch return.\n\nHe gave up some hard contact -- the Orioles smacked six balls over 100 mph, including five in the first two innings, and a pair of doubles that scored a run in the first. But Cole's own velocity was encouraging, as his 95.1 mph average was still a tick below last year's norm (96.7) and he maxed out at 97.5 mph. Numbers to build on.\n\nBy Game 2 of this pivotal Bronx showdown, Cole's health status -- everyone's primary concern since his spring-training elbow scare -- had taken a backseat to the simmering tensions left over from Tuesday night's series opener, when the O's used Aaron Judge and Gleyber Torres for target practice.\n\nTorres was the lucky one. The fastball he took off his left pinkie from reliever Keegan Akin left a mark, but no lasting damage. Judge wasn't quite as fortunate.\n\nThe Yankees captain got drilled on the side of his left hand by O's starter Albert Suarez in the third inning, then had to exit the game in the fourth for X-rays and a CT scan. Both came back negative, much to the Yankees' relief, but the swelling and soreness kept Judge out of the lineup Wednesday and potentially for Thursday's finale as well.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, Judge dodged a bullet, if not that 94-mph fastball. But that didn't make the Yankees any less angry about seeing their captain and MVP grimacing in pain, or the prospect of losing him for an extended period of time.\n\nSo after the Yankees nailed down the 4-2 victory Tuesday, and vented some of that irritation, it was only natural to wonder if this AL East rivalry was about to boil over for the middle game -- particularly with Cole next up.\n\nThe wise move? That was de-escalation on the Yankees' part, mainly due to the guy on the mound. Under normal circumstances, with Cole at the peak of his powers, he could certainly handle the role of enforcer. But payback can be a slippery slope, with things spiraling out of control quickly, and Cole's first priority has to be making it as far as he can, as effectively as he can.\n\nThis isn't Somerset or Scranton anymore. The Orioles aren't a bunch of awestruck minor-leaguers. Cole may be the reigning Cy Young winner, but he was also making his '24 debut in mid-June, nearly three months after sweating the possible need for Tommy John surgery (it turned out to be nerve inflammation inside the elbow).\n\nIt's been a long road back. And while the Yankees' rotation has surprisingly excelled in Cole's absence -- the starters' 2.86 ERA is the best in the majors -- they aren't winning a title without their fully-functioning ace. Or maybe even the division. Better for Cole to continue his build-up minus any unnecessary drama. Treat Wednesday's debut as the launching pad for his Cy Young defense.\n\n\"He's an enormous part of our team and an enormous part of our culture,\" manager Aaron Boone said before the game. \"To have him work his way back to this point is exciting for all of us, but I also don't want to get too emotionally invested in all that. It's a process still, to get him where we need to get him, but we feel like he's in a really good spot and throwing the ball really well.\"\n\nThis isn't Cole's first rodeo. He's an 11-year veteran who had racked up five top five Cy Young finishes before finally claiming the trophy last season. Cole understands the critical aspects of throwing inside, and the need for protecting his teammates. He's not above the extracurricular stuff either.\n\nA year ago, almost to the day, Cole got fed up with the Mariners' Jose Caballero messing around between pitches, so he rifled a fastball way over his head that sailed to the backstop. Back in 2022, Cole got into a heated shouting match with the Blue Jays' Alek Manoah -- who nailed Judge -- and triggered an incident that prompted some players to spill from their dugouts.\n\nCole runs hot. It's the nature of having a Cooperstown-level compete factor. He also is cognizant of his leadership role on these Yankees, which is near or equal to Judge's stature, even without the official C designation. Both of those elements figured to be in play Wednesday when Cole faced the Orioles, but as Boone mentioned, the reins are still fairly tight on his ace.\n\nSo Cole did the right thing in showing restraint during Wednesday's debut. He exited in the fifth inning to a standing ovation, and big picture, that was a more welcome sight than knocking down any Orioles.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Still, some new wrinkles were added to his routine, such as lighting a scented candle near his locker. The habit has become popular with Yankees starters since Marcus Stroman was introduced to the clubhouse.\n\nCole could also be seen trying on and stretching out his jersey, as this year's new Nike uniforms have come with plenty of complaints. Aside from that, though, he enjoyed a normal pregame as Boone tried to tone down the enthusiasm.\n\n\"There's been a lot of building excitement,\" the manager said before the Yankees' 7-6, 10-inning loss to the Orioles. \"At the same time, I just want him to build properly, get off to a good start and not overhype one start. It's a step along the way for him and for us.\"\n\nWhile Boone sought to minimize the pageantry, public address announcer Paul Olden made sure to welcome Cole back when lineups were announced. That message received a loud ovation from the Bronx faithful before a Cole-centric highlight video appeared on the jumbotron.\n\nMinutes later, Cole threw his first pitch of the season, a 94.2-mph cutter to Gunnar Henderson that didn't come close to the strike zone.\n\nHenderson went on to double when a well-struck, bouncing grounder ricocheted off of Gleyber Torres' glove. Ryan O'Hearn eventually drove Henderson home with a ground-rule double.\n\nThe O's had few hard-hit balls in the first, but Cole escaped the inning after just 13 pitches. He totaled 62, completing four frames while tallying three hits, two earned runs, one walk and five strikeouts. The first three strikeouts came in the third inning.\n\nWhile Cole threw 70 pitches in his third and final rehab start, he was on a more restrictive count while incorporating the added adrenaline and stress that comes with competing at the major league level.\n\n\"We'll build him conservatively,\" Boone said.\n\nCole threw 28 four-seamers, 13 cutters, 11 knuckle-curves, five changeups and five sliders against the Orioles. His fastball averaged 95.1 mph and maxed out at 97.5 mph.\n\nThe right-hander was charged with a second run when his replacement, Ron Marinaccio, surrendered a home run to Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas with an inherited runner on base. That runner, Cedric Mullins, ended Cole's night with a single. Another O'Hearn double gave the Orioles a fourth run in the fifth.\n\nIn the seventh, Ryan Mountcastle provided an insurance run with a double. Henderson scored on the two-bagger after getting hit by Victor Gonz\u00e1lez earlier in the inning. Yankees fans celebrated the plunking after Aaron Judge, absent from Wednesday's lineup, took a fastball to his left hand on Tuesday.\n\nThe Henderson hit-by-pitch bit the Yankees, but they cut Baltimore's lead to one in the bottom of the seventh when Giancarlo Stanton crushed a three-run homer to Monument Park. Stanton then tied the game at five in the ninth when he singled home Anthony Volpe, who led the inning off with a double.\n\nHowever, the Orioles retook the lead on a Cedric Mullins single in the 10th. A Jose Trevino throwing error brought Mullins home after he stole third.\n\nA Ben Rice sac fly got the Yankees one more run in the 10th, but that wasn't enough.\n\nWhile Baltimore tied the series in dramatic fashion, getting a healthy Cole back is a huge boost for one of baseball's best rotations. Yankees starters led the majors with a 2.86 ERA before Wednesday's game, and that was without Cole ever throwing a pitch.\n\n\"He's the reigning Cy Young and an enormous part of our team and an enormous part of our culture,\" Boone said. \"So to have him kind of work his way back to this point to be ready to go out there and compete on this level is exciting, certainly for all of us. But also, you don't want to get too emotionally invested in all that as well. It's a process still getting him to where we need to get him, but I feel like he's in a really good spot and throwing the ball really well.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news",

Now they hope they can avoid having to play without Aaron Judge.\n\nWhile Cole will make his highly anticipated season debut on Wednesday, the Yankees are holding their breath on Judge's condition as they host the Baltimore Orioles in the second contest of a three-game series between the top two teams in the American League.\n\nCole is returning from right elbow inflammation that cost him New York's first 75 games.\n\nIt's unclear if the lineup behind him will include Judge, who was hit in the left hand by a pitch from Albert Suarez during the third inning of the Yankees' 4-2 win on Tuesday. The New York captain initially stayed in and played center field in the top of the fourth but was replaced by Trent Grisham when his turn came up in the bottom half.\n\nJudge scored on a single by Giancarlo Stanton. After being lifted, he underwent an MRI exam and CT scan, neither of which showed a fracture.\n\n\"It's a big relief,\" he said. \"Just being hit there before a couple of years ago and breaking my wrist, you never know what's going to happen. So finding out that it's not fractured, not broken, is definitely a sigh of relief.\"\n\nBaltimore shortstop Gunnar Henderson said of the major league's home run leader getting plunked, \"Obviously you don't want to see that. He's an unreal hitter and you got to make difficult pitches and (Suarez) just kind of unfortunately went up in and in. I hate to see it, but I hope he's out there soon.\"\n\nCole is returning after three minor league rehab starts in which his pitch count increased each time. The Yankees decided to pencil in Cole after he pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings and struck out 10 for Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre at Rochester on Friday. In the three outings (two for Double-A Somerset and the one for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre), Cole yielded two runs, one earned, while striking out 19 and walking none in 12 1/3 innings.\n\nCole is returning after dominating the 2023 AL Cy Young Award race in New York's worst season since 1992. While the Yankees went 82-80, Cole finished 15-4 and led the AL with a 2.63 ERA and 209 innings to go along with 222 strikeouts in 33 starts.\n\n\"I'm very much wanting to get back very, very soon,\" Cole said after his final rehab start. \"What a fun club that they are right now so yeah, that's part of the reason why I'm just trying to make sure that I'm in a good spot to help them.\"\n\nCole is 5-3 with a 2.55 ERA in 12 career starts against the Orioles. He had a 3.75 ERA in two no-decisions against Baltimore last season.\n\nThe Orioles avoided being blanked on Tuesday when Anthony Santander homered in the ninth inning, but they wound up hitless in five at-bats with runners in scoring position. Baltimore also is dealing with an injury concern after Jordan Westburg exited following the top of the second due to left hip discomfort following a collision with Yankees baserunner Juan Soto.\n\n\"His hip's pretty sore,\" Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said postgame. \"Right now he's day-to-day with a hip contusion, but we'll see how he feels (Wednesday).\"\n\nThe Orioles have starting pitchers John Means, Tyler Wells, Kyle Bradish and Dean Kremer on the injured list, prompting them to dip into their farm system.\n\nCade Povich (0-1, 4.76 ERA) is among the replacements, and he will make his third career start on Wednesday. Povich allowed six runs in 5 1/3 innings at Toronto on June 6 in his major league debut but followed up with six scoreless innings of five-hit ball in Baltimore's 4-2 home win over the Atlanta Braves on June 12.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@deadspin.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author",

Or something that figures to be close enough as long as his elbow does not betray him.\n\n\"Good command for the most part,\" Cole said. \"Made some good pitches when we needed to make some good pitches.\"\n\nCedric Mullins secured his fate with a leadoff single in the fifth inning. It was the first hit allowed by Cole since the initial shaky first inning. Ron Marinaccio later gave up a two-run home run to Ramon Urias, making Cole the potential losing pitcher at that moment.\n\nFortunately, Cole's teammates rallied behind him, ensuring he wouldn't end up with the loss that night. Even though Aaron Judge was sidelined due to a hand injury, Clay Holmes gave up two runs in the 10th inning, resulting in a 7-6 victory for the Orioles.\n\nGiancarlo Stanton had a pivotal moment in the game when he crushed a three-run homer in the seventh, reducing the deficit to 5-4. Alex Verdugo also made a crucial play by making a running backhand catch against the wall in center field, saving the team from further damage in the ninth inning with the bases loaded. Stanton later singled in Anthony Volpe in the ninth against Craig Kimbrel, tying the game at 5-5. The tensions escalated when two Orioles players were hit by pitches following the injury scare involving Judge.\n\nAaron Boone was hopeful that Cole could temper the inevitable adrenaline that would accompany his season debut.\n\nBoone sensed that Cole was fatigued by the end of the fourth and had no intention of letting him exceed 65 pitches.\n\n\"It was kind of a special game for me,\" Cole said. \"It's just been a long few months and a lot of emotions. I wasn't too sure how I was gonna feel out there.

He fanned Jorge Mateo leading off on a 92 mph cutter. And got Adley Rutschman looking on a called 3-2 knuckle curve with Henderson at second. After getting a called strike on a 3-1 changeup. And excused Ryan Mountcastle on a slider.\n\n\"I got a swing and miss on every offering,\" Cole said.\n\nBoone had gotten Marinaccio up in the bullpen in the fourth. Then Cole struck out Santander on a 95 mph four-seamer up in the zone and Colton Cowser on a 96 mph four-seamer.\n\n\"He's one of those guys that every time he starts it's must-see TV,\" Verdugo

Cole's comeback is highly anticipated following his impressive rehabilitation stint in the minor leagues, where he showcased his readiness to rejoin the major league roster.\n\nDuring his time in rehab, Cole pitched 12.1 innings across three appearances between Double-A and Triple-A, achieving a stellar 1.13 ERA and striking out 19 batters. His return could not be more timely, especially with Cody Poteet recently landing on the injured list due to a triceps issue. Although Clarke Schmidt is still out with a lat strain, the Yankees' rotation has maintained excellent form in Cole's absence, boasting the best ERA in the league at 2.86, ranking third in strikeouts with 404 and third in innings pitched with 425.\n\nLuis Gil, in particular, has been outstanding, contributing significantly with a 2.03 ERA over 80 innings this season. His performances have helped keep the team competitive and in strong standing within the league.\n\nAs Cole gears up for his first major league game of the season, expectations are set for him to pitch about five or six innings. This cautious approach will help gauge his endurance and effectiveness without pushing him too hard on his first outing back. In one of his rehab games with Triple-A Scranton, Cole threw 4.1 innings and struck out ten batters, indicating that his form is close to optimal.\n\nThe Yankees have planned for Cole to throw around 75 pitches in his return game against the Orioles, who are known for their potent offense. This strategic pitch count will help manage his workload while testing his readiness to handle competitive action.\n\nAs the Yankees integrate Cole back into their starting rotation, his performance on Wednesday will be critical not only for his own confidence but also for the team's strategy moving forward. The Yankees are hopeful that Cole's return will reinforce their pitching staff and maintain their momentum as they continue their pursuit for a championship season.", "source": {"uri": "empiresportsmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Empire Sports Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_wilson@empiresportsmedia.com", "name": "Alexander Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Poteet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Poteet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_Schmidt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clarke Schmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://empiresportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Baseball-Hartford-Yard-Goats-vs-Somerset-Patriots-yankees-gerrit-cole-23471789.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664125", "eventUri": "eng-9664125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

He jogged onto the field before innings and waved at his three-year-old son, Caden, after them, just as he usually does. But the surest sign that Gerrit Cole was back came after he had allowed one run over four innings, then let Baltimore Orioles center fielder Cedric Mullins single to lead off the fifth. Out came New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone to relieve his ace, who was pitching for the first time in 266 days. And out came Cole's signature sullen look.\n\nCole knew perfectly well that he would not be allowed to throw more than 65 pitches, that he would only see one batter in the fifth. He knew that it would make sense to ramp him up slowly after he suffered nerve irritation and edema in his throwing elbow in spring training. But for a guy who admitted afterward that he was wiped, he still seemed pretty cranky to see his manager come get him.\n\n\"Cedric does a really good job on the high fastball,\" Cole said after it was over and the Yankees had lost 7-6 in 10 innings. \"There's risk-reward up there, pressuring him with it. We did a good job in the first at bat, locating one down and away, managed the launch angle. [Mullins lined to center.] He obviously put the barrel on it, but that's a high-percentage out. And then we attacked him with the fastball up in the second at bat. And he's ready for it. And he's always been -- I have, like, 30 at bats against him. He put a good swing on it and got it up the middle. Just a little frustration with a cat and mouse. You know, Cedric got me again on a high fastball.\"\n\nCole grinned. He is done rehabbing. He is ready to resume pitching.\n\nThe 47,155 in the ballpark understood the significance of the moment. At 51-25, the Yankees carry the best record in the sport, but they seem to lose a player to injury every day. The crowd cheered along to a hype video celebrating \"the return of Gerrit Cole\" and gave him an ovation as he took the mound. The fans extended to the dugout: Even shortstop Anthony Volpe admitted he'd been closely tracking Cole's rehab progression.\n\n\"I think having the best pitcher in baseball influences how you approach the whole week,\" he said.\n\nCole expected the adrenaline rush -- indeed, after he threw 70 pitches in his final rehab start, the team lowered his pitch count for this start to account for the extra juice -- and he spent all week psyching himself up so that it would not overwhelm him when it arrived.\n\n\"It was kind of a special game for me, a little bit,\" he said. \"It's just been a long few months and a lot of emotions, so I wasn't too sure how I was gonna feel out there. But locating the ball always quells the nerves a little bit.\"\n\nCole began the game with two wide fastballs, then grooved a cutter that Gunnar Henderson smacked at second baseman Gleyber Torres, who could not make the play and had to watch as it became a double. Cole retired the next two, then allowed a ground-rule double to score a run. He retired 10 of the next 12 hitters, striking out five, and left the game to an ovation.\n\nThe Orioles made some hard contact, hitting six balls hit harder than 100 mph, but also swung and missed six times. Cole's fastball averaged 95 mph, down from 96.7 mph last year, but he seemed to have a feel for all his pitches. He threw his cutter, last year his fifth-favorite offering, 23% of the time, and he retired catcher Adley Rutschman in the third with an impressive sequence after falling behind 3-1: a changeup at the knees for a called strike two, then a curveball that dotted the outside corner for a called strike three.\n\nRighty Ron Marinaccio, summoned in relief, allowed Cole's run to score, plus two of his own. Victor Gonz\u00e1lez gave up another. A thrilling comeback push, ignited when DH Giancarlo Stanton clubbed a three-run homer in the seventh and then singled in the tying run in the bottom of the ninth, fell short after closer Clay Holmes allowed two runs in the 10th. New York came within one, but left fielder Jahmai Jones struck out looking with a runner on first to end it.\n\nStill, Cole was the story of the day. He lobbied the team to let him make this start against the Orioles, the Yankees' main competition in the American League East, instead of an additional rehab outing. \"The team kind of catered to me to a certain extent,\" he said. So he tried to be reasonable about the pitch count. (He acknowledged that he was proud he had gone four innings, extending the rotation's streak of such outings to 76, the longest in franchise history.)\n\nHe declined to speculate on how deep he would go in his next start, except to say, \"More.\" You can bet that however many that ends up being, he will feel it wasn't enough.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

from a playoff spot, so all Cole was pitching for was an elusive Cy Young Award, which finally was not so elusive.\n\nA lot changed in the 266 days between starts, among them Cole's warmup song.\n\nIn his long-awaited season debut, the ace chose a melodic tune from R\u00fcf\u00fcs Du Sol with an appropriate refrain: \"There's no place I'd rather be.\"\n\nAfter missing nearly the first 12 weeks of the season with nerve inflammation and edema, Cole finally was back where he belonged.\n\nThe star right-hander made a successful 2024 debut Wednesday when Cole mostly looked like Cole.\n\nIn four-plus innings against the Orioles in The Bronx, Cole was charged with two runs on three hits, a walk while striking out five.\n\nHe was hit hard in the first inning -- when a Gunner Henderson smash glanced off Gleyber Torres' glove and went for a double, and Henderson came around to score on a Ryan O'Hearn double -- but he got stronger as the night wore on.\n\nFive of his six outs in the third and fourth innings came via strikeouts.\n\nBut Cole, who made just three minor league rehab starts, is still building up.\n\nHe took the mound for the fifth inning but was allowed just one pitch, a Cedric Mullins single to left field.\n\nHe walked off after 62 pitches to loud cheers, but silence soon followed: Ron Marinaccio entered and allowed a two-run home run to Ram\u00f3n

His fastball sitting 94-96 mph and peaking at 97, Cole struck out five, all of them coming from the third inning on.\n\n\"Not bad,\" one rival AL scout said. \"After the first inning most of his stuff got better. Just needs to get his legs under him.\"\n\nCole, on a strict pitch count of 60-65 as the Yankees brought him to the majors to continue his buildup, threw 62 pitches, 40 for strikes. His line was made slightly worse when, after Cedric Mullins singled on his 62nd pitch, a 95-mph fastball leading off the fifth, Ron Marinaccio allowed a two-run homer to Ramon Urias that gave the Orioles a 3-1 lead (Baltimore added a third run later in the inning to make it 4-1).\n\n\"He's the reigning Cy Young, an enormous part of our team, an enormous part of his culture, so to have him kind of work his way back to this point, to be ready to go out there and compete on this level, is exciting, certainly for all of us,\" Aaron Boone said before the game of Cole's return to a rotation that has, for the most part this season, thrived in his absence. \"But, also don't want to get too emotionally invested in all that as well. It's a process still getting him to where we need to get him, but feel like he's in a really good spot and throwing the ball really well.\"\n\nThat was Boone's way of tempering expectations somewhat as Cole breezed his way through three minor league rehab starts, including a 10-strikeout performance Friday night with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\nAs if on cue, it took the Orioles 12 pitches to get on the board in a 13-pitch first.\n\nCole's first pitch to leadoff man Gunnar Henderson was a 94-mph fastball that came in a bit outside and his second pitch, also a 94-mph fastball, also was a ball, putting him in a 2-and-0 hole.\n\nHenderson then smoked a cutter that one-hopped off Gleyber Torres' glove at second, the ball skittering into right for a double.\n\nCole got a called first-pitch strike with a 97-mph fastball to Adley Rutschman and eventually retired the catcher on a pop to short. Ryan Mountcastle grounded to second, which moved Henderson to third. Cole got ahead of Ryan O'Hearn 0-and-2 before the designated hitter slashed a slider into the gap in left-center for a ground rule double that made it 1-0.\n\nThe Yankees came right back as Baltimore lefthander Cade Povich had little command, throwing 32 pitches in the inning (though he gave up just one run).\n\nAnthony Volpe singled sharply to center and Juan Soto grounded into a 4-6 force. Giancarlo Stanton walked on four pitches and Alex Verdugo walked on five pitches to load the bases. Torres, in a 6-for-35 (.171) skid, got ahead 2-an-0, battling for 11 pitches before lifting a sacrifice fly to left to tie it at 1-1. DJ LeMahieu struck out looking to end the inning.\n\nCole needed just seven pitches to get through the second. Colton Cowser popped out, Mullins lined to center and Urias hit a bullet to the hole at short where Volpe, sliding on the grass, backhanded it on a hop, then gunned it to rookie call-up first baseman Ben Rice, who made a nice scoop for the third out. Cole pointed emphatically at Volpe in appreciation before walking off the mound.\n\nPovich's command was only better by a degree in the bottom half. He walked Trent Grisham and Volpe back-to-back with two outs and fell behind Soto 3-and-1. The rightfielder grounded to third but Povich was already at 56 pitches.\n\nCole's first strikeout came leading off the third when he struck out former Yankee Jorge Mateo swinging at a 2-and-2 cutter. Cole walked Henderson with one out and the shortstop stole second. He fell behind Rutschman 3-and-1 before striking the catcher out looking at a curveball. He struck out Mountcastle swinging at a slider for the third out.\n\nOn a roll, Cole needed 15 pitches to get through a 1-2-3 fourth. He retired O'Hearn on a fly ball to center, then struck out Anthony Santander and Cowser swinging at 96-mph fastballs.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"},

Still, some new wrinkles were added to his routine, such as lighting a scented candle near his locker. The habit has become popular with Yankees starters since Marcus Stroman was introduced to the clubhouse.\n\nCole could also be seen trying on and stretching out his jersey, as this year's new Nike uniforms have come with plenty of complaints. Aside from that, though, he enjoyed a normal pregame as Boone tried to tone down the enthusiasm.\n\n\"There's been a lot of building excitement,\" the manager said before the Yankees' 7-6, 10-inning loss to the Orioles. \"At the same time, I just want him to build properly, get off to a good start and not overhype one start. It's a step along the way for him and for us.\"\n\nWhile Boone sought to minimize the pageantry, public address announcer Paul Olden made sure to welcome Cole back when lineups were announced. That message received a loud ovation from the Bronx faithful before a Cole-centric highlight video appeared on the jumbotron.\n\nMinutes later, Cole threw his first pitch of the season, a 94.2-mph cutter to Gunnar Henderson that didn't come close to the strike zone.\n\nHenderson went on to double when a well-struck, bouncing grounder ricocheted off of Gleyber Torres' glove. Ryan O'Hearn eventually drove Henderson home with a ground-rule double.\n\nThe O's had few hard-hit balls in the first, but Cole escaped the inning after just 13 pitches.

Through this injury he's been around talking to us in between innings, going over things with us after game, pregame, just giving us his knowledge and tidbits. He's so dialed in when it comes to baseball analytically and mechanically, so when he talks he's the type of dude you listen.\n\n\"So just having him around just gives you confidence, especially when he's telling you certain things about your game, it only makes you more motivated when you go out there. I've been a fan of his from afar, and to be up close and personal, it's been something to admire.\"\n\nCole, returning from spring training elbow inflammation, will make his season debut on a sweltering Wednesday night against the Orioles under Aaron Boone's watchful eyes.\n\n\"He obviously brings a lot on the field but he brings a lot off the field,\" Clay Holmes told The Post. \"He was able to kinda pour into his teammates, things that he's always done, just maybe had a couple of more seconds to do it I guess.

That's just how engaged he is.\n\n\"This whole little couple of months just reinforced the things I think a lot of us knew about him already.\"\n\nFormer Red Sox outfielder Alex Verdugo was to play behind Cole for the first time.\n\n\"He really cares not only about the way he gets ready, but about all the pitching staff, all the guys he's always kind of watching and just giving his opinions and views, and I feel like usually they're right,\" Verdugo said.\n\nAaron Judge is the captain, and deservedly so. Cole has similar leadership qualities.\n\n\"Just a really great guy, one that's constantly wanting to share feedback and wisdom and how to get better, not afraid to ask stuff to make himself better from teammates, and just always striving to be great,\" Luke Weaver told The Post, \"and I think that is infectious, and I think he's definitely a vocal leader and he's also a leader by example.\"\n\nHis teammates were thrilled for Cole winning the 2023 Cy Young.\n\n\"There's not a stone he really leaves unturned,\" Holmes said. \"You see somebody that that's talented that puts that much energy into it. ... I mean, you just root for him, especially when he has as much potential as he does. He has more than enough capabilities to win a Cy Young. You want that to come true for him. It was definitely a cool moment just to see all that come to fruition and see him get rewarded for it.\"\n\nThe Yanks entered the night 16-2 in Cole's Stadium starts.\n\n\"He's one of those guys that every time he starts it's must-see TV,\" Verdugo said. \"Everything he throws he has a good understanding of what he's trying to do and what kind of pitch characteristics he wants.\"\n\nAustin Wells caught Cole in spring training and raved about his fastball.\n\n\"The way that it moves and the way it comes out of his hand and the way he's able to command it, it just makes everything else that much better, too,\" Wells told The Post.\n\nGetting their ace back wasn't only an emotional boost to the Yankees. Stroman knows what it would mean to the opposing pitcher, starting on Wednesday night with Baltimore's Cade Povich.\n\n\"He's an ace, he's a Cy, so I feel like anytime you're going against him you know that you're gonna have to be at your best in order to go out there and put your team in a position to win because I feel like he's someone who's pretty much always at his best,\" Stroman said. \"There's a reason he's been doing it for so long at such a high level. I never take that for granted, especially someone who's been in a while. I admire the guys like Gerrit Cole, like Zack Wheeler, like Aaron Nola, guys who go out there and give you 200 innings each and every year ... Logan Webb. I just think those guys are the most valuable for their teams. And like I said, Gerrit, he's so dialed in when it comes to analytics, he's like essentially having another coach around.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrit_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerrit Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Stroman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Stroman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Verdugo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Verdugo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Weaver_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Weaver (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Webb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wells", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Wells"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/new-york-yankees-starting-pitcher-84064900-e1718836401509.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664125", "eventUri": "eng-9664125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

all of them coming within the last eight batters he faced.\n\nAfter a lengthy rehab from right elbow nerve irritation, which rocked Yankees Universe in spring training, Cole was making his 2024 debut against the team closest in the standings to the AL East-leading Yankees.\n\nThe reigning unanimous AL Cy Young Award winner had thrown 70 pitches in his third and final minor league rehab start, last Friday, and it was uncertain how many pitches he'd be permitted to throw Wednesday.\n\n\"We'll build him conservatively here and...see where we're at and what makes the most sense,'' said Yankees manager Aaron Boone, before the game.\n\nAccording to MLB Statcast, Cole's fastball topped out at 97.5 mph, averaging at 95.1 mph.\n\nThe percentage breakdown of Cole's 62 pitches: 45 percent four-seam fastballs, 21 percent cutters, 18 percent curveballs, eight percent changeups, eight percent sliders.\n\nIn the third inning, Cole faced four batters and struck out the side -

a 109.1-mph one-hop bullet that glanced off second baseman Gleyber Torres' glove and into right field.\n\nThree batters later, Ryan O'Hearn drove an 0-2 slider for a ground-rule RBI double to left.\n\nCole's next start could be Tuesday at Citi Field against the Mets on one extra day of rest, due to Monday's team off date.\n\n\"He's not fully built up yet, but there's been a lot of building excitement toward that,'' said Boone. \"Just want him to build properly, get off to a good start and not overhype one start.\n\n\"It's a step along the way for him and for us and, we're looking forward to him getting back out there.''", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Mullins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Mullins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Mountcastle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Mountcastle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O'Hearn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan O'Hearn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adley_Rutschman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adley Rutschman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleyber_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gleyber Torres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664125", "eventUri": "eng-9664125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Which, despite all fears to the contrary, has gone just fine without the 33-year-old.\n\nThough Wednesday's tilt with the Baltimore Orioles will mark the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner's first start of 2024, the Yankees boast MLB's best record at 51-24. It's mainly the arms that have carried them, as New York hurlers lead MLB with a 2.99 ERA.\n\nTo this extent, at least, Cole can make the rich even richer. He merely needs to pick up where he left off in 2023, wherein he led the AL in innings, ERA, WHIP and WAR.\n\nAh, but it's in the bigger picture where the greater stakes reside. The Yankees may be sitting pretty, but the concept of ace starting pitchers is under siege and badly in need of Cole's help.\n\nYour Favorite Ace Is Probably Having a Bad Year\n\nTo quickly recap where Cole has been, it's because of inflammation in his $324 million elbow that he's only now making his 2024 debut.\n\nThough two-and-a-half months is a long time to miss, \"inflammation\" and \"elbow\" being in the same sentence doesn't always lead to such good outcomes. To wit, 17 major league hurlers have undergone Tommy John surgery since the initial news of his injury broke in March.\n\nThis is to say he's one of the lucky ones in what's been a very bad year for name-brand aces.\n\nWhether you peruse a list of the best pitchers since 2018 -- on which Cole ranks second with 29.7 WAR -- or one of recent Cy Young Award winners, it's remarkable how many pitchers on either or both haven't been a factor in 2024:\n\nIt's a grim picture even if you ignore the guys who haven't been factors in the way they would like. Blake Snell (6 GS, 9.51 ERA) won't be winning a third Cy Young Award, and it hasn't been a banner year for Justin Verlander (10 GS, 3.95 ERA and now two separate IL stints) or Kevin Gausman (14 GS, 4.08 ERA).\n\nThat Gausman is the only one among this bunch who hasn't spent time on the injured list only adds to the general feeling of hopelessness emanating from all the pitching injuries this year. Even MLB's most reliable pitchers don't feel that reliable anymore.\n\nMercifully, Cole offers real hope of being a bright spot the rest of the way. He's the only one here who's coming off the best season of his career and not coming back from surgery.\n\nStill, the six-time All-Star won't merely be trying to win one for his fellow aces. The eyes of all of starting pitcherdom will be upon him.\n\nStarting Pitching Is Strong. Starting Pitchers Are Broken.\n\nHeck, you might even call this the Year of the Breakout Pitcher.\n\nThere are unusual suspects aplenty in the Cy Young Award races, with Tarik Skubal, Luis Gil and Tanner Houck chasing it in the American League and Ranger Su\u00e1rez and Sh\u014dta Imanaga pushing for it in the National League.\n\nAnd we're all a little in love with Paul Skenes, who's making a bid for the NL Rookie of the Year with a 2.29 ERA through seven starts.\n\nThen again, who says a good year for starting pitching must also be a good year for starting pitchers?\n\nOf the top 25 starters in 2023, only Logan Webb, Sonny Gray, Zac Gallen, Zack Wheeler, George Kirby, Corbin Burnes and Luis Castillo have been as good or better in 2024. Which isn't necessarily surprising. There was likewise little cross-pollination between the 2023 leaderboard and the 2022 leaderboard, and ditto with the latter and the 2021 leaderboard.\n\nGreat starting pitchers have basically become interchangeable. And part of the problem, it seems, lies in how an older generation of aces hasn't been followed by the next generation.\n\nConsider the list of the best starters for the last seven seasons, starting with 2018 and extending to this year. Of the top six, only Aaron Nola made his major league debut within the last 10 seasons. Out of the top 10, none debuted after 2017.\n\nPlenty of guys have come along and shown promise only to fall prey to injuries and other career-altering mishaps. Think Walker Buehler. Lucas Giolito. Shane McClanahan. Alek Manoah. Jack Flaherty. Michael Soroka. Spencer Strider. And on and on.\n\nCall it an inevitable outcome of how the broader culture of pitching has evolved to become increasingly obsessed with velocity. An endless pursuit of it at the highest levels of the sport feeds a destructive cycle at its lowest levels. Youth is no longer any guarantee of pitching vitality, and it's not getting better.\n\n\"Everybody comes to me, 'My kid's pretty good.' I'm like, 'How old is he?' And they're like, '7.' And they're already sending him to places that are just there to increase velocity,\" Verlander told Ken Rosenthal and Jayson Stark of The Athletic. \"I've always equated mechanics and how you throw to a horse's gait. You're a kid. You naturally figure things out.\"\n\nThat the broader institute of starting pitching is nonetheless putting up a fight against extinction could be seen as the bright side. But if the institute keeps changing faces over and over and over again, well, what's the point?\n\nNone of us get any enjoyment out of the numbers on the bottom line being within acceptable parameters. We all want to see guys become stars, stars become superstars and superstars become legends.\n\nWith starting pitchers, anything beyond that first step feels increasingly out of reach.\n\nIs Cole Up to Playing the Savior?\n\nAs bad as things are now, there's a version of the future in which they're even worse. And this is the one in which Cole returns only to not be the Cole of old.\n\nAlarmist much? He was the most consistently great pitcher of the last six full seasons, pitching to a 2.93 ERA overall and placing in the top 10 of the AL Cy Young Award voting annually. His three minor league rehab outings were decidedly Cole-like. He pitched 12.1 innings and allowed one earned run with 19 strikeouts against zero walks.\n\nYet the gap between the minors and the majors is greater than it used to be, and Cole's fastball is worthy of suspicion. His tracked heaters in the minors averaged 94.6 mph. That's 2.1 mph below where he sat in 2023, which was a 1.1 mph decrease from 2022.\n\nThe Yankees could actually be in trouble if Cole isn't his usual self. Though their pitchers got by just fine without him, their good fortune with men on base has begun to turn and certain individuals are not without warning signs. Notably, Gil is already 16 innings away from a new professional high and Marcus Stroman has more walks than strikeouts in June.\n\nApologies for catastrophizing, but it's hard not to when one feels like one is watching a certain era become bygone in real time.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that we had guys such as Greg Maddux, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez. It was even shorter ago when Roy Halladay, CC Sabathia and F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez were appointment viewing every fifth day. And still shorter ago when guys like Kershaw, Scherzer, deGrom and Verlander were in their primes.\n\nWhat feels like the last stand of the ace pitcher is nonetheless here. And if Cole can't lead the charge, maybe nobody can.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_d_rymer@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Zachary D.

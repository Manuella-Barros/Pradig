The 24-year-old also chose not to take part in a group photo in which both teams stood behind a banner in support of the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe Malian player could have received a ten-match suspension under the disciplinary scale of the French Football Federation. \"We take note of the decision of the League which we respect and we will not appeal this decision,\" Monaco's general manager Thiago Scuro told AFP.\n\nThe Riviera outfit, which had apologized and indicated possible internal sanctions against the player, did not assist Camara before the commission. \"Our concern was above all to deal with this situation, to make our club's position clear on the subject, and to explain to Mo (Camara) that his behavior could be different,\" continued Scuro.\n\n\"Monaco supports the action of the League, the fight against discrimination, the action against homophobia, it is clear for us, it is also clear for Mo.\" After the game earlier in May, Scuro said that Camara did not take part in the campaign \"for religious reasons\". \"It's a very sensitive subject at all levels, because we also have to respect all religions.

Nor had he participated in the pre-match protocol photo where the two teams of Monaco and Nantes posed in front of the slogan symbolizing the fight against homophobia.\n\n\"Such behavior must be subject to the strongest sanctions both against the player but also against the club which committed it let it happen\", the Minister of Sports Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra estimated the day after the match.\n\nMohamed Camara, on the other hand, received the support of Malian personalities and many compatriots on social networks, in the name of respect for personal and religious convictions. The Malian Football Federation itself assured the player of its support, \"in the exercise of his freedom of expression and its corollary, (that) of not not express yourself\".\n\nFor his part, Yoann Lemaire, from the 'association \"Foot Ensemble\" had demanded an exemplary sanction, hoping that she \"is intelligent\", by suggesting to the discipline to propose to Camara \"awareness workshops at the Monaco training center\".

But as an organisation, we are very sad about this episode and we want to make it clear that we do not support this.\"\n\nMonaco head coach Adi Hutter said after the game: \"I would like to say that we, as a club, support the operation organised by the league. For his part, it was a personal initiative. There will be an internal discussion with him about this situation. I will not comment further.\"\n\nClubs in France's top two divisions had shown their support for the LGBTQ+ community by customising their shirts with the rainbow symbol for one matchday in each the last three seasons as part of a league campaign.\n\nLast year, managers wore rainbow armbands and players wore shirts featuring rainbow colours, which were sold at auction to raise funds for anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination charities. In 2022 and 2021, shirts featured rainbow-coloured numbers on the back.\n\nThe campaign has previously been met with some resistance. Last season, Toulouse left some players out of their matchday squad to face Nantes after they disagreed with the club taking part in the anti-homophobia campaign.\n\nIdrissa Gueye missed Paris Saint-Germain's match against Montpellier in May 2022 after players were asked to wear shirts with rainbow numbers, having also missed the equivalent match the previous season.

Camara taped over the badge during his team's 4-0 win over Nantes, and also skipped the pre-match group photo where all players stood before a banner with the same message.\n\nFrench Sports Minister Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra called Camara's actions \"unacceptable\" and called for \"firm sanctions\" against both the player and the club.\n\nMonaco coach Adi H\u00fctter said after the game that the club supports the league's initiative and that Camara's actions were \"a personal choice.\"\n\nThis was the fourth consecutive season that professional clubs in France had been invited to use rainbow-colored numbers, armbands or patches on their shirts to support the LGBTQ movement. Each year, similar controversies arise.\n\nIn 2022, Senegalese-born Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye, then playing for PSG, refused to participate in a game requiring players to wear shirts with rainbow-colored numbers. Senegal's President Macky Sall publicly supported Gueye, stating \"his religious convictions must be respected.\"\n\nLast year, Nantes fined Egyptian striker Mostafa Mohamed for similar reasons. Mohamed again did not play in Sunday's game. Camara also did not play in the equivalent game last season.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Camara_(footballer,_born_January_2000)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Camara (footballer, born January 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Camara", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henri Camara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mali national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_H\u00fctter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adi H\u00fctter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nantes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nantes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Mohamed_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Mohamed (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macky_Sall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macky Sall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrissa_Gueye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idrissa Gueye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Homophobia", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Homophobia", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/547bccb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6247x3514+0+325/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2Fac%2F02e90940e2d9d0fe7a8a118ea887%2F28552b2e09174420b9b0dc073158dcbd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9612863", "eventUri": "eng-9612863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

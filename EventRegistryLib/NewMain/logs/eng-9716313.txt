The diocese operates the hospital.\n\n\"We protest the closure of our hospital in the strongest possible terms,\" Archbishop Hosam Naoum, bishop of the diocese and primate of the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East, said in the statement. \"In a time of warfare and great suffering it is essential that emergency healthcare services are maintained to treat the injured and the dying.\"\n\nThe diocese's statement also said one of its ambulances was fired upon as it was en route to Al Ahli, but no information about the driver and passengers is available.\n\n\"We stand in solidarity with our Anglican family, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, against the closure and evacuation of this vital diocesan health ministry,\" Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said in a July 8 statement released by The Episcopal Church's Office of Public Affairs. \"This action violates the dignity of already-vulnerable people and is against international humanitarian law.\"\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas, which started in October 2023, has resulted in the deaths of an estimated 38,000 Palestinians in Gaza and at least 1,200 Israelis, according to the United Nations. The war has so far displaced almost 2 million Palestinians, or 83% of the population.\n\nThe Holy Land conflict was much discussed at last month's 81st General Convention, held in Louisville, Kentucky. At least 16 resolutions related to the conflict were proposed for bishops' and deputies' consideration.\n\nTwo of the resolutions (D007 and D056) adopted by convention called for an immediate ceasefire, with one additionally calling for humanitarian aid to Gaza and the release of all hostages and prisoners, as well as the condemnation of the increasing seizure of land and violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\n\nIn his statement, Curry reiterated the call for a ceasefire.\n\n\"As a church, we again call for a ceasefire, for humanitarian aid to flow freely to all in need, and we pray for an immediate end to violence against civilian populations,\" he said.\n\nNaoum attended General Convention, where he encouraged Episcopalians and Anglicans to advocate for a just and lasting peace.\n\n\"I don't claim to know or to have the magical solution,\" he said in an interview with Episcopal News Service. But, he added, he hopes his church can begin to help both Israelis and Palestinians take some small steps toward a solution.\n\nEarly on in the conflict, a unit of Al Ahli was partly damaged by rocket fire, thought to have been fired by the Israeli military, and another deadly explosion in the hospital's courtyard drew international condemnation, though Israel and the United States said that blast appeared to have been caused by Palestinian militants. The hospital had also served as a shelter for civilians.\n\nOther Christian leaders also expressed dismay at the hospital's forced closure.\n\n\"The closure of the hospital, the evacuation, and the declaration of the area as a red zone, in addition to the firing upon the ambulance, are all unacceptable violations of humanitarian international law,\" Churches for Middle East Peace, of which The Episcopal Church is a member, said in a July 8 statement. \"International law demands that health establishments and units, including hospitals, should not be attacked. In addition, the already vulnerable, the wounded and the sick, and those seeking shelter should not be placed in further harm or jeopardy.\"\n\nWorld Council of Churches General Secretary the Rev. Jerry Pillay condemned the attacks and also called for an immediate ceasefire.\n\n\"We call on all parties to end the violence immediately and agree to a ceasefire. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this tragic time,\" Pillay said.\n\nThe American Friends of the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, a nonprofit organization and the Diocese of Jerusalem's main fundraising arm, continues to raise funds for the schools and health care institutions of the diocese, including Al Ahli.\n\n\"We appeal to the Israeli forces to permit us to continue our sacred ministry of medical care and healing,\" Naoum said in the Diocese of Jerusalem's statement. \"We plead for an end to the targeting of civilians and all vulnerable people and demand all parties agree to an immediate ceasefire.\"\n\nThe Episcopal Church's Washington, D.C.-based Office of Government Relations is working with contacts in the White House, the U.S. Department of State and key congressional offices in response to Al Ahli's closure, according to the church's Office of Public Affairs.\n\nIn the statement, Curry encourages Episcopalians to join the Episcopal Public Policy Network to receive updates and action alerts and learn how to best advocate to elected officials.\n\n\"Let us pray particularly for the safety of the hospital's patients and staff -- and those who had been sheltering at the hospital who are now displaced again,\" the presiding bishop said. \"And as the prophet Micah said, may God give all of us the will and the courage to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.\"\n\n-Shireen Korkzan is a reporter and assistant editor for Episcopal News Service based in northern Indiana.

There was military activity that took place in the vicinity of the hospital on Sunday.\n\nResponding to the allegation, the IDF told Reuters in a statement that it ordered civilians in certain areas of Gaza City to evacuate so it could reduce potential civilian casualties as it launched new military operations against terrorist groups. The IDF says it told Palestinian health authorities that hospitals could remain in use and there was no need to evacuate.\n\nSpecifically, the IDF told civilians on Sunday to leave the Tuffah, Daraj and Old City neighborhoods of Gaza City as they launched new operations and to go to the shelters located on the western side of the municipality. Al Ahli is situated near Tuffah.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli army sent out an updated announcement, according to The Times of Israel. IDF called on Palestinian civilians in the Sabra, Rimal, Tel al-Hawa and Daraj neighborhoods to evacuate due to the fighting and to head to the designated \"humanitarian zone.\"\n\nMarwan al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital, reported that it received 80 patients and wounded people from Al-Ahli who had to be packed into \"every corner,\" reported the Times.\n\n\"Many cases require urgent surgeries. Many cases suffer from direct shots in the head and require intensive care. Fuel and medical supplies are dwindling,\" al-Sultan said, adding that his hospital received the bodies of 16 people killed in the Israeli incursion, half of whom were women and children.\n\nIsrael began its military offensive in Gaza last October in response to Hamas, a terror group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, launching a surprise attack in southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people. Around 240 were abducted. The Israeli government's stated goal with the offensive is to eradicate Hamas and secure the release of hostages.\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says that over 38,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began but doesn't differentiate between combatants and civilians.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Archbishop Hosam Naoum, primate of the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East, denounced the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest the closure of our hospital in the strongest possible terms,\" said Naoum. \"In a time of warfare and great suffering it is essential that emergency healthcare services are maintained to treat the injured and the dying.\"\n\nOutgoing Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry also denounced the hospital's reported forced closure and evacuation in a statement released by The Episcopal Church's Office of Public Affairs.\n\n\"This action violates the dignity of already-vulnerable people and is against international humanitarian law,\" said Curry. \"Let us pray particularly for the safety of the hospital's patients and staff -- and those who had been sheltering at the hospital who are now displaced again.\"\n\nDuring its 81st General Convention held in Louisville, Kentucky, last month, the Episcopal House of Bishops rejected resolutions that would have labeled Israel an apartheid state and endorsed divestment efforts against Israel but did pass measures calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "virtueonline.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Virtue Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Military activity took place in the vicinity of the hospital on Sunday.\n\nResponding to the allegation, the IDF told Reuters in a statement that it ordered civilians in certain areas of Gaza City to evacuate so it could reduce potential civilian casualties as it launched new military operations against terrorist groups. The IDF says it told Palestinian health authorities that hospitals could remain in use and there was no need to evacuate.\n\nSpecifically, the IDF told civilians on Sunday to leave the Tuffah, Daraj and Old City neighborhoods of Gaza City as they launched new operations and to go to the shelters located on the western side of the municipality. Al Ahli is situated near Tuffah.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli army sent out an updated announcement, according to The Times of Israel. IDF called on Palestinian civilians in the Sabra, Rimal, Tel al-Hawa and Daraj neighborhoods to evacuate due to the fighting and to head to the designated \"humanitarian zone.\"\n\nMarwan al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital, reported that it received 80 patients and wounded people from Al-Ahli who had to be packed into \"every corner,\" reported the Times.\n\n\"Many cases require urgent surgeries.

While expressing sympathy for the victims and the innocent wounded, he hopes and prays that practical pathways can soon be identified to put an end to the ongoing conflicts.\"\n\nIsrael's military operation in Gaza City led on Sunday to the order to close the al-Alhi Arab Hospital and the forced transfer of all patients, after the area was declared a red zone.\n\nThe decision came after a series of nearby drone attacks, the Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem said in a statement. The latter runs the medical facility.\n\n\"In the face of intense Israeli bombardment, this closure puts injured and sick people in even greater danger,\" said Archbishop Welby.\n\n\"I join Archbishop Hosam's appeal to the Israel Defence Forces to allow the hospital to continue its sacred and courageous work of caring for people in desperate need,\" he added.\n\n\"To relieve the immense suffering in the Holy Land, I continue to pray and call for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, and for unfettered aid for the people of Gaza.\"\n\nThe Anglican Diocese of Jerusalem also spoke out against the forced closure, concerned that the sick and injured are in \"great jeopardy\" now that the facility is \"out of operation\" at a time when demand is greatest, while \"injured and sick people have few other options for places to receive urgent medical care.\"\n\n\"In a time of warfare and great suffering it is essential that emergency healthcare services are maintained to treat the injured and the dying,\" said Archbishop Hosam Naoum who joined the protest against the closure.\n\n\"We appeal to the Israeli forces to permit us to continue our sacred ministry of medical care and healing. We plead for an end to the targeting of civilians and all vulnerable people and demand all parties agree to an immediate ceasefire,\" he added.\n\nFounded in 1882, al-Ahli Arab Hospital is located in Gaza City, in the northern sector. The war in Gaza has affected all aspects of life due to restrictions on the movement of materials and people, caused power and food shortages, with water, fuel, and medicines beginning to run out.\n\nThe 80-bed facility is capable of handling about 3,500 outpatient visits a month, according to the website of the Diocese of Jerusalem, which runs the facility and is part of the Anglican Communion.\n\nAccording to the hospital's records, doctors at Al Ahli Arab can handle about 300 operations and 600 radiology cases a month, with a screening programme for early detection of breast cancer for women over 40.\n\nIt offers free clinics for elderly women and mobile clinics providing free medical care and food to people from nearby towns and villages.\n\nThe hospital also sponsored the Gaza's first physician training for Minimally Invasive Surgery. Plans are in development for adding a cancer centre with radiation treatment.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asia News.it"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There was military activity that took place in the vicinity of the hospital on Sunday.\n\nResponding to the allegation, the IDF told Reuters in a statement that it ordered civilians in certain areas of Gaza City to evacuate so it could reduce potential civilian casualties as it launched new military operations against terrorist groups. The IDF says it told Palestinian health authorities that hospitals could remain in use and there was no need to evacuate.\n\nSpecifically, the IDF told civilians on Sunday to leave the Tuffah, Daraj and Old City neighborhoods of Gaza City as they launched new operations and to go to the shelters located on the western side of the municipality. Al Ahli is situated near Tuffah.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli army sent out an updated announcement, according to The Times of Israel. IDF called on Palestinian civilians in the Sabra, Rimal, Tel al-Hawa and Daraj neighborhoods to evacuate due to the fighting and to head to the designated \"humanitarian zone.\"\n\nMarwan al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital, reported that it received 80 patients and wounded people from Al-Ahli who had to be packed into \"every corner,\" reported the Times.\n\n\"Many cases require urgent surgeries. Many cases suffer from direct shots in the head and require intensive care. Fuel and medical supplies are dwindling,\" al-Sultan said, adding that his hospital received the bodies of 16 people killed in the Israeli incursion, half of whom were women and children.\n\nIsrael began its military offensive in Gaza last October in response to Hamas, a terror group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, launching a surprise attack in southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people. Around 240 were abducted. The Israeli government's stated goal with the offensive is to eradicate Hamas and secure the release of hostages.\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry says that over 38,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began but doesn't differentiate between combatants and civilians.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Archbishop Hosam Naoum, primate of the Province of Jerusalem and the Middle East, denounced the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest the closure of our hospital in the strongest possible terms,\" said Naoum. \"In a time of warfare and great suffering it is essential that emergency healthcare services are maintained to treat the injured and the dying.\"\n\nOutgoing Episcopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry also denounced the hospital's reported forced closure and evacuation in a statement released by The Episcopal Church's Office of Public Affairs.\n\n\"This action violates the dignity of already-vulnerable people and is against international humanitarian law,\" said Curry. \"Let us pray particularly for the safety of the hospital's patients and staff -- and those who had been sheltering at the hospital who are now displaced again.\"\n\nDuring its 81st General Convention held in Louisville, Kentucky, last month, the Episcopal House of Bishops rejected resolutions that would have labeled Israel an apartheid state and endorsed divestment efforts against Israel but did pass measures calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Al Ahli Anglican Hospital was compelled to close by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) amidst \"escalating military activity.\" An ambulance was also fired at while en route to the hospital, but there is currently no information about the condition of the driver or the patients.\n\nIn a statement, the Diocese of Jerusalem detailed that on Sunday, drones were firing in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. The area was immediately declared a \"red zone\" and everyone in the hospital was required to evacuate. The Diocese noted that closing the hospital leaves the sick and injured in \"great jeopardy\" at a time when its services are in \"very significant demand.\"\n\nAccording to Anglican Overseas Aid Disaster Response and Resilience Coordinator, Tim Hartley, the hospital had been receiving 300 patients a day despite it being an 80-bed facility. Those injured and sick in Gaza have few alternative places to receive urgent medical care.\n\nThe Al Ahli Hospital was also the subject of controversy surrounding an explosion in October 2023. A munition caused an explosion in the courtyard of the hospital that killed and injured many civilians, and blame was traded between the IDF and Palestinian militants as to whether the explosion was caused by an Israeli attack or a misfired rocket. Although some observers like Human Rights Watch (HRW) believe the explosion was caused by a misfired rocket, HRW has documented other unlawful hospital attacks by Israeli forces.\n\nIn 1970, the UN General Assembly held a session regarding basic principles for the protection of civilian populations in armed conflicts. The Assembly adopted the resolution that \"places or areas designated for the sole protection of civilians, such as hospital zones or similar refuges, should not be the object of military operations.\"\n\nArchbishop Hosam said:\n\nWe appeal to the Israeli forces to permit us to continue our sacred ministry of medical care and healing. We plead for an end to the targeting of civilians and all vulnerable people and demand all parties agree to an immediate ceasefire.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury stood with him, asserting that \"Hospitals must be protected under international humanitarian law.\" He supports the call for a ceasefire and advocates for the release of hostages and the ongoing safety of the people of Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Ahli_SC_(Doha)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Ahli SC (Doha)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anglicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosam_Naoum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hosam Naoum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/10/Buildings_in_Gaza_Strip_being_levelled_by_Israeli_missiles_cropped.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716313", "eventUri": "eng-9716313", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The 59-year-old made the revelation in an interview with the Mail On Sunday, in which he discussed his divorce from his wife, the Countess of Spencer, Karen Gordon, whom he wed in June 2011. \"I just want to devote myself to all my children, and to my grandchildren, and I wish Karen every happiness in the future,\" he said. He added that he is \"immensely sad\" about the divorce, which is a result of the relationship deteriorating amid the emotional strain of writing about the abuse he suffered as a child in his memoir. The Earl released his memoir, A Very Private School, earlier this year in which he detailed the physical and sexual abuse he experienced while at boarding school. In the memoir, he revealed that he was abused by an assistant matron at school when he was a child, during the 1970s.

Many of us left Maidwell with demons sewn into the seams of our souls.\" The Earl later revealed that he had admitted himself for residential treatment for trauma late last year after suffering from the abuse for years. \u201cI\u2019ve bored a lot of therapists for decades and I realised that this school was the root of a lot of the problems I\u2019ve tried to process,\" he said in a previous interview. \"Then I started to meet people who had had terrible things happen as a result of going to that school. Truly awful. \u201cOne bloke said he had been raped three times at the school. He told me how it had destroyed his life and how he had a breakdown when his son reached the age he was when he got raped. He was nine.\u201d Gordon was absent from Althorp, the Spencer's family seat, in March for the book's launch events. The couple met on a blind date in Los Angeles in 2010 and married a year later on the grounds of Althorp, where the Earl's older sister Princess Diana is buried. The couple share one daughter, Lady Charlotte Diana Spencer, whom they welcomed in 2012, and whom they have been raising at Althorp. Karen, the founder of Whole Child charity is also mum to Emma and Kate from a previous marriage with Mark Gordon from 1997 to 2003. Meanwhile, the Earl has seven children and was previously married to Victoria Lockwood and Caroline Freud. Charles is the 9th Earl Spencer, and the maternal uncle of Prince William and Prince Harry. After his divorce, he will reportedly continue living at the Althorp estate, which he manages.", "summary": "Princess Diana\u2019s brother Charles Spencer is divorcing his third wife, Karen Gordon, after releasing his memoir, A Very Private School, in which he detailed the abuse he experienced at school", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/immensely-sad-reason-behind-princess-32992322", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32772824.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Invictus-Games-Foundation-10th-Anniversary-Service.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:43:35", "author": "Martha McHardy,Martha-McHardy", "authors": ["Martha McHardy", "Martha-McHardy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.005}

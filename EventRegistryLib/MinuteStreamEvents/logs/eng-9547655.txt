With the Houston Texans, the debate rages on whether Stefon Diggs, Nico Collins, or even Tank Dell claims this coveted title.\n\nDiggs, known for his electrifying speed, precise route running, and knack for big plays, arrives with a seasoned pedigree, having made his mark as a top-tier receiver with the Buffalo Bills and the Minnesota Vikings. Meanwhile, Collins, a promising young talent, brings size, physicality, and raw athleticism to the forefront, hinting at the potential to become a focal point in the Texans' passing game.\n\nDelving into their respective strengths, weaknesses, and the dynamics of the Texans' offensive system, this article aims to dissect the ongoing debate, shedding light on who truly embodies the role of WR1 for the Houston Texans. Will the incumbent or the young gun be C.J. Stroud's No. 1 target? Let's check it out.\n\nThe comparison between Diggs and Collins intensifies as the Texans navigate a crucial juncture in their roster development. While Diggs brings proven experience and a refined skill set, Collins presents an enticing blend of youth and untapped potential. We have seen this scenario with Diggs; however, in the past, the wideout was known for demanding targets and would get visibly upset when he wasn't receiving the ball. Collins was excellent last season, but even wide receiver Tank Dell will give Collins a run for his money on who will see the most targets outside of Diggs.\n\nThis will be a fascinating wide receiver room to follow throughout the season because it indeed will be a race to 1,000 yards between these three very talented wideouts. Stroud's No. 1 wide receiver will be Diggs due to his extraordinary talent and target demands.\n\nAll three wide receivers will bring excellent fantasy value this season, but early mock drafts have Diggs and Collins as early third-round selections. Without a doubt, you are spending way too much on Collins in this situation, as I'd imagine Diggs will see the most targets on the team.\n\nTank Dell won't be much behind Collins and has the potential to have a better season than him. Diggs' value-approximate draft destination is perfect. Diggs will serve as a low-end WR1 throughout the fantasy season. Collins can be viewed as a low-end WR2, and Dell will be a solid WR3 once he returns from injury.", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_pottinger@rotoballer.com", "name": "Justin Pottinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon_Diggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefon Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mock draft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://cdn.rotoballer.com/2022/08/Nico-Collins-Fantasy-Football-Rankings-Draft-Sleepers-NFL-Injury-News-icon-rotoballer.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547655", "eventUri": "eng-9547655", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

They have to learn a new playbook and scheme, forge bonds with new coaches and teammates both on and off the field, adjust to a new level of competition and region of the country -- an NFL rookie's acclimation period is very much an embodiment of the phrase \"life comes at you fast.\"\n\nColeman, however, faces a task arguably more challenging than that of the median rookie, that may, to the average person, seem insurmountable. The 6-foot-3 pass catcher not only figures to be a primary contributor to (and perhaps the No. 1 option in) a revamped Buffalo Bills passing attack -- he, on paper, is replacing one of the NFL's elite players in the role.\n\nThe Bills traded four-time Pro Bowler Stefon Diggs to the Houston Texans in the 2024 offseason, tying a haphazard bow atop a once amorous tenure that quickly soured. Diggs's on-field contributions in Buffalo are well-documented; he currently sits as the team's fourth-all-time leading receiver, his electric on-field chemistry with quarterback Josh Allen allowing both he and his signal caller to cement themselves as two of the league's premiere players at their respective positions.\n\nAnd making their connection on Sundays that much more endearing to Bills fans was their apparent friendship off it; Diggs and Allen genuinely appeared to be close, even appearing with each other on the cover of an SI Kids magazine issue dubbed \"The BFF Issue.\" It looked like a relationship that was built to last, with Diggs stating on multiple occasions that he desired to retire a Buffalo Bill.\n\nRelated: NFL analytics expert projects record-tying rookie season for Bills WR Keon Coleman\n\nBuffalo fans celebrated this relationship, the commemoration taking various forms like merchandise featuring the two and \"Allen/Diggs\" presidential yard signs. The celebration even manifested in the form of art, particularly as a mural outside of a bar on Buffalo's Hertel Avenue. The piece, originally by local artist Carl Cordes, featured Allen and Diggs standing alongside each other and served as a popular photo op in north Buffalo.\n\nBut nothing great in football lasts forever, with Diggs's stint in Buffalo ultimately falling victim to this sentiment. Reports regarding rifts in the Allen and Diggs relationship surfaced over the past several seasons, with the receiver's consistent cryptic tweets and decision to miss a day of 2023's mandatory minicamp suggesting that he wished to play elsewhere. While it's not believed that he formally requested a trade, the Bills dealt him to the Texans in April.\n\nThe trade left Buffalo with a two-time All-Pro-sized hole in its receiving corps and an outdated mural on its north end. Enter Coleman to fix both of these issues.\n\nThe Bills selected Coleman with the 33rd overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, positioning the former Florida State Seminole, who caught 115 passes for 1,506 yards and 19 touchdowns throughout his three-year collegiate career, as the highest-profile player in a Buffalo receiver room now sans Diggs and Gabriel Davis.\n\nThe 20-year-old made an immediate impression on the Western New York faithful, humorously referencing his affordable Macy's jacket during his introductory press conference before grabbing some Wegmans cookies on his way out of the media room. It's been difficult to maneuver through Buffalo social media throughout the past several days without seeing memes featuring the puffy yellow coat, and it's now been immortalized atop the aforementioned Allen and Diggs mural.\n\nJust as Buffalo hopes Coleman will replace Diggs in its receiving corps, Coleman has replaced Diggs on the Hertel Avenue mural, his now-iconic Macy's jacket replacing the departed Bill's No. 14 uniform.\n\nCordes took to his Instagram to share the update, writing that it's the result of a collaboration with a Buffalo-based company.\n\n\"I have a tendency to hide away [and] create art alone, but this update is a testament to collaboration,\" Cordes wrote. \"This mural began as my umpteenth Allen [and] Diggs drawing [and] Rory [of Zoom Buffalo] transformed it into something . . . clever and resourceful.\"\n\nColeman's impact on the Buffalo faithful is already significant; let's hope he can carry that impact onto the field.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_silagyi@si.com", "name": "Kyle Silagyi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keon_Coleman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keon Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon_Diggs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefon Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Davis_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Davis (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wegmans", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wegmans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seminole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macy's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5861,h_3296,x_0,y_354/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hxamkcx856wp4p0kxz", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547655", "eventUri": "eng-9547655", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

I did it from my sophomore year up until I graduated,\" Diggs said. And, although she doesn't want to \"sound cheesy,\" she \"just really loved that atmosphere. I really liked it. I like taking photos, and obviously, I gravitated toward photography in yearbook (and) I've always loved writing since I was little, since I was a kid.\"\n\nWhen asked what makes a good picture, Diggs -- who is graduating this spring with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism with a minor in fashion from Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication -- had this to say.\n\nThe choice to go study journalism at Arizona State University was almost a no-brainer.\n\n\"It kind of seemed like: I love photography, I love writing; let me do that with journalism and try it,\" said Diggs, who is graduating this spring with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism with a minor in fashion from ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.\n\n\"There's a lot of different avenues that you can take the profession. You can go full writing, you can go full photography, you could do a mix of both. There's literally journalism for anything and everything you could think of, and I like that freedom.\"\n\nStaying close to home was important to the Mesa native, having lived here in Arizona her entire life.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave home for college, and (more importantly) I didn't want to go to GCU or U of A,\" she said, referring to Grand Canyon University and the University of Arizona.\n\nEntering college during the pandemic made for a tough start.\n\n\"I didn't get super involved in college, period,\" she said. \"I started college during COVID (and) I didn't join a lot of clubs; I didn't really socialize on campus. I just never really got super involved with a lot of extracurriculars, or even going to sporting events, games and that type of thing -- big events the university puts on for students.\"\n\nThat changed when she found ASU Student Life, where she became a resident photographer and videographer.\n\n\"I think this has been my longest job -- it's up there,\" she said. \"This job definitely made me experience college more and get out there.\"\n\nDiggs lists last year's Drag U Downtown show as one of her favorite events covered while working with ASU Student Life.\n\n\"It was so fun! Selfishly, I enjoyed it because I love drag, and I've just always admired that art form so much. One of the queens from RuPaul's Drag Race was there at this show. I was having a fangirl moment because it was just so iconic to be in her presence,\" Diggs recalled.\n\nDrag U Downtown was one of the \"hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of events\" Diggs helped covered, and working at Student Life helped her become aware of the sheer number of \"different things that students can get involved with and engage with\" at ASU.\n\n\"I wish I could have this job forever,\" Diggs said. \"I love the work-life balance, the community within ASU Student Life, and like the staff -- everyone here has been super helpful, warm and nice.\"\n\nCoupled with her time at Student Life, Diggs also ventured into the publication industry when she co-founded ENVY Magazine in January 2023.\n\n\"The idea started in January 2022, but the gear started going six months later,\" she said.\n\nENVY was born out of Diggs' desire to champion the voices of writers, directors, designers, artists and other creators in the Valley. She saw the lack of a publication based on Phoenix arts and culture and believed that, through ENVY, she could meet that demand.\n\n\"ENVY was kind of the way for me to try out the kind of journalism I'd be interested in going into,\" she said. \"I've never done something like this before, so I don't really hold it to like super big standards, but if it can just impact a small group of people and keep generating stories and mobilizing different things within the city -- that's all I could really hope for.\"\n\nShe hopes to see her passion project grow to become a self-sufficient and sustaining entity, becoming a household name within the Phoenix media space.\n\n\"I want it to be something that can function without me, you know? I want it to be something bigger than myself. I would love it to be something that can become something Phoenix is known for ... like it would be something Phoenix artists know about, like 'Oh, yeah! It's ENVY. I read an article from them last week,'\" Diggs said.\n\nENVY has grown exponentially since its inception early last year, with a team now of 10 members and, as Diggs puts it, \"seeds\" in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nAsked if she defined herself as a journalist, Diggs replied, \"Do I want to go full-journalism mode, or do I want to go full-photography mode? Because those things intersect in a really interesting way for me. ... Within the last two years, I have started confidently referring to myself as an artist -- almost every photographer is an artist.\"\n\nSo what's next for her?\n\n\"I'm going to relax!\" Diggs exclaimed. \"I want you to put that: I'm going to relax. I'm going to have fun. I'm going to Lollapalooza in August -- hope to see some of you there!\"", "source": {"uri": "news.asu.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "ASU News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yearbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yearbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite_School_of_Journalism_and_Mass_Communication", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Canyon University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Arizona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RuPaul's Drag Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lollapalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547655", "eventUri": "eng-9547655", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

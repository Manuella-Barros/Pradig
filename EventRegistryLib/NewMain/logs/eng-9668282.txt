Mandatory Credit: Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCleveland Browns defensive lineman Lonnie Phelps was arrested following a frightening crash on Wednesday night.\n\nPhelps was taken into custody and cited for suspicion of driving while under the influence after he allegedly crashed his car into the front of a restaurant in Key West, Fla., according to TMZ. Police were called to the scene at around 8:47 p.m. Wednesday over reports that a black Hyundai crashed into the Red Shoe Island Bistro. When officers arrived, witnesses identified Phelps as the driver of the car.\n\nPhelps' girlfriend was also in the car at the time of the accident. Police say both Phelps and the woman were combative when questioned about the incident. Phelps eventually agreed to field sobriety tests, but officers say he complained about how they were administered. The complaining continued as Phelps was transported to the police station.\n\n\"Phelps talked about how thirsty he was, how he did not know what I was going to do to him because females are the worst, asked me not to kill him, asked me how long it takes to bail out, how long I was the detective and informed me I was Russian,\" an officer wrote in the official police report.\n\nPolice say Phelps then refused a breathalyzer at the station and urinated on himself while sitting in a chair. He was booked and cited for DUI and property damage. The 23-year-old is due in court for a hearing next month.\n\nPhelps signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent out of Kansas last year. He was waived just before the start of the season and then signed to a practice-squad deal.

Despite the fact that they dealt with a plethora of injuries to their best players, the Browns persevered and managed to make a run to the postseason. The hope is that, with all their top players back, they will be able to go on an even further run this upcoming campaign.\n\nThings seem to be trending up for the Browns, but the same can't be said for one of their own players in Lonnie Phelps. The second-year defensive lineman ended up getting himself arrested on Wednesday night after he drunkenly crashed his SUV into a restaurant in Florida, immediately throwing his future with the team up in the air.\n\n\"Cleveland Browns defensive end Lonnie Phelps was charged with drunken driving Wednesday night after police said he crashed his SUV into a Florida restaurant. Phelps also faces a charge for damaging property following the incident at the Red Shoe Island Bistro in Key West. Phelps, 23, was taken into custody after refusing to cooperate with officers, according to a Monroe County Sheriff's Office report obtained by Cleveland.com.\" - ESPN\n\nLonnie Phelps finds himself in quite a bit of hot water\n\nPhotos of the crash show that Phelps' car hit the side of the restaurant, and initial estimates of the damage came in at $300,000. Given the fact that he was allegedly drunk behind the wheel, and the damage he caused to the restaurant, it's safe to say that Phelps will find himself in quite a bit of trouble here.\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2023 NFL Draft, Phelps latched on with the Browns and spent the entire campaign on their practice squad before signing a futures contract with him at the end of the season. Now, though, his future with the team is very much up in the air depending on what ends up happening with this legal situation.\n\nPhelps didn't play at all for the Browns last year, but the hope was that he could develop into a contributor on their deep defensive line. He was already facing long odds to make the team's initial 53-man roster, but now he might not even stick around with the team long enough to give himself a chance to make the team.\n\nWhether or not the Browns have Phelps at their disposal is likely going to be inconsequential, but this is a pretty dangerous situation that he caused for other folks. Whether or not he sticks with the team remains to be seen, and Phelps' status, both in the NFL and the legal world, will be worth monitoring over the next few days as more details emerge.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Phelps", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lonnie Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Phelps_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Phelps (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Key West"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Key West"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7529025337.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668282", "eventUri": "eng-9668282", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Phelps refused a breath test & crashed into a Florida restaurant, causing $300k in damage, according to the owner. Phelps had 23.0 sacks in four college seasons with Miami (OH) and Kansas.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Cleveland Browns have released defensive end Lonnie Phelps. He was charged with drunk driving this past Wednesday. The police said that he crashed his vehicle, a 2024 Hyundai SUV, into a Florida restaurant.\n\nRelated NFL Trade Rumors: Cleveland Browns Trade Targets and Candidates\n\nThe Browns find themselves in a tough situation regarding their salary cap and draft capital. By making a couple of trades, they could fix that.\n\nWho is Lonnie Phelps? Phelps was an undrafted free agent signed by the Browns in 2023\n\nIn addition to the drunk driving charge, Phelps is also facing a charge for damaging property following the incident, which took place at the Red Shoe Island Bistro in Key West, Florida. The restaurant was closed at the time of the accident.\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com, Phelps reportedly refused to cooperate with police, including not taking a breathalizer test, and was taken into custody.\n\nThe restaurant's owner, Joseph Schroeder, estimates the damages are about $300,000. He mentioned that if the restaurant were open, the area where the vehicle struck would've injured patrons.\n\nIn the police report, officials mentioned that Phelps was \"agitated\" and turned away from the officers during the interview out of fear of being shot.\n\nI asked Phelps where he was driving from (before the crash), and he said, 'Right in front of it.' I re-asked the question four times in different ways, and Phelps always said, 'Right in front of it.'\n\nBefore being released, Phelps signed a one-year, $795,000 deal in January.\n\nAs mentioned, Phelps was an undrafted free agent from the 2023 draft class. He played college football at Miami (OH) from 2019 to 2021 and transferred to Kansas for the 2022 season.\n\nDuring his college career, he was second-team All-Big 12, second-team All-MAC, and third-team All-MAC.\n\nHe racked up 23.0 sacks, 29.5 tackles for loss, three forced fumbles, and 114 total tackles.

(WFLA) -- A Cleveland Browns player was arrested for driving under the influence after he crashed his vehicle into a restaurant in Key West on Wednesday night, causing significant damage, police said.\n\nShortly before 10 p.m., the Key West Police Department was called to the Red Shoe Island Bistro on 411 Petronia Street after a black Hyundai SUV crashed into the restaurant.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they found Browns' defensive lineman Lonnie Phelps Jr. of Cincinnati leaning against a fence a few feet away.\n\nAccording to an arrest report, police said the 23-year-old was \"very agitated\" and talking about his credit card and seemed confused about whether he had it on him or not.\n\nPolice said Phelps kept throwing his hands in the air and started rushing them to \"do what [they] have to do.\" Without being instructed to do so, he turned around, put his hands behind his back and almost fell over.\n\nBody camera video showed the SUV inside the building with its airbags deployed. When police asked Phelps if he could recall how the crash occurred, he said it happened and asked if he had to pay for anything.\n\nAccording to the report, when asked where he was driving from, Phelps told officers he was \"right in front of it.\" He also asked police what he crashed into.\n\nPolice said Phelps had \"glassy watery blood-shot eyes, droopy eyelids, and a strong odor of alcohol was coming from his breath.\" He was also slurring his words, according to officers.\n\nAn officer said Phelps and his girlfriend, who was in the car with him, refused to talk to authorities. Phelps also reportedly told police he \"did not want to get shot.\"\n\nWhile performing DUI exercises, police said Phelps \"continued to talk in a loud and erratic manner with his hands up,\" and made statements like \"I have never been here before, just do it,\" and \"just put the tape down so I can walk the line like a concussion test.\"\n\nPhelps was taken to the Monroe County Detention Center for DUI and damaged property. According to jail records, Phelps is due for arraignment on July 2.\n\nRed Shoe Island Bistro posted a video of the damage. The post said the restaurant was closed when the incident occurred.\n\n\"We are truly thankful that no one was hurt.

According to TMZ, Phelps was arrested on a DUI charge by Key West police last night after crashing his SUV into the side of a restaurant.\n\n\"Cops say they were dispatched to the scene in reference to a traffic crash ... and when they arrived, they saw a black Hyundai wedged into the side of the eatery. When officers asked bystanders who was inside the vehicle at the time of the wreck, Phelps and his girlfriend were ID'ed, police said.\"\n\nThe incident occurred shortly after 8:45 PM/EST, according to the police report via TMZ. Phelps' car hit the side of the Red Shoe Island Bistro. The restaurant remains closed and shared this video last night detailing the extensive damage. Thankfully, no one was injured and the Bistro vows to open \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nTMZ's reporting goes on to detail Phelps' confusion about the situation. Per TMZ, Phelps told an arresting officer that he \"was Russian.\" The report also alleges Phelps was not cooperative with police, refused a breathalyzer, and peed on himself at the police station.\n\nIn addition to DUI, he was also charged with property damage. A hearing is set for July.\n\nUndrafted in 2023, Phelps has yet to appear in an NFL game. He spent his rookie year on the practice squad and was signed to a Reserve/Future contract in January. Beginning his college career at Miami (Ohio), he transferred to Kansas for 2022, racking up 11.5 TFL and seven sacks.\n\nHe is one of several NFL players to be arrested this offseason, including CB Cam Sutton, DL Isaiah Buggs, and WR Rashee Rice.\n\nThe Browns will have to decide whether they want to keep Phelps on their roster heading into training camp. He was competing for a backup/special teams role on the team's 53-man roster.\n\nRelated Items:Cleveland Browns, Lonnie Phelps, TMZ Recommended for you Deshaun Watson Making 'Heat-Seeking' Throws During Spring Practices Report: Amari Cooper, Browns At Contract Impasse, Cleveland Unwilling To Extend Beyond One Year Deshaun Watson: 'I Must Be Pretty Damn Good' If People Are Debating About Me", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonnie_Phelps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lonnie Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_West", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Key West"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Key West"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathalyzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breathalyzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Buggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Buggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_RedHawks_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami RedHawks football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amari_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amari Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Homophobia", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Homophobia", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/StockLonniePhelps1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668282", "eventUri": "eng-9668282", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Are you kidding me?\" Phelps said. \"It's the biggest venue we've ever had in the sport.\"\n\nPhelps told McAfee about his excitement to watch the fresh new faces and the \"studs coming up in this sport\" along with veterans vying for their third or fourth Olympic teams.\n\n\"This is probably more intense than the actual Olympics,\" Phelps said. \"To be able to compete in the trials where you have 2,000-2,500 swimmers... You're competing for 52 spots! It's pretty intense, bro.\"\n\nThe swim trials continue at Lucas Oil Stadium until June 23. Get in on the excitement by grabbing your tickets here.", "source": {"uri": "fox59.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox 59"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_christy@fox59.com", "name": "Matt Christy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Oil_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Oil Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2016/08/gettyimages-588138426.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668282", "eventUri": "eng-9668282", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 1421, "textEnd": 1428}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

According to the docs, when the cops attempted to question the NFL star and his girl, neither cooperated, causing more of a disturbance.\n\nDespite the Cleveland Browns player consistently talking over police and interrupting them, they eventually identified Phelps as the driver of the car, with his girlfriend in the passenger seat. He was also showing signs that he was intoxicated throughout the line of questioning.\n\nThe 23-year-old finally agreed to take a sobriety test, but he caused more problems as the docs claim he wasn't happy with how they were administered.\n\nPhelps was ultimately arrested and placed in the back of the police car.\n\nPolice had their hands full with Lonnie Phelps as they say the 23-year-old NFL star did nothing but complain the entire car ride to the police station.\n\n\"Phelps talked about how thirsty he was,\" one officer wrote in the report, per TMZ. \"How he did not know what I was going to do to him because females are the worst, asked me not to kill him, asked me how long it takes to bail out, how long I was the detective and informed me I was Russian.\"\n\nBut it didn't end there because once they arrived at the station, the 23-year-old continued to give the police a hard time. Not only did he refuse to take a breathalyzer, but he also urinated on himself while sitting on a chair.\n\nIn the end, the Cleveland Browns defensive lineman was charged with a DUI and property damage. He's due in court for a hearing next month.\n\nLonnie Phelps's arrest comes just days after Kansas City Chiefs player Isaiah Buggs was arrested after he allegedly dragged the mother of his child down a flight of stairs.\n\nAs The Blast previously reported, Isaiah Buggs, 27, was arrested on Sunday and was charged with second-degree domestic violence/burglary. The victim informed police that the NFL star broke into her Tuscaloosa, Alabama, residence with a tire iron around 5:28 a.m. He then went upstairs to confront her, allegedly dragging her down the stairs before being arrested.\n\nHe was on a 24-hour domestic violence hold with a bond set at $5,000 and was released early Monday.\n\nBoth of these arrests come months after Raiders defensive end Janarius Robinson was arrested for suspicion of DUI after he allegedly hit a woman with his car.\n\nAccording to Bleacher Report, officers were called to the Aria Resort & Casino after a call came in of a woman who was hit by a car and then \"became pinned between two cars.\"\n\nWhen officers arrived at the scene and spoke to Robinson, they said, \"his speech was mumbled and his body was slightly swaying side to side\" despite telling police that he had two drinks starting at 10 p.m. and stopped drinking at 11 p.m., nearly seven hours before the accident occurred at 5:45 a.m.\n\nHe was ultimately released on his own recognizance.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_coffey_behrens@theblast.com", "name": "Kelly

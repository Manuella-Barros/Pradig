Halfway through this game, it appeared that Oilers superstar Leon Draisaitl may have been injured. He missed the latter half of the second period and looked to be fighting something during the 3rd period.\n\nWhen it comes to this playoff series I don't think there were many people who picked the Oilers to sweep 4 straight against the Vancouver Canucks. In order to win in 5 or 6 games the Oilers will need to lose at least one game, hopefully, the Oilers can turn this series around. One thing that will hurt the Oilers chances is if Draisaitl is hurt.\n\nIf we go back a couple of years ago, Draisaitl was playing on a sprained ankle and while he still was able to contribute he was not 100% and that changes the look of this team. If Draisaitl isn't playing 100% he can not drive his own line and the Oilers may be forced to change the lines. This would affect every line for the Oilers.\n\nIf Draisaitl needs to play on a line where he isn't the main driver they move him on the McDavid's wing, just like they did when he had his sprained ankle. I would get the first line would then consist of McDavid- Draisaitl- Hyman which would make the second line a lot weaker. My best guess would be Kane- Nuge- Holloway. I know it will be Kane and Nugent-Hopkins, but I am guessing they might give Holloway a look in that spot.\n\nI highly doubt that we will hear anything about what is actually going on with Draisaitl, but from the looks of the broadcast, it was some sort of issue with his lower back. From an Edmonton Oilers point of view, I really hope that this injury is something minor because if the Oilers want to hoist the Cup Draisaitl is going to be a major part of that.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Nugent-Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Nugent-Hopkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_107/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/156/01hxdx2wy0ten7jxtger.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552221", "eventUri": "eng-9552221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

It wasn't clear what kind of injury he might have suffered and broadcast analysts tried to figure out where and when he might have suffered something that would have kept a genuinely tough player out of action. It turns out, according to the Oilers coach, that it was cramping and equipment issues.\n\nRelated: Canucks Perform Epic Game 1 Comeback vs. Oilers, Win 5-4\n\nDraisaitl returned for the third period and while he didn't quite look the same and wasn't as sharp -- most Oilers weren't in the comeback win by Vancouver -- he labored slightly but didn't look injured. Draisaitl didn't speak with the media after the loss. He was being worked on by trainers and medical staff. But, in a postgame interview, Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch confirmed it was cramping issues.\n\nIt is not expected to be a long-term issue or concern added Knoblauch. At the same time, there's going to be worry among the Oilers' fan base. Having a less-than-healthy Draisaitl is a massive problem for the Oilers who now find themselves down a game after seemingly having Game 1 in hand.\n\nThe timing of Draisaitl's leaving was in line with the timing of Vancouver's push. Down 4-2 heading into the third period, the Canucks pressed hard and scored three unanswered goals to take the lead. More upsetting for Edmonton was the fact they didn't have a shot on goal until the 14-minute mark of that period and Connor McDavid was held shotless for the first time in his playoff career.\n\nEdmonton didn't play well in the latter half of the game, but concern over Draisaitl seemed to deflate the team instead of motivating them to pick up their pace after one of their top guys looked like he might be out.\n\nThe expectation is that Draisaitl will play in Game 2, but this will be a situation worth keeping an eye on.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Leon-Draisaitl-Oilers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552221", "eventUri": "eng-9552221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

But it's the playoffs, so we won't know if the Edmonton Oilers center was really suffering from back spasms or bruised ribs, as some internet doctors suggested on Twitter, or if he truly was the victim of a wardrobe malfunction, as his coach insisted.\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said of the concern regarding Draisaitl's status. \"Just some cramping. Between cramping and some equipment issues, that's why his ice time went down.\"\n\nEither way, Draisaitl's absence was part of the reason why the Oilers managed to blow a 4-1 lead in the third period to the Vancouver Canucks in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinal on Wednesday.\n\nDraisaitl's last shift in the second period came around the 12-minute mark when he briefly stepped on the ice and skated a bit before leaving for the dressing room. He returned in the third period.\n\nBut with Draisaitl gone and then not looking like himself, Vancouver erased a three-goal deficit and won.\n\n\"If he's showing that outward pain, then he's hurt, because he doesn't like to come off that way at all,\" said Sportsnet analyst and former Oilers winger Luke Gazdic.\n\nIndeed, it's likely going to take more than a cramp to keep Draisaitl out of the series. Two years ago, he suffered a high-ankle sprain in the first-round series against Los Angeles and finished the playoffs with 24 points in the following 10 games.\n\nIn the first round, Draisaitl took a nasty spill after coming into contact with Kings forward Pierre-Luc Dubois, which some are also speculating could be affecting Draisaitl.\n\nWhatever the reason, the fact that he might not be 100 percent is not a good sign for an Oilers team with all the tools for a deep run.\n\nWhile Hart Trophy finalist Connor McDavid leads the playoffs with 13 points and Rocket Richard Trophy finalist Zach leads the playoffs with nine goals, Draisaitl is a significant factor of the team's offense.\n\nDraisaitl, who somewhat quietly scored 41 goals and 106 points this season, is tied for second in playoff scoring with 12 points. That includes a pair of assists in Game 1 against the Canucks, despite logging just 16 minutes and 43 seconds of ice time.\n\n\"Obviously, lots going on on the bench,\" McDavid said. \"But Leo's fine.\"\n\nDraisaitl better be fine because with the Canucks holding McDavid to no shots in Game 1, the Oilers will need all the help they can get in Game 2.\n\nRelated: Oilers vs. Canucks: Three Key Matchups That Will Determine Who Moves On\n\nRelated: NHL Playoff Predictions: Which Western Teams Will Win Their Tight Second-Round Series?", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_traikos@theolympian.com", "name": "Michael Traikos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cramp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Back pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Knoblauch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kris Knoblauch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Gazdic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Gazdic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_\"Rocket\"_Richard_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hart Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Luc_Dubois", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Luc Dubois"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.theolympian.com/wps/build/images/theolympian/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552221", "eventUri": "eng-9552221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Friedman noted that there was some mystery and concern surrounding it.\n\nLeon Draisaitl didn't play the final eight minutes of the second period and went back to the locker room. Even when he attempted to get back to the ice, he didn't last more than 10 seconds and had to come off immediately.\n\nIn the post-game interview, Oilers HC Kris Knoblauch disclosed Leon Draisaitl was suffering from crampies issues and hence left the bench late in the 2nd period.\n\nDuring the second period intermission on Sportsnet's broadcast, Friedman indicated that there was an issue that prevented Draisaitl from playing effectively, leading to his short ice time in the second period.\n\n\"There is mystery and some concern\", Friedman said. \"Leon Draisaitl did not play the last eight minutes of the second period went back to the room.\n\n\"Then he does try to go one more time. Greg showed it to you during the period. He didn't lasted 10 seconds and then had to come right off the ice.\"\n\nThere was, notably, a specific moment that could have led to Draisaitl leaving the ice. In the second period, the Oilers forward experienced a push from Tyler Myers on the back, which appeared to be completely unintentional.\n\nThe incident near the boards might have played a role in Draisaitl's departure from the ice during the game.\n\nHowever, the Edmonton Oilers were relieved of any injury scare, as Leon Draisaitl returned to the ice in the third period to complete the game.\n\nRyan Whitney speculates reason behind Leon Draisaitl's absence\n\nNHL analyst Ryan Whitney shared his concerns about Draisaitl's absence on X/Twitter. He speculated that the issue might be related to Leon Draisaitl's lower back or a rib, as it didn't appear to be a lower-body injury.\n\n\"Maybe lower back or a rib or something? Didn't seem be anything lower body. Please let this man be ok. On the bright side we've seen him dominate a playoff series with a sprained ankle in the past,\" Whitney wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, it was a disappointing loss for the Edmonton Oilers in Game 1 against the Vancouver Canucks. The Oilers had a dominant game but squandered a 4-2 lead in the third period.\n\nThe Canucks put on an impressive display, scoring three goals in the final period to secure a 5-4 win in the first game of the Round 1 series at the Rogers Arena.

In the early Edmonton Oilers playoff games, the increase in physical play makes it more difficult for teams to impose their will on opponents.\n\nThe game is called differently in the postseason, and intimidation rules the day.\n\nLeon Draisaitl's game doesn't change. The big man is fearless, seemingly impervious and absolutely willing to give as much as he takes from the other team.\n\nFans and media are often guilty of hyperbole when describing the exploits of their favourite players.\n\nYou might hear someone say a player improves offensively during the postseason, when the games get more important.\n\nIt's rarely true and ignores that scoring at the same rate in the postseason represents a true accomplishment.\n\nOne of the most famous \"big game\" players in history was Mark Messier.\n\nDuring his 12 seasons with Edmonton, he posted 1.22 points per game in the regular season and 1.30 points per game in the playoffs.\n\nConnor McDavid (1.52 points per game in the regular season, 1.61 points per game in the playoffs) is historically in the range with Messier, Glenn Anderson and most of the star players in history who have played enough postseason games for the samples to land correctly.\n\nThe scoring numbers are ridiculous in both the regular season and the postseason.\n\nExceeding established levels of ability during the playoffs is rare for impact players.\n\nSo, that makes Draisaitl unique.\n\nIn the first 10 seasons of his career, Draisaitl is averaging 1.18 points per game in the regular season and 1.61 points per game in the postseason.\n\nIs he really a \"big game\" player, more than most top-flight NHL players in the game's history?\n\nWe're 10 years in. Call it what you want, Draisaitl is an outlier.\n\nPerhaps it's his fearless playing style, although Messier was the king in that regard. Perhaps it's the time with McDavid on the club's monster power play.\n\nNo matter. It's real.\n\nThe regular season is long and attention spans don't allow for the same degree of intense evaluation of each game.\n\nAs the season reaches the midway point, we may observe the games but lose sight of subtle accomplishments.\n\nWe know the win-loss record, the boxcars (goals, assists, points), some may even know five-on-five goal share, but overall the regular season is a more casual observance compared to the postseason.\n\nOnce the playoffs hit, everything is vital. Faceoffs in the defensive end, expert passes, booming shots, multiple-point games, even body language is elevated in importance.\n\nDraisaitl is good to great at pretty much all of these things.\n\nHis regular season totals and playoff numbers show a complete player and an impact big man offensively.\n\nThere are interesting wrinkles. Sample size, usage and opposition strategies shine through when we compare Draisaitl's regular season numbers with the playoff totals.\n\nDraisaitl's goals per 60 are low so far, it's reasonable to expect a spike over the length of a long playoff series. Regression never shows up on time, but elite talent usually hurries recovery. His shots per 60 will increase.\n\nThe big man has reduced his penalties taken (different rulebook) and is drawing many more (counter to rulebook) compared to his regular season. That speaks to discipline, especially considering the increased number of hits he is taking this spring.\n\nOne area of his game that is obvious from the eye test: Draisaitl has cut down on his giveaways in a big way.\n\nThat kind of control, combined with effort on the backcheck (takeaways) are obvious in any part of the season, but especially visible in the playoffs.\n\nQuoting colleagues Thomas Drance and Harman Dayal at The Athletic, \"It's not just the points, although they were massive, or the clutch moments throughout the series. It's also the physical play, the 20 minutes a night Miller logged, the way his line dominates the run of play at five-on-five, and the 58 percent faceoff win rate he managed against Nashville.\"\n\nA big part of what makes Draisaitl both valuable and distinct in the postseason is that he can't be dominated physically and is capable of punishing opponents while also being dangerous with the puck on his stick.\n\nIf Miller's line holds sway against a McDavid unit sans Draisaitl, and it might, expect the coach to either load up the top unit with 97-29, or run Draisaitl's line head-to-head in an effort to get quality minutes for the captain.\n\nDraisaitl has always had frightening comparables. In 2021 I looked at Messier, Jean Beliveau and Frank Mahovlich's scoring rates through the same point in each career and the big man was in the conversation.\n\nIs Draisaitl a playoff unicorn?\n\nBig centres who can impact the game across 200 feet and can run over opponents are extremely valuable.\n\nDraisaitl is in his prime, and just finished a series going head-to-head with Anze Kopitar, the king of the Pacific Division centres for more than a decade.\n\nMatching up against Miller will happen, but we don't know how often.\n\nWe know Draisaitl will be involved in all areas, from scoring and making cherry passes to winning late-game faceoffs that matter.\n\nThere's also the matter of his unusual spike in offensive numbers during postseason games.\n\nSidney Crosby's first 10 seasons in the NHL saw him score 1.36 points per game in the regular season and 1.11 in the playoffs.\n\nGordie Howe was at 1.03 points per game in the regular season and 1.03 in the playoffs in his first 10 seasons as a regular.\n\nIs Draisaitl a unicorn?

The stress from the potential injury to star forward Leon Draisaitl has been swiftly alleviated, as Coach Kris Knoblauch assured media members that it was merely cramping and some equipment issues, not a serious injury that kept Draisaitl off the ice for a lot of the second period.\n\nIn the crucible of the second round of the playoffs, every little thing carries monumental weight. The Oilers started the game with an electrifying performance that built a commanding 4-1 lead but were suddenly confronted with Draisaitl's absence from their bench. The Oilers are heavily reliant on his offensive prowess and commanding presence on the ice, the fact that he was off the ice may have been enough to throw this team off their game.\n\nAs the game unfolded, the Oilers looked worse and worse, ending in a heart-wrenching defeat that left fans reeling. However, amidst the wreckage of their disastrous second half, a glimmer of hope emerged. The reassurance from Coach Knoblauch served as some good news moving forward, shutting down most of Oilers fan concerns.\n\nFor Oilers fans, who have endured the highs and lows of playoff hockey with unwavering loyalty, this news comes as something positive to follow that game. The thought of having to try and win the Stanley Cup without a healthy Draisaitl seemed nearly impossible. Yet, with the confirmation that Draisaitl's injury is not as dire as initially feared, a sense of optimism rolls throughout Oil Country.\n\nIn the intense arena of postseason hockey, resilience reigns supreme. The Oilers have consistently demonstrated their capacity to overcome obstacles, being pumped up by the news of one of their top scorer's impending return. With this reassurance, they can focus their determination on the upcoming challenges.\n\nAs they gather themselves for the battles ahead, the Edmonton Oilers and their loyal fans can take a brief sigh of relief.

Vancouver now holds a 1-0 series lead heading into Game 2 tomorrow night.\n\nDraisaitl, who left last night's game in the second period but returned to play in the third period, was not on the ice with the rest of the team. Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch told reporters after the game that his absence was due to cramping and equipment issues and didn't appear to be serious.\n\nIn his absence, Knoblauch ran some new-look lines at practice, with Warren Foegele moving up to the top line next to Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman, while Mattias Janmark was bumped back down to the fourth line with Derek Ryan and Connor Brown.\n\n630 CHED's Bob Stauffer reported the new-look lines from Vancouver.\n\nThe fact that Sam Gagner was acting as the second-line centre during line rushes seems to be an encouraging sign that Draisaitl could play tomorrow.

Positives after a playoff loss are hard to come by, but they do exist.\n\nHere are a few of them to help you get back into a positive mood.\n\nOilers' special teams keep dominating\n\nIf there was one positive aspect of the Oilers' game last night, it was their play on the power play and penalty kill.\n\nEdmonton opened the scoring early in the first period with Zach Hyman continuing his scoring ways and potting a PP goal on the team's only man-advantage chance of the night. The Oilers now have 10 PP goals throughout the playoffs, and they will most likely get more than one opportunity in Game 2 to add to that total.\n\nThe team's perfect penalty kill also kept up last night as they killed off all three Canucks powerplays to improve to a sparkling 15/15 while down a man. Edmonton is the only team left in the postseason with a perfect PK.\n\nWinning the special teams battle will be important in this series, and it looks like the Oilers have the early edge.\n\nSilovs looks beatable\n\nGoaltending was not on Edmonton's side in the third period, with Stuart Skinner giving up a few ugly goals, but Arturs Silovs didn't look much better at the other end of the ice.\n\nThe rookie Canucks goaltender got torched for two goals in the first period and then let in two more very soft goals in the second period off the sticks of Cody Ceci and Zach Hyman. Those goals were two of the eight shots he faced in the final 40 minutes of the game.\n\nEdmonton didn't test him a whole lot but still found a way to sneak four goals past Silovs. That should be something that they take away from Game 1 and something they should make a point of doing more often. It doesn't appear that Silovs will be the reason the Oilers can't score in this series, so make a concerted effort to get as many good looks on the net as they can.\n\nSkinner's performance in Game 1 was all over the map, but the sophomore goaltender has shown an ability to bounce back from these types of games.\n\nOilers have been here before\n\nLosing Game 1 of a series is never the preferred option, and younger teams are likely to get more in their head about dropping a game like this, but the Oilers have been here before.\n\nThe team has lost each of its last two Game 1s of the second round to the Calgary Flames and Vegas Golden Knights. The Flames' loss was an embarrassing 9-6 drubbing that spurred the Oilers to four straight victories. The Oilers' loss to Vegas was a 6-4 score, and they very nearly won that series before losing in six games.\n\nIn both of those games, the Oilers were vastly outplayed and lost by larger margins than they did last night. Edmonton didn't play well at all last night, but they almost won despite that.\n\nKnowing how the team has responded in the past, there is a good chance they play a whole lot better than how they did last night.\n\nPlayoff hockey is stressful, and losing a game can sometimes feel like the end of the world for fans. Rest assured, a seven-game series is not decided by the team that draws first blood. It's a battle that can see momentum shift at the drop of a puck.\n\nThe Oilers will look to get their first jab in when Game 2 goes tomorrow night.", "source": {"uri": "dailyhive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailyhive.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preston_hodgkinson@dailyhive.com", "name": "Preston Hodgkinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Ceci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Ceci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.dailyhive.com/20240508212458/Oilers-Hyman-1-500x258.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552221", "eventUri": "eng-9552221", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Ethan CairnsVANCOUVER - Edmonton Oilers star Leon Draisaitl is \"day-to-day\" with an undisclosed injury, says head coach Kris Knoblauch. Knoblauch says the Oilers coaching staff will decide Friday morning whether the 28-year-old German forward plays that evening in Game 2 of Edmonton's series with the Vancouver Canucks. Draisaitl missed practice Thursday and appeared to be labouring late in Edmonton's loss to Vancouver in Game 1 of their second-round series Wednesday. He had two assists in the game but was limited to 16:43 seconds of ice time, well below the 20:41 he averaged per game in the regular season. Knoblauch said after the game that Draisaitl was dealing with \"cramping and equipment issues\" that kept him off the ice. Draisaitl has points in each of Edmonton's six playoff games this year, with five goals and seven assists across the stretch. Oilers forward Adam Henrique practised with the team Thursday after missing Game 1 with an ankle injury. Knoblauch says Henrique is also listed as \"day-to-day\" and a decision will be made Friday on whether he plays in Game 2.

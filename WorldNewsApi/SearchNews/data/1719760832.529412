I investigated so you don\u2019t have to", "text": "Daniel Daggers is the head honcho in Buying London (Picture: Netflix/PA Wire) Buying London had grander designs than some of the multi-million-pound properties featured on Netflix\u2019s latest stab at turning estate agents into stars. Billed as the UK\u2019s answer to Selling Sunset \u2013 the runaway lockdown smash hit that followed identikit Blondes flogging Beverley Hills mansions to sports stars and billionaires \u2013 the streamer was clearly hoping for an easy win. But that aspiration came crashing down, seemingly, with just one terrible review. In a very rare move, The Guardian gave the show 0 out of 5 stars and branded Buying London \u2018probably the most hateable TV show ever made.\u2019 Can it really be that bad, though? To spare yourself the seven-odd hours of your precious time, I\u2019ve watched it for you. Here\u2019s my honest verdict. Buying London has closely followed the Selling Sunset formula. There\u2019s a middle-aged man in this case, Daniel Daggers, who runs estate agents DDRE Global and seems perpetually surprised to be on camera. His employees are (almost) exclusively impossible attractive women who, in between viewings, pick fights with each other over petty drama that\u2019s barely worth splitting a fingernail over. Buying London was branded the most \u2018hateable\u2019 show on TV (Picture: Netflix/PA Wire) South African estate agent Lauren is the Queen Bee in Buying London (Picture: Netflix / Buying London) Buying London has rubbed critics and viewers up the wrong way (Picture: Netflix) Then there is the property. In this case, Buying London predominately features homes in those posh parts of west London typically frequented by oligarchs and the odd stray tourist and, um, Hertfordshire. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovely, but it\u2019s not Venice Beach. This is where the similarities between Selling Sunset and Buying London end. Buying London has all the ingredients but they\u2019re all a little off \u2013 like eating fish and chips anywhere other than the coast. There was a delicious campness to the cast of Selling Sunset including the best reality TV villain/queen in the shape of Christine Quinn. It was darkly humourous to watch the other women crumble in her presence. In Buying London, however, the estate agents are just too Made in Chelsea and the \u2018drama\u2019 between them too contrived. From what I could gather, the main upset was when Queen Bee Lauren spoke over fellow agent Rasa at a viewing. Yes, that is annoying, but does that really merit a four-episode arc? Rasa locks horn with Lauren in one of the series\u2019 main storylines (Picture: Netflix / Buying London) To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next Also \u2013 and this is a criticism levelled at Selling Sunset, too \u2013 it\u2019s reductive having a show centred around contrived arguments between women. Why not focus on how they\u2019ve smashed the glass ceiling and have impressive jobs in a male-dominated industry? It\u2019s more thrilling watching them secure impressive sales after an intense negotiation than side-eyeing each other from across the office. So what about the homes? Much has been (rightly) said of Netflix deciding to spotlight a show about mansions with multi-million-pound price tags in a city collapsing due to a housing crisis. It does feel icky watching billionaires cavorting around luxury homes without a care in the world when many can\u2019t afford rent. Plus \u2013 and I\u2019m going to say it \u2013 the houses are not even that nice. The best homes look like showrooms for soulless 5-star hotels, while the worst look like they were last given a facelift by a gauche Count in the 70s. The show follows a cast of estate agents seemingly plucked from Made in Chelsea (Picture: Zoe McConnell) The drama in Buying London is somewhat contrived (Picture: Netflix) Perhaps, though, the crumbling interiors of these \u2018super prime\u2019 homes serve as another bleak statement about wealth inequality in the UK. Daniel even said himself a \u00a315million pound home featured in Buying London needed \u2018modernisation.\u2019 What hope, then, do the rest of us have? But despite irrepressible feelings of despair, I could not stop watching Buying London. There was something oddly soothing about tuning into the televisual equivalent of a Dulux gloss paint. Easy on the eye, but not quite Farrow & Ball. Or, I could just be so tired of the depressing state of the world that I\u2019m just numb to everything now. Should you give it a watch? Look, if you\u2019re hungover, tired after work, or want some background noise \u2013 sure. But if you have an ounce of rage about modern society \u2013 stay well clear.

On Thursday, President Joe Biden called on both sides to return to the negotiating table.\n\nThe company locked out about 125 workers represented by a chapter of the International Association of Firefighters union Saturday after failing to reach an agreement on a new contract, said Casey Yeager, president of the union chapter, I-66. The previous contract expired March 1, but the firefighters, who work at Boeing's plants in the Seattle area, continued to work under its provisions.\n\nThe talks, conducted with the help of a federal mediator, stalled after the firefighters rejected what the company had said was its final offer. The two sides met as recently as the night of May 3, minutes before the lockout began, Yeager said.\n\n\"When we left our negotiating room the other day, we had a very firm discussion that we were willing to continue to bargain,\" he said. \"They can call us at any point, and we will bargain, but at this time they have not sent any information to us at all.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Biden expressed support for the firefighters, saying he was \"concerned\" that Boeing had locked them out. \"Collective bargaining is a right that helps employers and employees,\" he said on the social media platform X, adding, \"I encourage folks to return to the table to secure a deal that benefits Boeing and gets these firefighters the pay and benefits they deserve.\"\n\nBiden is expected to visit the Seattle area Friday for campaign events.\n\nBoeing, a big supplier to the military and NASA in addition to making jets for airlines, said it still hoped to reach a deal with the union but did not respond directly to Biden.\n\n\"We remain committed to securing an agreement,\" Boeing said in a statement. \"Our offer provides significant pay increases and increased benefits. The union should allow our employees to vote our offer, which was presented before the lockout.\"\n\nUnder the rejected offer, the firefighters would have to work 19 years before reaching the company's highest pay scale, up from 14 years in the current contract, Yeager said. Fire departments in the area offer higher starting salaries and allow firefighters to climb to top pay in three to five years, he said.\n\nBoeing's firefighters earned an average of $91,000 last year, according to the company, which said its contract offer would raise that figure to $112,000 in the first year. Boeing also said its compensation was competitive with other industrial fire departments.\n\nBoeing's firefighters respond to accidents and medical emergencies at the company's Seattle-area factories, where they are expected to respond quickly to prevent the spread of fires and possibly toxic emissions, coordinating with municipal firefighters. They also provide support during aircraft refueling and when planes take off and land, Yeager said.\n\nThe company said the firefighters working in place of those who were locked out had successfully responded to all calls that had come in.\n\nThe firefighters have been picketing at Boeing's facilities this week, joined by other firefighters and supporters.\n\nThe dispute is unfolding as Boeing and its largest union, which represents more than 30,000 employees, engage in contract talks.

The previous contract expired on March 1, but the firefighters, who work at Boeing's plants in the Seattle area, continued to work under its provisions.\n\nThe talks, conducted with the help of a federal mediator, stalled after the firefighters rejected what the company had said was its final offer.

The union, the International Association of Fire Fighters, accused the company of \"choosing corporate greed over safety.\"\n\nBiden stepped into the feud with a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Thursday afternoon:\n\nA lockout is a work stoppage initiated by the employer rather than the workers, with the aim of gaining leverage in contract talks.\n\nThe firefighters' previous agreement with Boeing recently expired, and the two sides failed to come to terms on a new one. Boeing maintains that it made two competitive offers to the union, but the IAFF said the proposals would leave firefighters with pay and benefits well behind local municipal fire departments.\n\nThe union accused Boeing of using the lockout to \"punish, intimidate, and coerce its firefighters into accepting a contract that undervalues their work.\"\n\nIt's been a tough year so far for Boeing. The company hasn't managed to escape the news ever since a door panel blew out on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet in January, prompting Congressional hearings on Boeing's safety practices and an audit by the Federal Aviation Administration. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun recently announced he would resign at the end of the year.\n\nThe company did not immediately comment on Biden's statement Thursday. The company said over the weekend that it had \"fully implemented our contingency plan\" to operate with replacement firefighters and \"ensure safe operations\" during the lockout.\n\nBiden has shown a far greater willingness than his predecessors to wade into union matters at individual companies.\n\nEarlier this year he voiced his support for Volkswagen workers who were trying to unionize their Tennessee factory, and publicly congratulated them when they won their election last month. In 2021, he gave a speech denouncing union-busting in the context of a closely watched election at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama. He often touts himself as \"the most pro-union\" president in history.\n\nBiden's relationship with the firefighters' union goes back years. The IAFF was the first major union to endorse Biden during his 2020 run for the White House, and the president spoke at the union's conference in Washington last year.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_jamieson@yahoo.com", "name": "Dave Jamieson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockout_(industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lockout (industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Fire_Fighters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Association of Fire Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_busting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union busting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Occupations", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Occupations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/223293fe4f5c3c05c9ee13a31da8dc5f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555126", "eventUri": "eng-9555126", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

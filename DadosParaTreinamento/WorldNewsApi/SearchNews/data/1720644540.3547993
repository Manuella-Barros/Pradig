Grisha, 12, and Vika Krepp, 10, clung on to their pet beagle dogs for warmth after they went missing during a fishing trip in Slobodo-Turinsky district in Russia\u2019s Sverdlovsk region. Following a huge search operation involving more than 650 people they were found \u2018scared and cold\u2019 but \u2018cheerful\u2019 that their ordeal was finally over. They told rescuers that \u2018wolves approached them in the forest, but their two young beagle dogs, who were with the children, scared off the predators\u2019. Vika and Grisha were taken to hospital where they were reunited with their mother Alfiya as they underwent health checks. She was seen hugging the children in the hospital ward, telling Grisha: \u2018I wasn\u2019t worried. I believed in you! I knew you were fine. \u2018I was confident in you, in Rocky, in Ryzhiy. Son, I believed you.\u2019 Vika and Grisha were taken to hospital where they were reunited with their mother Alfiya (Picture: social media/e2w) Rescuer Igor Grekov said: \u2018Four of us were riding on two ATVs when they were discovered. They didn\u2019t panic. I was actually surprised. \u2018We stopped and shouted every 200 metres. They heard us, but could not shout back, since their voices were already strained.\u2019 They were eventually found four-and-a-half miles from the village of Burmakina, where they had gone missing near the family\u2019s remote country cottage used in summer. Their grandfather appeared four days ago after the fishing expedition but had recently had a stroke and was unable to explain clearly what had happened or how they got separated from him. But rescuers think the Vika and Grisha walked tens of miles as they sought to find their way out of the forest. Rescuers in dozens of search teams covered more than 800 miles searching for them. There was a major scare yesterday when a bear was found that appeared to be guarding its prey and refusing to move. Rescuers with one of the beagles, who stayed with Vika and Grisha, warming them at night and scaring away the wolves (Picture: e1_news/e2w) There was such concern for the children that a murder case was officially opened and the Russian military was deployed. It was an aerial thermal imager that detected the suspected bear. One theory is that returning from fishing, the children had run ahead of their grandfather to get to the village to buy drinks, but had taken the wrong turn. \u2018They told their grandfather \u201cdon\u2019t rush, you will catch up with us\u201d, but without realising it, they were going in a different direction,\u2019 their mum said. She added that as the search went on that she \u2018blamed herself\u2019 for leaving the children with their grandfather while she was working in the city.

The curtain has fallen on the group stage events with the qualification of the teams of Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, England, Denmark, Slovenia, Austria, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey and Georgia to the round of 16 of the continental tournament. One of the most prominent players who performed strongly in the Euro was Antonio Rudiger, who started all three matches that Germany played in the tournament held on home soil. Born in Berlin to a German father of African origin, Matthias, and a Sierra Leonean mother, Lily, Rudiger played 270 minutes at Euro 2024, and has performed at an outstanding level as usual recently with his team, Real Madrid, but that did not prevent him from making some mistakes that, fortunately, did not affect his team\u2019s fate in the tournament. Rudiger recovered the ball from players of the opposing teams 21 times, including three tackles, and his accuracy in clearing the ball from his team\u2019s penalty area reached 100%, with 11 successful clearances. Rudiger\u2019s passing accuracy was 94%, with 251 successful passes out of 267 over the three matches, and his top speed was 33.4 km/h. Rudiger made four attempts on the opponents\u2019 goal but failed to score. He even caused an own goal against Germany against Scotland and received a yellow card against Hungary. Among the German national team, Jamal Musiala, the star of Bayern Munich, also shined after participating mainly in the three matches for his country for 222 minutes, an average of 74 minutes per match, as he was always substituted in the second half of the matches. Musiala is one of the African players in the ranks of the German national team, as Musiala was born in Germany to a Nigerian father and a German mother, of Polish origins. His total number of offensive attempts reached 5, making him the fourth German player who shot on goal in the tournament. Musiala passed 99 correct passes and the accuracy of his passes reached 94.34% and its maximum speed reached 33.21 kilometers per hour. The third player who has proven his presence in Germany is Leroy Sane, although he has not been able to score or create goals yet. San\u00e9 is the son of Regina Weber, a former German rhythmic gymnast and bronze medalist at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, and former Senegalese international footballer Souleymane San\u00e9. Sane participated as a substitute in the three matches that Germany played in the group stage, with a total of 72 minutes, during which he did not receive any yellow or red card. He made seven attempts on the opponents\u2019 goal and is considered the second German player to shoot on goal after Kai Havertz. He also sent 30 passes. Correct with an accuracy rate of 86.6%. Jonathan Tah, a Bayer Leverkusen defender born to an Ivorian father and a German mother, also shined in the ranks of the German national team, and is considered a strong pillar in the \u201cManschaft\u201d defense line, which conceded only two goals in the first round. Tah started all three matches, playing 241 minutes and was distinguished by his ferocity in retrieving the ball from opponents 14 times, as well as the accuracy of his passes, which slightly exceeded 94%. His speed reached 33.9 km/h, which helped him cover 27.71 km in the first round matches. But Tah caused a future crisis for the German national team before the start of the knockout stages, as he received two yellow cards, confirming his absence from the match against Denmark in the second round due to his suspension for accumulating cards. In the ranks of the French national team, its star and captain, Kylian Mbappe, born to a Cameroonian father and an Algerian mother, did not surrender to the severe injury he sustained with a broken nose during the last minutes of the match against Austria in the first round of Group D. The French national team scored two goals in three matches in the first round, with a direct imprint of Mbappe, as he raised a cross ball that Austria defender Maximilian Weber accidentally completed into his own net, while he scored the only goal against Poland from a penalty kick in the third round match, which ended in a 1-1 draw, contributing to his country reaching the round. 16th runner-up in Group 4, behind Austria, the surprise of the tournament. His teammate Jules Kounde, the Barcelona defender born to a Beninese father and a French mother, was an indispensable pillar for French coach Didier Deschamps regarding his choices for the back four. Kounde started all three of France\u2019s group stage matches, won the ball back 18 times and had a passing accuracy of 88.67%. On the other hand, N\u2019Golo Kante is considered one of the important elements that the French team relied on, and he is considered one of the most prominent stars of African origin in the \u201cRoosters\u201d ranks, noting that he was born in Paris to Malian parents. Kante, the midfielder for the Saudi Al-Ittihad team, participated in the three matches in the first round, with a total of 241 minutes played. Kante was unable to score or assist any goal during the French national team\u2019s campaign in the group stage, but he fired 3 shots at the opponents\u2019 goal, none of which were correct, and his total passes reached 151 passes with an accuracy rate of 90.7%. For his part, Aurelien Chouamini, the Real Madrid player and of Cameroonian origins, participated in two of France\u2019s three matches in the group stage, with a total of 171 playing minutes. Tshwamini did not score any goals or assists, and his pass accuracy rate was 92%. He covered 20 kilometers of space in the midfield, and did not receive any yellow or red cards in the two matches. As for his teammate in the French national team, Dayot Upamecano, who is of Guinea-Bissau origin, he participated in all three matches, for 270 minutes, and his passing accuracy reached 93%, but he caused the penalty kick from which the Polish national team scored the equalizing goal against his country. Young winger Nico Williams, born to Ghanaian parents, stole the show as Spain topped Group B. Athletic Bilbao winger Nico Williams played in the first two matches, contributing to the 3-0 win over Croatia in the first round, then winning the man of the match award after contributing to the only winning goal against Italy before missing the match against Albania. Spain\u2019s Lamine Yamal is one of the shining lights of Euro 2024 thanks to the record he set during the match against Croatia when he became the youngest player ever to participate in the European Nations Cup, at the age of 16 years and 338 days, breaking the record of Poland\u2019s Kasper Kazlowski. Barcelona star Yamal participated in Spain\u2019s three matches in Euro 2024 for a total of 176 minutes, reaching the opponents\u2019 goal with four attempts. He provided a decisive pass to his teammate Dani Carvajal, but he did not know the way to the net yet, but the post prevented him from scoring a certain goal. Yamal, who was born to a Moroccan father and an Equatorial Guinean mother, had a passing accuracy of 76.67 and a top speed of 31.6 km/h. On the other hand, Cody Gakpo shone remarkably with the Dutch national team in the group stage, scoring two goals out of five for the Windmills. Jacobo was born in Togo to a father of Ghanaian origins, while his mother holds Dutch citizenship. The total minutes he played in the group stage reached 261 minutes. The total number of shots made by Jacobo in the three matches was 6, with 4 correct shots. He has the highest number of shots between the goalposts and the crossbar in his team and the third among all players in the competition. On the other hand, luck was not on Belgian Romelu Lukaku\u2019s side, who scored three goals in the European Championship, but it was canceled after the intervention of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology. Lukaku was born in Antwerp to parents of Democratic Republic of the Congo origin, and despite not scoring, he played a pivotal role in Belgium\u2019s qualification to the round of 16 after starting all three of his country\u2019s matches, playing 269 minutes at a rate of 89.67 minutes per match. Although his goals were not counted, Lukaku managed to create one goal, and his total attempts on goal amounted to ten shots.", "summary": "<p>The participation of players of African origin in the European Nations Cup &#8220;Euro 2024&#8221; in Germany varied, as some of them contributed to their national teams reaching the knockout stages, while others did not provide the expected performance, while some of them were not lucky enough to participate during the group stage events, but perhaps [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://thenewsglory.com/mixed-participation-of-african-origins-in-euro-2024/\">Mixed participation of African origins in Euro 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://thenewsglory.com\">The News Glory</a>.</p>", "url": "https://thenewsglory.com/mixed-participation-of-african-origins-in-euro-2024/", "image": "https://www.emaratalyoum.com/polopoly_fs/1.1864213.1719635420!/image/image.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:21:24", "author": "The News Glory", "authors": ["The News Glory"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.253}

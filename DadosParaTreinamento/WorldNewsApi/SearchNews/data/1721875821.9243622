With Tom Kim still in the lead at 18-under, Scottie Scheffler and Akshay Bhatia right on his tail and the course only getting softer with all of the rain it took during delays Friday and Saturday, the winning score will likely be in the 20s again. And there are a handful of players, five who are three shots back or less, still in contention for the $3.6 million winning share of the event\u2019s $20 million purse. The first shape on Kim\u2019s scorecard Saturday was a foreign one. The 22-year-old from South Korea suffered his only bogey through 54 holes on No. 4, which he had to three-putt. He responded with back-to-back birdies on the next two holes to tie Bhatia at the top of the leaderboard, just before the horn sounded to stop play at 3:30 p.m. Kim, looking for his fourth-career win on the PGA Tour and his first this season, came out of the delay and shot 3-under on the back nine to finish 54 holes at 18-under 192. \u201cThe greens were really soft (after the delay) and fairways were soft and there\u2019s no wind, so obviously there were a lot of birdies out there, I\u2019m sure a lot of guys did. I didn\u2019t really look at leaderboards, but when you get soft conditions out there it\u2019s definitely gettable and I feel like I executed well enough to have a good round today,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt\u2019s a stacked leaderboard, out here a 5-, 6-shot lead is not safe at all. So I have to go out tomorrow and do the same game plan and execute.\u201d The leaderboard certainly is stacked. Three Olympians are within three shots of the lead. One is world No. 1 Scheffler, the first golfer with five wins in a PGA Tour season since Justin Thomas in 2016-17. Scheffler shot 3-under on the front nine, got into trouble with a couple of bogeys on the back but closed his round with four birdies consecutive birdies to complete his second-straight 6-under 64 round. Scheffler was grouped with Bhatia on Saturday, and the two fed off one another. Bhatia also finished at 6-under 64 to tie his partner at 17-under for the tournament, each of them made similar highlights with birdie on the final two holes. \u201cI was pretty nervous stepping on that first tee today playing with him,\u201d Bhatia, 22, admitted. \u201cFor us to finish the way we did was really good because we were just trying to get done, and I think the pace that we played at and the shots we were hitting, it kind of added up to a nice score.\u201d Said Scheffler: \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re in pairs you can feed off each other the wrong or the right way. Today, especially at the end, we were feeding off each other what I would say in the right way. It\u2019s always a good thing.\u201d Xander Schauffele, the 2022 champion who exited two shots behind the lead at 16-under 194 despite the fatigue that he hasn\u2019t been able to shake, shot his best round of the tournament so far at 6-under 64. Kim, Scheffler and Bhatia will be in the lead group in Sunday\u2019s final round, which is set to begin at 6:50 a.m. \u201cIt really depends on the weather. I think I saw that the wind were goings to be up a little bit and depends if we get more rain overnight,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cSo there will be a bit, a few different factors going into it, but I\u2019ll wake up tomorrow, see how the course is playing and go from there.\u201d", "summary": "The final round of the 2024 Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands is shaping up to be a shootout with Tom Kim the solo leader, closely followed by stars.", "url": "https://www.courant.com/2024/06/22/tom-kim-holds-lead-as-stacked-travelers-championship-leaderboard-readies-for-final-round/", "image": "https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/THC-Travelers-Third-Round-9-1.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:12:10", "author": "Joe Arruda", "authors": ["Joe Arruda"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.076}

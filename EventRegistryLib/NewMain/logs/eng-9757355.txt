It has also sparked warnings of famine.\n\nPrevious talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, repeatedly failed to end the fighting, yielding only temporary truces last year that were all immediately broken by both sides.\n\nSubsequent mediation attempts, including by the African Union, have failed to get the warring parties into the same room, as experts said both forces vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nIndirect talks between the RSF and Sudanese military, held this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nThe talks focused on humanitarian aid and protecting civilians, though neither side met directly with the other.\n\n\"The scale of death, suffering and destruction in Sudan is devastating. This senseless conflict must end,\" Blinken said.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters on Tuesday that the goal of the talks in Switzerland was to build on work from Jeddah and

Saudi Arabia will co-host the talks, while the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations will act as observers, according to Blinken.\n\nBlinken said the \"horrific conflict\" in Sudan \"has pushed millions to the brink of starvation and displaced nearly 10 million people.\"\n\n\"It continues to cause immeasurable suffering for the Sudanese people. The United States remains committed to working with partners to end this devastating war,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe war in Sudan broke out in April 2023 when the RSF and the SAF clashed over control of the country following collaboration between both groups to dissolve a transitional government that had been set up following the 2019 ouster of a longtime authoritarian leader.\n\nThe fighting continues to escalate as the RSF takes control of more territory, mostly large swaths of the southeast and southwest, including the region of Darfur, where the international community largely considers a genocide to have taken place against the ethnic non-Arab population in 2003.\n\nBoth the RSF and the SAF have been accused of war crimes, with the RSF, which rose out of the Janjaweed Arab militia groups in 2003, accused of possibly repeating the Darfur genocide. Blinken said in a December statement that fighters from both militias have attacked and kidnapped women and abused detainees.\n\nThe U.S. tried to broker talks to end the war shortly after it broke out to little success, and efforts in October and December also failed. The Biden administration has also imposed visa restrictions and sanctions on the RSF and SAF.\n\nBlinken said in his Tuesday statement that the talks in Switzerland aim to reach a ceasefire, enable humanitarian access and develop a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure any agreement can be implemented.\n\nThe talks \"do not aim to address broader political issues,\" Blinken added.\n\n\"As the Sudanese people have long demanded, Sudan's governance must return to civilians and civilians must play the leading role in defining a process to address political issues and restore Sudan's democratic transition,\" he said. \"The scale of death, suffering, and destruction in Sudan is devastating. This senseless conflict must end.\n\n\"The United States calls upon the SAF and the RSF to attend the talks and approach them constructively, with the imperative to save lives, stop the fighting, and

The US on Tuesday invited the RSF and Sudanese army to meet for talks in Switzerland on August 14, as efforts to end the conflict mount.\n\nThe US announced that the negotiations will be co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations as observers.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement: \"The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement.\"\n\nSudan's army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has yet to respond to the invitation. Dagalo said that the invitation to negotiate was \"welcome\".\n\n\"We reaffirm our firm stance ... which is the insistence on saving lives, stopping the fighting, and paving the way for a peaceful, negotiated political solution that restores the country to civilian rule and the path of democratic transition,\" the paramilitary leader said in a post on X.\n\nThe brutal war between the RSF and the military government has raged in Sudan since April 2023. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and almost 10 million displaced, according to the United Nations, amid reports of numerous war crimes by both sides and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nA UN report issued on Tuesday found that nearly 26 million people in Sudan are not getting enough food due to the war.\n\nBlinken said that Washington remains \"committed to working with partners to end this devastating war\".\n\n\"These talks do not aim to address broader political issues. As the Sudanese people have long demanded, Sudan's governance must return to civilians and civilians must play the leading role in defining a process to address political issues and restore Sudan's democratic transition,\" he said.\n\nHowever, efforts so far to bring the war to an end have been met with little success.\n\nDirect talks in Saudi Arabia last year between the RSF and the army produced only agreements for temporary truces - which were quickly violated - and repeatedly failed to end the war.\n\nSubsequent mediation attempts have failed to get the warring sides into the same room, as both vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nIndirect talks held earlier this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the goal of the talks in Switzerland would be to try to resurrect and build on last year's talks in Jeddah.\n\nBoth the RSF and the army continue to trade accusations of war crimes, including deliberately targeting civilians, indiscriminately shelling residential areas, and blocking humanitarian

Blinken, Secretary of State\n\nOver the past 15 months, the horrific conflict in Sudan has pushed millions to the brink of starvation and displaced nearly 10 million people. It continues to cause immeasurable suffering for the Sudanese people. The United States remains committed to working with partners to end this devastating war. Building from the earlier Jeddah processes co-facilitated with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United States has invited the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to participate in ceasefire talks mediated by the United States to begin on August 14, 2024, in Switzerland. We thank the government of Switzerland for offering to host the talks and welcome the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a co-host. The talks will include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations as observers.\n\nThe talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement.\n\nThese talks do not aim to address broader political issues. As the Sudanese people have long demanded, Sudan's governance must return to civilians and civilians must play the leading role in defining a process to address political issues and restore Sudan's democratic transition.\n\nThe scale of death, suffering, and destruction in Sudan is devastating. This senseless conflict must end. The United States calls upon the SAF and the RSF to attend the talks and approach them constructively, with the imperative to save lives, stop the fighting, and create a path to a negotiated political solution to the conflict. We join the Sudanese people's calls for peace and a democratic transition, and we urge the parties to stop the fighting for the sake of a brighter future for Sudan.\n\nbody { font-size: 1em; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;

Tuesday that it had invited Sudan's warring sides to hold ceasefire talks in Switzerland next month.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had invited Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to start US-mediated negotiations beginning on August 14.\n\n\"The United States remains committed to working with partners to end this devastating war,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe commander of the RSF, at war with the army for over a year, said he \"welcomed\" Blinken's invitation and that his side would join the negotiations.\n\n\"I declare our participation in the upcoming ceasefire talks on August 14, 2024, in Switzerland,\" Mohamed Hamdan Daglo wrote on social media site X.\n\nPrevious negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, have failed to put an end to fighting that has displaced millions, sparked warnings of famine and left swaths of the capital Khartoum in ruins.\n\nSubsequent mediation attempts, including by the African Union, have failed to get the warring parties in the same room, as experts said both forces vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nFor more than a year, the brutal war has raged in the northeast African country between the regular military under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF led by his former deputy Daglo.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and uprooted more than 10 million people, including two million who have fled across borders, according to the United Nations.\n\n\"The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement,\" Blinken said.\n\nThe US-mediated talks will be co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and will include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations as observers, the State Department said.\n\n- 'No military solution' -\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that \"there is no military solution to the conflict in Sudan.\"\n\n\"Convening these national ceasefire talks and making clear that they are backed by key international stakeholders is the only way to prove to end the conflict,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the chances of the talks succeeding, however, Miller acknowledged that \"we just want to get the parties back to the table,\" calling it \"the best shot that we have right now at getting a nationwide cessation of violence.\"\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes including deliberately targeting civilians, indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, and blocking humanitarian aid, while the fighting has caused many humanitarian organizations to cease operations in the country.\n\nA recent UN-backed report said nearly 26 million people, or slightly more than half of the population, were facing high levels of \"acute food insecurity.\"\n\nIndirect talks between the RSF and Sudanese military, held this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nThe talks focused on humanitarian aid and protecting civilians, though neither side met directly with the other.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

AFP\n\nThe United States announced Tuesday that it had invited Sudan's warring sides to hold ceasefire talks in Switzerland next month.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had invited Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to start US-mediated negotiations beginning on August 14.\n\n\"The United States remains committed to working with partners to end this devastating war,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe commander of the RSF, at war with the army for over a year, said he \"welcomed\" Blinken's invitation and that his side would join the negotiations.\n\n\"I declare our participation in the upcoming ceasefire talks on August 14, 2024, in Switzerland,\" Mohamed Hamdan Daglo wrote on social media site X.\n\nPrevious negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, have failed to put an end to fighting that has displaced millions, sparked warnings of famine and left swaths of the capital Khartoum in ruins.\n\nSubsequent mediation attempts, including by the African Union, have failed to get the warring parties in the same room, as experts said both forces vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nFor more than a year, the brutal war has raged in the northeast African country between the regular military under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF led by his former deputy Daglo.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and uprooted more than 10 million people, including two million who have fled across borders, according to the United Nations.\n\n\"The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement,\" Blinken said.\n\nThe US-mediated talks will be co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and will include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations as observers, the State Department said.\n\n'No military solution'\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that \"there is no military solution to the conflict in Sudan.\"\n\n\"Convening these national ceasefire talks and making clear that they are backed by key international stakeholders is the only way to prove to end the conflict,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the chances of the talks succeeding, however, Miller acknowledged that \"we just want to get the parties back to the table,\" calling it \"the best shot that we have right now at getting a nationwide cessation of violence.\"\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes including deliberately targeting civilians, indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, and blocking humanitarian aid, while the fighting has caused many humanitarian organizations to cease operations in the country.\n\nA recent UN-backed report said nearly 26 million people, or slightly more than half of the population, were facing high levels of \"acute food insecurity.\"\n\nIndirect talks between the RSF and Sudanese military, held this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nThe talks focused on humanitarian aid and protecting civilians, though neither side met directly with the other.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

States announced Tuesday that it had invited Sudan's warring sides to hold ceasefire talks in Switzerland next month.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had invited Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to start US-mediated negotiations beginning on August 14.\n\n\"The United States remains committed to working with partners to end this devastating war,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe commander of the RSF, at war with the army for over a year, said he \"welcomed\" Blinken's invitation and that his side would join the negotiations.\n\n\"I declare our participation in the upcoming ceasefire talks on August 14, 2024, in Switzerland,\" Mohamed Hamdan Daglo wrote on social media site X.\n\nPrevious negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, have failed to put an end to fighting that has displaced millions, sparked warnings of famine and left swaths of the capital Khartoum in ruins.\n\nSubsequent mediation attempts, including by the African Union, have failed to get the warring parties in the same room, as experts said both forces vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nFor more than a year, the brutal war has raged in the northeast African country between the regular military under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF led by his former deputy Daglo.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and uprooted more than 10 million people, including two million who have fled across borders, according to the United Nations.\n\n\"The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement,\" Blinken said.\n\nThe US-mediated talks will be co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and will include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations as observers, the State Department said.\n\n- 'No military solution' -\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that \"there is no military solution to the conflict in Sudan.\"\n\n\"Convening these national ceasefire talks and making clear that they are backed by key international stakeholders is the only way to prove to end the conflict,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the chances of the talks succeeding, however, Miller acknowledged that \"we just want to get the parties back to the table,\" calling it \"the best shot that we have right now at getting a nationwide cessation of violence.\"\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes including deliberately targeting civilians, indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, and blocking humanitarian aid, while the fighting has caused many humanitarian organizations to cease operations in the country.\n\nA recent UN-backed report said nearly 26 million people, or slightly more than half of the population, were facing high levels of \"acute food insecurity.\"\n\nIndirect talks between the RSF and Sudanese military, held this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nThe talks focused on humanitarian aid and protecting civilians, though neither side met directly with the other.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors":

report issued on Tuesday found that nearly 26 million people in Sudan are not getting enough food due to the war.\n\nBlinken said that Washington remains \"committed to working with partners to end this devastating war\".\n\nHowever, efforts so far to bring the war to an end have been met with little success.\n\nDirect talks in Saudi Arabia last year between the RSF and the army produced only agreements for temporary truces - which were quickly violated - and repeatedly failed to end the war.\n\nSubsequent mediation attempts have failed to get the warring sides into the same room, as both vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nIndirect talks held earlier this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the goal of the talks in Switzerland would be to try to resurrect and build on last year's talks in Jeddah.\n\nBoth the RSF and the army continue to trade accusations of war crimes, including deliberately targeting civilians, indiscriminately shelling residential areas, and blocking humanitarian aid.", "source": {"uri":

the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces to start US-mediated negotiations beginning on August 14.\n\n\"The United States remains committed to working with partners to end this devastating war,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nNeither side has committed to attending the talks, and previous negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, have failed to put an end to fighting that has displaced millions, sparked warnings of famine and left swaths of the capital Khartoum in ruins.\n\nFor more than a year, a brutal war has raged in the northeast African country between the regular military under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF led by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and uprooted more than 10 million people, including two

August 14.\n\n\"The United States remains committed to working with partners to end this devastating war,\" Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe commander of the RSF, at war with the army for over a year, said he \"welcomed\" Blinken's invitation and that his side would join the negotiations.\n\n\"I declare our participation in the upcoming ceasefire talks on August 14, 2024, in Switzerland,\" Mohamed Hamdan Daglo wrote on social media site X.\n\nPrevious negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, have failed to put an end to fighting that has displaced millions, sparked warnings of famine and left swaths of the capital Khartoum in ruins.\n\nSubsequent mediation attempts, including by the African Union, have failed to get the warring parties in the same room, as experts said both forces vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nFor more than a year, the brutal war has raged in the northeast African country between the regular military under army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the RSF led by his former deputy Daglo.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and uprooted more than 10 million people, including two million who have fled across borders,

to the conflict in Sudan.\"\n\n\"Convening these national ceasefire talks and making clear that they are backed by key international stakeholders is the only way to prove to end the conflict,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the chances of the talks succeeding, however, Miller acknowledged that \"we just want to get the parties back to the table,\" calling it \"the best shot that we have right now at getting a nationwide cessation of violence.\"\n\nBoth sides have been accused of war crimes including deliberately targeting civilians, indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, and blocking humanitarian aid, while the fighting has caused many humanitarian organizations to cease operations in the country.\n\nA recent UN-backed report said nearly 26 million people, or slightly more than half of the population, were facing high levels of \"acute food insecurity.\"\n\nIndirect talks between the RSF and Sudanese military, held this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nThe talks focused on humanitarian aid and protecting civilians, though neither side met

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the U.N.\n\nThe talks focused on humanitarian aid and protecting civilians, though neither side met directly with the other.\n\nUN investigators decry patterns of grave violations in Sudan\n\nA team of U.N. investigators said they had met in Chad with victims of violence in Sudan's brutal civil war and had documented \"disturbing patterns\" of grave abuses.\n\nThe recently established U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the situation in Sudan said it had spent three weeks in Chad meeting with survivors of the conflict in Sudan, members of Sudanese civil society and other observers.\n\nThe people they spoke to had detailed firsthand accounts of \"horrific acts of killings, sexual violence, including gang rape\", the team said in a statement.\n\n\"These brutal

the warring parties in the same room, as experts said both forces vied for the tactical advantage on the ground.\n\nFor more than a year, the brutal war has raged in the northeast African country

military, held this month in Geneva by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, were called an \"encouraging\" first step by the UN.\n\nThe talks focused on

Abdel-Fattah Burhan, told The Associated Press that no decision has been made on whether it will send a delegation to the talks.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the talks will aim to build on discussions between the two sides that broke down late last year in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt said the African Union, Sudan's neighbor Egypt, the United Arab Emirates -- which has been accused of supporting Dagalo's forces with weapons, a claim UAE officials have denied -- and the United Nations would act as observers.\n\n\"The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Tuesday announcing the talks.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions including Darfur. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. Rights activists say the toll could be much higher.\n\nThe war has also created the world's largest displacement crisis with over 11 million people forced to flee their homes, as well as allegations of rampant sexual violence and possible crimes against humanity. International experts recently warned that 755,000 people are facing famine in the coming months.\n\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the invitation for the talks went out Tuesday.

imperative to save lives, stop the fighting and create a path to a negotiated political solution to the conflict,\" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe invitation follows talks in Geneva with the UN Secretary General's personal envoy, Ramtane Lamamra, where the warring sides spoke to the envoy separately.\n\nThe military and the RSF have been in conflict since April last year, when a power struggle between Gen Abdel Fattah Al Burhan and his one-time ally Gen Mohamed Dagalo, who leads the paramilitary group, turned into war.\n\nThe UN estimates that more than 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured since the conflict began 15 months ago.\n\nA recent report by Integrated Food Security Phase Classification stated that 25.6 million people in Sudan do not have access to sufficient levels of food, and that 14 areas across the African nation are at risk of famine.\n\nMore than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the violence, creating the largest displacement crisis in the world.\n\n\"There is a horrific human tragedy taking place there right now,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\n\"There's two parties that continue to fight each other and put civilians at risk and bring civilians not just into direct harm, but harm through the humanitarian crisis that has been created.\n\n\"So we're looking for anything we can do to get these talks restarted and try to get a ceasefire.\"\n\nWashington and Riyadh tried to broker a ceasefire in the months after the outbreak of hostilities but the warring sides broke off communication at the end of last year.\n\nSubsequent efforts have failed to deliver any tangible results.\n\n\"The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement,\" Mr Blinken

Rights activists say the toll could be much higher.\n\nThe war has also created the world\u00b4s largest displacement crisis with over 11 million people forced to flee their homes, as well as allegations of rampant sexual violence and possible crimes against humanity. International experts recently warned that 755,000 people are facing famine in the coming months.\n\nValentin Clivaz, a spokesperson for the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs, said in an email that Switzerland would co-host the talks and \"hails all efforts aiming to resolve the conflict through negotiation.\"\n\nLast week, the U.N. secretary-general's envoy for Sudan hosted a series of indirect

Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the Rapid Support Forces fighting Sudan's army, expressed hope on social media late Tuesday that the talks would become \"a major step\" toward peace and stability in Sudan and create a new state based on \"justice, equality and federal rule.\"\n\n\"We share with the international community the goal of achieving a full cease-fire across the country and facilitating humanitarian access to everyone in need,\" he said on X, formerly called Twitter,\n\nThe talks are expected to begin Aug. 14 at an as-yet unspecified location in Switzerland.\n\nThere was no immediate public indication whether Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the head of the Sudanese armed forces, or another top envoy from the military would also attend.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said the talks will aim to build on discussions between the two sides that broke down late last year in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt said the African Union, Sudan's neighbor Egypt, the United Arab Emirates -- which has supported Dagalo's forces -- and the United Nations would act as observers.\n\n\"The talks in Switzerland aim to reach a nationwide cessation of violence, enabling humanitarian access to all those in need, and develop a robust monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure implementation of any agreement,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Tuesday announcing the talks.\n\n\"These talks do not aim to address broader political issues,\" he added.\n\nSudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions including Darfur. The U.N. says over 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. Rights activists say the toll could be much higher.\n\nThe war has also created the world's largest displacement crisis with over 11 million people forced to flee their homes, as well as allegations of rampant sexual violence and possible crimes against humanity. International experts recently warned that 755,000 people are facing famine in the coming months.\n\nValentin Clivaz, a spokesperson for the Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs, said in an email that Switzerland would co-host the talks and \"hails all efforts aiming to resolve the conflict through negotiation.\"\n\nLast week, the U.N. secretary-general's envoy for Sudan hosted a series of indirect talks in Geneva between the two sides centering on issues of humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians across Sudan.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The U.S. official said the U.S. is also looking into civilian participation at the talks. The talks are expected to be attended by representatives of the warring parties, who met separately with a U.N. envoy.\n\nIt comes as talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, broke down at the end of last year, with the warring parties refusing to budge or honor their commitments under the Jeddah declaration. However, recently concluded talks in Geneva were described by The U.N. Secretary-General's Personal Envoy for Sudan Ramtane Lamamra as an \"encouraging initial step\" in the complex process.\n\nIn a statement posted on X, Rapid Support Forces Paramilitary Group (RSF) chief Mohamed Daglo -- commonly known as Hemedti -- said the RSF is \"ready to deal with these talks constructively.\" He said he welcomed the invitation by U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.\n\nSudanese Army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was yet to make a public statement on the invitation.\n\nThe scheduled negotiations arrive as the war in Sudan approaches its 16th month, U.N. Spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric in a briefing on Tuesday, adding that the U.N. \"continues to be extremely alarmed\" by the situation.\n\n\"Almost 26 million men, women and children are acutely hungry,\" said Dujarric. \"The equivalent to the entire population of Australia. 750,000 people are just one step away from famine.\"\n\nOn April 15, 2023, war broke out in Sudan's capital Khartoum following months of tensions between the SAF and RSF paramilitary group linked to a planned transition to civilian rule. Fighting has since spread across the northeast African nation and intensified with allied militias joining the fight.\n\nThe conflict has precipitated the world's \"largest internal displacement crisis,\" driving over 10 million people -- about 20% of Sudan's population -- from their homes according to the U.N.'s International Office of Migration. At least 16,000 people have been killed according to the U.N.\n\nA new report by Doctors Without Borders this week revealed civilians are enduring \"horrific levels of violence,\" with thousands across the country being treated for war-related injuries caused by explosions, gunshots and stabbings amid \"shocking\" reports of sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\"The scale of death, suffering, and destruction in Sudan is devastating. This senseless conflict must end,\" said the U.S. State Department in a statement. \"The United States calls upon the SAF and the RSF to attend the talks and approach them constructively, with the imperative to save lives, stop the fighting, and create a path to a negotiated political solution to the conflict.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"},

Reports from Sudanese medical professionals still inside the tattered country say the health system has collapsed, compounding the crisis\n\nSudan is the largest hunger and displacement crisis in the world today.\n\n\"The warring parties must take this opportunity to end fighting, continue to improve humanitarian access for the Sudanese people, and work toward a brighter future for Sudan,\" U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan Tom Perriello said in a post on X following the announcement. The African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and the United Nations will take part as observers, the Secretary said.\n\nBlinken said next month's talk would build on Saudi-led efforts that fizzled late last year. Efforts to rekindle the process in April also failed, partly due to half-hearted responses from two warring factions. Each is determined to expand areas it controls and to hold them as long as possible.\n\nA podcast in March by the UK think-tank Chatham House, presented research on how minerals, gold, in particular, are fueling the war. On one side is the Sudan Armed Forces, an administration that Sudan's democracy movement regards as illegitimate. On the other is a rebel militia called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), dominated by fighters who perpetrated the genocide in Darfur province from 2003 to 2005 and have resumed genocidal tactics in the current conflict. In a further complication for U.S. policy makers, the Saudis excluded Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, the latter seen as a prime supporter of the RSF.\n\nSudanese non-combatants - some still trying to help hungry, injured people inside the country, even as they themselves have been forced to flee back-and-forth, with no safe areas - face insurmountable obstacles. As many as 2.5 million have managed to cross borders into poorly supplied refugee camps in neighboring countries, but tens of millions remain trapped and on the run inside the country.\n\nA few, mostly educated professionals, managed to get to Europe and elsewhere. Advocating for a durable peace, they are critical of the strategies of U.S. and other mediators. \"The danger,\" Kholood Khair, founding director of a Sudan-based analytical organization, said from London on a panel organized by the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, \"is that if they strike a deal with each other, they will turbo-charge their repressive acts against the Sudanese people\".\n\nTalks between men with guns, with no civilians and no women participating, will not lead to durable peace.\n\nBlinken acknowledged the criticism in his statement, saying \"broader political issues\" are not the aim of next month's talks. \"As the Sudanese people have long demanded, Sudan's governance must return to civilians and civilians must play the leading role in defining a process to address political issues and restore Sudan's democratic transition.\"\n\nA report issued this week by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res describes in horrific detail how both the SAF and RSF and their supporters are inflicting \"horrendous\" violence on people across the country. Fighting has led to a collapse in the protection of civilians across the large country with communities facing \"indiscriminate violence, killings, and torture\".\n\nKhair said the lack of effective responses from U.S. and European policymakers faced with such a catastrophic humanitarian crisis reflects \"a taxonomy of suffering\" where Sudanese people rank at the bottom\" contrasted with those in Ukraine or other European nations. Less explainable, she said, is the lack of appreciation for the geopolitical centrality of Sudan.\n\nThose issues also were posed by Michelle Gavin, CFR's senior fellow for Africa policy studies, and the two other panelists, Kate Almquist Knopf, a former USAID Africa official and former director of the Africa Center for Strategic Studies and mission director in Sudan, and Susan Stigant, director of Africa programs at the United States Institute of Peace.\n\nKnopf said that even if the plight of Sudan's people isn't considered, it is difficult to explain \"the fact that we will tolerate any state collapse of this magnitude\", noting \"Russia securing a port, Iran reestablishing a presence, connection across the belt of instability and coups in the Sahel, and the largest and most important maritime artery leading from the Red Sea into the Mediterranean\". Stigant said that \"seeing this as a fight between two parties doesn't capture the complexity and the risk...\".\n\nGavin, a former U.S. ambassador to Botswana, said the importance of the Red Sea region to the global economy \"makes it all the more puzzling that we have such an absence of strategic clarity about U.S. policy\". She said the avalanche of human suffering, despite warnings at every stage of the conflict, feels like \"an ongoing testament to the failure of the world's peace, security, humanitarian and human rights architecture\".\n\nThe avalanche of human suffering is a failure of the world's peace and security architecture.\n\nAnother critique of the U.S.-convened talks was the absence of women. \"I was just with a group of Sudanese women who came together to articulate a draft set principles and priorities of how they define security themselves.\" Yet, she said, \"the United States was facilitating talks between belligerents, men with guns, with no women present, with no mechanism for women's involvement\".\n\nEarlier this month, representatives of the two warring factions held indirect talks in Geneva focused on humanitarian assistance and protection for civilians. After 20 sessions with the delegations held separately, the UN secretary-general's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, called the discussions a good initial step but announced no breakthroughs.\n\nThe African Union, which has stepped up efforts to resolve the conflict, convened an Inter-Sudanese Political Dialogue in Addis Ababa earlier this month, led by Dr. Mohamed Ibn Chambas, Chair of the AU High-Level Panel on Resolution of the Conflict in Sudan.\n\nThe Sudanese groups participating produced 17 recommendations covering \"ending the war, humanitarian access to relief the suffering Sudanese population, the inclusivity of the dialogue, the agenda, transitional justice, the form of transitional governance, to mention a few,\" Chambas said in closing remarks. \"Sudanese political and civil actors who were unable to attend the meeting\" will be consulted, he said, and the Panel will continue engagement with women, youth, professional groups and traditional authorities\n\nLast week at the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced a new package of humanitarian assistance for people affected by the conflict in Sudan, including refugees in neighboring countries.\n\nThe challenge will be getting aid to those who most need it. United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director Cindy McCain, who visited refugee camps in March, warned then that over 25 million people were \"trapped in a spiral of deteriorating food security\" and that \"WFP is unable to get sufficient emergency food assistance to desperate communities in Sudan...because of the relentless violence and interference by the warring parties\".\n\nKhair wants to see substantive new directions in international approaches to Sudan. \"But quite frankly\" she said, with Sudan having \"such a little footprint in both media circles and in policy circles, I don't think we're going to see that anytime soon\".\n\nA few hours after the Blinken statement, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the RSF leader, in a post on X welcomed the invitation and said \"I declare our participation in the upcoming ceasefire talks. The SAF, which did not immediately respond - as was anticipated by State Department officials involved in the planning - are under pressure from several allied countries to participate.", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudanese Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Perriello", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Perriello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Darfur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambassadors_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambassadors of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aid agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Institute_of_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Institute of Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_A._Knopf", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alfred A.

The war in Sudan is as senseless as it is destructive.\n\nThe same armed actors that preempted a complete civilian overthrow of the dictatorial government in 2019--the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)--eventually turned on each other in 2023, robbing the country of the promise of the revolution, committing horrific atrocities, and destroying the very country they claim to wish to lead.\n\nAn approach that elevates the issue and provides a focal point for the multitude of external actors with stakes in Sudan and the many processes that have led to endless forum shopping is most welcome. At the same time, success is far from guaranteed, given that both the SAF and the RSF have demonstrated no real appetite for peace, even as the war has fractured parts of Sudanese society and their own coalitions. But the alternative--simply letting Sudan collapse and threaten to take some of its fragile neighbors down with it--will never be the best choice.\n\nYet as diplomatic efforts to bring the belligerents to the table and stop the fighting continue, more decisive action is urgently needed on the humanitarian front. The Sudanese people cannot wait for their warring generals to find common ground--they need much more help now. It's impossible to know how many civilians have been killed, but what we do know is devastating: over ten million Sudanese people are displaced, over half of the population needs assistance to survive, and somewhere between three-quarters of a million and two and a half million people are at risk of starving to death in the months ahead, the result of deliberate choices on the part of the warring parties to make humanitarian access incredibly difficult.\n\nSequencing is always difficult in complex crises like Sudan's. But there is no time to spare when it comes to moving desperately needed assistance into the country. Adhering to the dictates of the SAF regarding which western border crossings can be used to move aid makes no sense--they have no actual control over the area, and no real legitimacy in the first place. There is no doubt that operating in the reality of Sudan today with a localized, patchwork approach that taps into informal, Sudanese civilian efforts carries real risks. But the risks of not trying are worse.

While the path to peace remains fraught with challenges, this initiative offers a ray of hope.\n\nIt represents a potential turning point, a chance to break the cycle of violence that has pushed Sudan into turmoil and despair.\n\nDespite the optimism, the deep-seated divisions between the warring factions underscore the difficulties ahead.\n\nAchieving a sustainable ceasefire and political resolution will require robust commitment and a spirit of compromise from all involved.", "source": {"uri": "riotimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Rio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rocco_caldero@riotimesonline.com", "name": "Rocco Caldero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sudanese Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://www.riotimesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2023-05-23T085827Z_915553373_RC2PP0AUPLHD_RTRMADP_3_SUDAN-POLITICS.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757355", "eventUri": "eng-9757355", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "textStart": 168, "textEnd": 177}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Both sides have been accused of war crimes.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel\n\nHere are the war's key players:\n\nTHE PROTAGONISTS: In 2021, Sudan's army chief Abdul Fattah Al Burhan seized power in a coup alongside his deputy, Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, known as Hemeti.\n\nThe pair pushed civilian politicians out of a power-sharing agreement set up after the 2019 overthrow of longtime dictator Omar Al Bashir.\n\nLess than two years later, on April 15, 2023, rivalry between the two erupted into full-fledged war, turning the capital Khartoum into a battleground.\n\nAlso read UAE contributes $25 million to UN for humanitarian efforts in Sudan UAE donates $8 million to WHO to support humanitarian efforts in Sudan UAE contributes $5m to United Nations OCHA for humanitarian efforts in Sudan UAE allocates 70% of its $100 million pledge to UN, its humanitarian agencies in Sudan\n\nFor decades, Sudanese leaders had used paramilitaries to fight wars in the country's far-flung regions - including Arab militias known as Janjaweed, which became the RSF in 2013.\n\nOn Bashir's orders, the Janjaweed mounted a scorched-earth campaign against non-Arab minorities suspected of supporting rebels in the western region of Darfur from 2003 which was widely regarded as genocide.\n\nINTERNAL POWERS: Besides the army and the paramilitaries, \"a third camp is increasingly significant in Darfur, made up of rebel groups aligned with neither Burhan nor Hemeti,\" according to Jalel Harchaoui, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\n\nSudan's many armed groups have adopted different strategies. Some, particularly in Darfur, have negotiated local truces between the army and RSF, while others have entered the fray in support of Burhan's troops.\n\nWithin months of the war breaking out, civilians began taking up arms in what the army has lauded as a \"popular resistance\" movement to defend against RSF advances.\n\nFormer prime minister Abdulla Hamdok, ousted by Burhan and Hemeti in 2021, now heads a bloc of political parties known as Taqadum, which the army accuses of being a front for the RSF.\n\nTaqadum politicians in turn claim some Islamists who held key positions in Bashir's ousted regime - their political enemies for decades - are using the army to regain power.\n\nFOREIGN INVOLVEMENT: Both sides have secured outside support from competing foreign interests.\n\nIn October 2023, the army pivoted towards Iran, which \"began supplying drones to Burhan\" helping him push back against RSF advances, Harchaoui said.\n\nRussia, which previously supported the RSF through its mercenary group Wagner, has recently switched sides.\n\nMoscow has for years had its sights on a Red Sea naval base near Port Sudan, the wartime headquarters of Burhan's administration, a deal that has recently been put back on the table.\n\nTurkey has also reportedly backed Burhan, while Saudi Arabia has along with the US played a mediator role.\n\nIn late May, deputy army chief Yassir Al Atta confirmed a \"military and economic collaboration\" with Russia would include \"the base, in exchange for the urgent supply of weapons and munitions\".", "source":

Both sides have been accused of war crimes.\n\nHere are the war's key players:\n\nIn 2021, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan seized power in a coup alongside his deputy, Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, known as Hemeti.\n\nThe pair pushed civilian politicians out of a power-sharing agreement set up after the 2019 overthrow of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.\n\nLess than two years later, on April 15, 2023, rivalry between the two erupted into full-fledged war, turning the capital Khartoum into a battleground.\n\nFor decades, Sudanese leaders had used paramilitaries to fight wars in the country's far-flung regions -- including Arab militias known as Janjaweed, which became the RSF in 2013.\n\nOn Bashir's orders, the Janjaweed mounted a scorched-earth campaign against non-Arab minorities suspected of supporting rebels in the western region of Darfur from 2003 which was widely regarded as genocide.\n\nBesides the army and the paramilitaries, \"a third camp is increasingly significant in Darfur, made up of rebel groups aligned with neither Burhan nor Hemeti,\" according to Jalel Harchaoui, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.\n\nSudan's many armed groups have adopted different strategies. Some, particularly in Darfur, have negotiated local truces between the army and RSF, while others have entered the fray in support of Burhan's troops.\n\nWithin months of the war breaking out, civilians began taking up arms in what the army has lauded as a \"popular resistance\" movement to defend against RSF advances.\n\nFormer prime minister Abdalla Hamdok, ousted by Burhan and Hemeti in 2021, now heads a bloc of political parties known as Taqadum, which the army accuses of being a front for the RSF.\n\nTaqadum politicians in turn claim some Islamists who held key positions in Bashir's ousted regime -- their political enemies for decades -- are using the army to regain power.\n\nBoth sides have secured outside support from competing foreign interests.\n\n\"From the start of the war, the United Arab Emirates has provided material, political, military and money-laundering support to the RSF,\" Harchaoui told AFP.\n\nIn a January report, a UN panel of experts tasked with monitoring an arms embargo on Darfur found \"credible\" accusations that the UAE was funnelling \"military support\" to the RSF through neighbouring Chad.\n\nAbu Dhabi has denied the allegations.\n\nChadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno has \"authorised logistical bases to support Hemeti,\" but faces resistance from within his own ethnic group, the Zaghawa, who are among the non-Arab minorities who have been targeted by the RSF in neighbouring Darfur, Harchaoui said.\n\nTo the north, the military strongman of eastern Libya, Khalifa Haftar, has facilitated \"generous deliveries\" of fuel and weapons to the RSF on behalf of Abu Dhabi, he added.\n\nEgypt, which is generally aligned with the UAE, has historically been the army's strongest backer. Though it cut back its support following a series of reverses for Burhan's troops last year, analysts say Cairo still wields significant influence.\n\nIn October 2023, the army pivoted towards Iran, which \"began supplying drones to Burhan\" helping him push back against RSF advances, Harchaoui said.\n\nRussia, which previously supported the RSF through its mercenary group Wagner, has recently switched sides too.\n\nMoscow has for years had its sights on a Red Sea naval base near Port Sudan, the wartime headquarters of Burhan's administration, a deal that has recently been put back on the table.\n\nTurkey has also reportedly backed Burhan, while Saudi Arabia has along with the US played a mediator role.", "source": {"uri": "standardmedia.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Standard

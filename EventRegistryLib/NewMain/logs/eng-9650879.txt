We now have multiple payment options in place for our customers to use and our Point of Sale business continues to grow and take more and more market share,\" said Ryan Hamlin, co-founder and CEO of POSaBIT.\n\nHamlin continued, \"Despite the reduction in top line revenue, this is offset by the decrease in cost of goods sold and the recognition of incoming cash from our licensing contracts, which puts us close to the same Gross Profit dollars we had prior to the recent payment interruptions. In fact, in March, our annualized Adjusted Gross Profit was approximately $10 million and Adjusted Revenue was $21 million, setting us up to exit the quarter profitably.\"\n\nAdjusted Revenue and Adjusted Gross Profit\n\nPOSaBIT believes it is important for investors to understand Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Gross Profit. POSaBIT's management team uses these metrics to measure the true cash available to operate the company. The Company defines Adjusted Revenue as gross revenue, minus license support revenue, plus actual licensing cash received as part of POSaBIT's licensing deals. The Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as Adjusted Revenue less company cost of goods sold.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $0.9 million compared to $1.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFinancial Results\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Revenue to Revenue, as reported.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted Gross Profit to Gross Profit, as reported.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Loss, as reported.\n\nRun Rate Guidance\n\nFor the month of March, POSaBIT generated Adjusted Revenue of ~$1.8 million and Adjusted Gross Profit of ~$0.8 million implying ~$21.6 million and ~$10 million of annualized Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Gross Profit, respectively. As we continue to execute on our business plan we expect these run rates to increase and will be updated as part of our quarterly earnings release.\n\nThe replay will be available approximately 1 hour after the completion of the live event.\n\nFull details of the financial and operating results are described in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the periods ended March 31, 2024 with accompanying notes. The consolidated financial statements and additional information about POSaBIT are available on the Company's website at www.posabit.com/investor-relations or on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nNon-IFRS Measures\n\nAdjusted Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures used by management that do not have any prescribed meaning by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company defines Adjusted Revenue as gross revenue, minus license support revenue, plus actual licensing cash received as part of POSaBIT's licensing deals. The Company defines Adjusted Gross Profit as Adjusted Revenue less company cost of goods sold. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss generated for the period as reported, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to remove changes in fair values and expected credit losses, foreign exchange gains and/or losses, impairments. The Company believes these non-IFRS measures are useful metrics to evaluate its core operating performance and uses these measures to provide shareholders and others with supplemental measures of its operating performance. The Company also believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, frequently use these non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of companies, many of which present similar metrics when reporting their results. We caution readers that Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are not substitutes for gross revenue, gross profit or profit/loss, respectively.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our business strategy, product development, timing of product development, events and courses of action. Statements which are not purely historical are forward-looking statements and include any statements regarding beliefs, plans, outlook, expectations or intentions regarding the future including words or phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"objective,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"plan,\" \"is designed to\" or similar expressions suggesting future outcomes or the negative thereof or similar variations. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, statements about: our expectations regarding margin improvements and annualized Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Gross Profit; our future growth strategy and growth rate; our future intellectual property; and our anticipated trends and challenges in the markets in which we operate. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which POSaBIT will operate in the future, including the demand for our products, anticipated costs and ability to achieve goals. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying these statements are reasonable, they may prove to be incorrect. Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, you should not unduly rely on these forward-looking statements.\n\nForward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, business, economic and capital market conditions; the ability to manage our operating expenses, which may adversely affect our financial condition; our ability to remain competitive as other better financed competitors develop and release competitive products; regulatory uncertainties; market conditions and the demand and pricing for our products; our relationships with our customers, distributors and business partners; our ability to successfully define, design and release new products in a timely manner that meet our customers' needs; our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; competition in our industry; our ability to maintain technological leadership; our ability to manage risks inherent in foreign operations; the impact of technology changes on our products and industry; our failure to develop new and innovative products; our ability to successfully maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights and defend third-party claims of infringement of their intellectual property rights; the impact of intellectual property litigation that could materially and adversely affect our business; our ability to manage working capital; and our dependence on key personnel. POSaBIT is an early-stage company with a short operating history; it may not achieve profitability; and it may not actually achieve its plans, projections, or expectations.\n\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from POSaBIT's expectations include consumer sentiment towards POSaBIT's products, litigation, global economic climate, loss of key employees and consultants, additional funding requirements, changes in laws, technology failures, competition, and failure of counterparties to perform their contractual obligations.\n\nNeither we nor any of our representatives make any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy, sufficiency or completeness of the information in this news release.

Finally, we've executed on our stated commitments with discipline and speed, enabling us to exceed our earnings guidance and accelerate our cost savings program, setting us up well for continued margin expansion and strong cash generation ahead.\"\n\nFOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY\n\nFiscal Year 2024 was a transition year for Wiley as the Company divested non-core assets, restructured and realigned the organization, and recorded multiple non-cash impairments. Results reflect this activity.\n\nGAAP Results (including Held for Sale or Sold Assets): Revenue of $468 million (-11%), Operating income of $69 million (-17%), and EPS of $0.46 (-$0.76).Adjusted Results at Constant Currency (excluding Held for Sale or Sold Assets): Revenue of $441 million (+4%), Adjusted EBITDA of $125 million (+7%), and Adjusted EPS of $1.21 (+2%).\n\nFULL YEAR SUMMARY\n\nGAAP Results: Revenue of $1,873 million (-7%), Operating income of $52 million (-6%), and EPS loss of $3.65 (-$3.96).Adjusted Results at Constant Currency: Revenue of $1,617 million (-1%), Adjusted EBITDA of $369 million (-3%), and Adjusted EPS of $2.78 (-19%).Cash from Operations of $208 million (-$69 million) and Free Cash Flow of $114 million (-$59 million) mainly due to lower cash earnings and higher restructuring payments.\n\nFor GAAP purposes, Wiley's reporting structure consists of three segments: (1) Research, (2) Learning, and (3) Held for Sale or Sold. Adjusted numbers exclude our Held for Sale or Sold reporting segment, as well as restructuring costs and other unusual items. See the reconciliation provided in the tables that follow.\n\nResearch\n\nFourth Quarter Revenue of $271 million was down 3% as reported and at constant currency, mainly due to timing and declines in ancillary print and licensing revenue in Research Publishing, and soft market conditions in advertising and recruiting in Research Solutions. Full Year Revenue of $1,043 million was down 3% as reported, or 4% at constant currency, mainly due to the full year Hindawi impact. Excluding Hindawi, Research revenue for the year was flat.Fourth Quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $94 million was down 11% as reported and 12% at constant currency due to lower revenue and lower incentive compensation costs in the prior year due to underperformance. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 34.6%. Full Year Adjusted EBITDA of $331 million was down 13% at constant currency mainly driven by revenue performance and the incentive compensation swing. Excluding Hindawi, Research Adjusted EBITDA for the year was down 4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year was 31.8%.\n\nLearning\n\nFourth Quarter Revenue of $170 million was up 18% as reported and at constant currency driven by a $23 million content rights project for training GenAI large language models and continued growth in Academic content and courseware. Excluding the one-time GenAI project, Q4 Learning revenue rose 2% on a constant currency basis. Full Year Revenue of $574 million was up 5% as reported and at constant currency due to outperformance in digital content and courseware in Academic and the GenAI content rights project in both Academic and Professional. Excluding the one-time project, full year Learning revenue rose 1% on a constant currency basis.Fourth Quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $74 million was up 54% as reported and at constant currency due to the GenAI content rights project and restructuring savings. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 43.5% compared to 33.5% in the prior year period. Full Year Adjusted EBITDA of $200 million was up 27% at constant currency mainly due to revenue performance and restructuring savings. Full Year Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.9% compared to 28.9% in the prior year period.\n\nCorporate Expense Category\n\nFourth Quarter Adjusted Corporate Expenses of $43 million on an Adjusted EBITDA basis was up 15% over prior year at constant currency, driven by higher professional fees. Full Year Adjusted Corporate Expenses of $163 million was up 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation.\n\nBusinesses Held for Sale or Sold (HFS)\n\nOur Held for Sale or Sold segment reflects the performance of those businesses for the periods owned. Wiley University Services was sold on January 1, 2024. The sale of Wiley Edge, with the exception of its India operation, was completed on May 31, 2024. The sale of Wiley Edge's India operation will be finalized later in calendar year 2024. See accompanying financial tables for Q4 and FY24 performance.\n\nEPS\n\nFourth Quarter GAAP EPS of $0.46 compared to $1.22 in the prior year period primarily due to a valuation allowance on US deferred tax assets, restructuring charges, and a net increase in the loss on the sale of University Services. Fourth Quarter Adjusted EPS of $1.21 was up 2% at constant currency due to revenue performance partially offset by tech write-offs as part of our legacy decommissioning.Full Year GAAP EPS loss of $3.65 compared to +$0.31 in the prior year period primarily due to non-cash impairments related to held for sale or sold assets and losses on sale, as well as higher restructuring charges. Full Year Adjusted EPS of $2.78 was down 19% impacted by lower Adjusted Operating Income, higher interest and tax expense, and higher pension expense.\n\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow, and Capital Allocation\n\nNet Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio (Trailing Twelve Months) at quarter end was 1.7 compared to 1.5 in the year-ago period.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (full year) was $208 million compared to $277 million in the prior year period due to lower cash earnings and higher restructuring payments.Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending (full year) was $114 million compared to $173 million in the prior year period due to lower cash provided by operating activities and higher restructuring and interest payments partially offset by lower Capex. Capex of $93 million was below prior year by $11 million. Note, Wiley does not provide an adjusted Free Cash Flow metric; results include held for sale or sold businesses.Returns to Shareholders (full year): Wiley allocated $122 million toward dividends and share repurchases, up from $112 million in the prior year, with $45 million used to acquire 1.3 million shares at an average cost per share of $34.71. This compares to 832,000 shares repurchased in the prior year period. In June 2023, Wiley raised its dividend for the 30 th consecutive year.\n\nFISCAL YEAR 2025 OUTLOOK\n\nMetric\n\n( $millions, except EPS)\n\nFiscal 2024 Results\n\nEx-Divestitures\n\nFiscal 2025 Outlook\n\nEx-Divestitures\n\nAdj.

See the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and explanations of the uses of non-GAAP measures in the supplementary information. We have not provided our 2025 outlook for the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to certain items, including restructuring charges and credits, gains and losses on foreign currency, and other gains and losses.

(2) All amounts are approximate due to rounding. (3) As previously announced, we are divesting non-core businesses, including University Services, Wiley Edge, and CrossKnowledge. These three businesses met the held-for-sale criteria starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. We measured each disposal group at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell prior to its disposition. On January 1, 2024 we completed the sale of University Services. On January 8, 2024 we entered into an agreement to sell our Wiley Edge business, which closed on May 31, 2024, with the exception of its India operations. The sale of Wiley Edge's India operation will be finalized later in calendar year 2024. We expect to complete the sale of CrossKnowledge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\nAs a result, we reorganized our segments in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, and our new structure consists of three reportable segments which includes Research (no change), Learning, and Held for Sale or Sold, as well as a Corporate expense category (no change). As a result of this realignment, we were required to test goodwill for impairment immediately before and after the realignment. Prior to the realignment, we concluded that the fair value of the University Services reporting unit within the Held for Sale or Sold segment was below its carrying value which resulted in a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of $11.4 million in the year ended April 30, 2024. After the realignment, we concluded that the fair value of the CrossKnowledge reporting unit within the Held for Sale or Sold segment was below its carrying value which resulted in a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of $15.3 million in the year ended April 30, 2024.\n\nAs a result of signing an agreement to sell Wiley Edge and the decrease in the fair value of the business which was impacted by a decline in placements in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we tested the goodwill of the Wiley Edge reporting unit within the Held for Sale or Sold segment for impairment. We concluded that the carrying value of the reporting unit was above its fair value which resulted in a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of $81.7 million in the year ended April 30, 2024.\n\nIn the three months ended April 30, 2024, there was an increase in the pretax loss on the sale of University Services after the closing of approximately $5.6 million, which resulted in a total pretax loss of $107.0 million (net of tax loss of $80.5 million) in the year ended April 30, 2024. We also completed the sale of our Tuition Manager business previously in our Held for Sale or Sold segment, which resulted in a total net pretax loss of $1.5 million (net of tax loss of $1.1 million) in the year ended April 30, 2024.\n\nWiley Edge and CrossKnowledge continue to be reported as held-for-sale. We recorded a held-for-sale pretax impairment release of $2.0 million and charges of $74.8 million in the three months and year ended April 30, 2024, respectively, related to Wiley Edge and CrossKnowledge. The total impairment charge for Wiley Edge in the year ended April 30, 2024 was $19.4 million, which includes a release of $1.2 million in the three months ended April 30, 2024. The total impairment charge for CrossKnowledge in the year ended April 30, 2024 was $55.4 million, which includes a release of $0.8 million in the three months ended April 30, 2024. (4) In calculating diluted net loss per common share for the year ended April 30, 2024, our diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding excludes the effect of unvested restricted stock units and other stock awards as the effect was antidilutive. This occurs when a US GAAP net loss is reported and the effect of using dilutive shares is antidilutive.

The supplementary information included in this press release for the three months and year ended April 30, 2024 is preliminary and subject to change prior to the filing of our upcoming Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (2) All amounts are approximate due to rounding. (3) In the three months ended January 31, 2023, we settled a litigation matter related to consideration for a previous acquisition for $3.7 million. (4) In fiscal year 2023 due to the closure of our operations in Russia, the Russia entity was deemed substantially liquidated. In the three months and year ended April 30, 2024, we wrote off an additional $0.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of cumulative translation adjustments in earnings. In the three months and year ended April 30, 2023, we wrote off $1.1 million of cumulative translation adjustments in earnings. This amount is reflected in Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income (Loss). In addition, in the three months and year ended April 30, 2023, there was a curtailment and settlement credit due to the wind up of the Russia Pension Plan of $1.8 million which is reflected in Other (expense) income, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income (Loss). (5) Reflects the amortization of intangible assets established on the opening balance sheet for an acquired business. This includes the amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships, tradenames, etc., which is reflected in the \"Amortization of intangible assets\" line in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income (Loss). It also includes the amortization of acquired product development assets, which is reflected in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income (Loss). (6) We are divesting non-core businesses, including University Services, Wiley Edge, and CrossKnowledge. On January 1, 2024 we completed the sale of University Services. Wiley Edge and CrossKnowledge continue to be reported as held-for-sale, and we measured each business at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. The total impairment charge for Wiley Edge in the year ended April 30, 2024 was $19.4 million, which includes a release of $1.2 million in the three months ended April 30, 2024. The total impairment charge for CrossKnowledge in the year ended April 30, 2024 was $55.4 million, which includes a release of $0.8 million in the three months ended April 30, 2024.\n\nIn the three months ended April 30, 2024, there was an increase in the pretax loss on the sale of University Services after the closing of approximately $5.6 million, which resulted in a total pretax loss of $107.0 million (net of tax loss of $80.5 million) in the year ended April 30, 2024. We also completed the sale of our Tuition Manager business previously in our Held for Sale or Sold segment, which resulted in a total net pretax loss of $1.5 million (net of tax loss of $1.1 million) in the year ended April 30, 2024.\n\nIn addition, our Adjusted EPS excludes the Adjusted Net Income of our Held for Sale or Sold segment. (7) Represents the impact of using diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding (55.7 million for the year ended April 30, 2024) included in the Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS calculation in order to apply the dilutive impact on adjusted net income due to the effect of unvested restricted stock units and other stock awards. This impact occurs when a US GAAP net loss is reported and the effect of using dilutive shares is antidilutive. (8) For the three months and year ended April 30, 2024 substantially all of the tax impact was from deferred taxes. For the three months ended April 30, 2023, the tax impact was $4.3 million of current tax benefit and $0.1 million of deferred taxes. For the year ended April 30, 2023, substantially all of the tax impact was from deferred taxes. (9) In the three months ended July 31, 2021, the UK enacted legislation that increased its statutory rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. For the three months and year ended April 30, 2023, we recorded a $2.4 million noncash deferred tax benefit related to pensions due to the UK statutory rate change. These adjustments impacted deferred taxes. (10) In fiscal year 2024, due to temporary differences in the US, our deferred taxes reversed from a deferred tax liability position to a deferred tax asset position. Due to losses in the US resulting from impairments, restructuring, and acceleration of depreciation expense on capitalized software, we concluded it was more-likely-than-not that all or a portion of our deferred tax asset may not be realized. As a result, we increased the valuation allowance by $30.2 million.

(3) See Explanation of Usage of Non-GAAP Performance Measures included in this supplemental information.\n\nJOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\n\nEXPLANATION OF USAGE OF NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES In this earnings release and supplemental information, management may present the following non-GAAP performance measures: Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS);Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending;Adjusted Revenue;Adjusted Operating Income and margin;Adjusted Income Before Taxes;Adjusted Income Tax Provision;Adjusted Effective Tax Rate;EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and margin;Organic revenue; andResults on a constant currency basis.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP performance measures as supplemental indicators of our operating performance and financial position as well as for internal reporting and forecasting purposes, when publicly providing our outlook, to evaluate our performance and calculate incentive compensation. We present these non-GAAP performance measures in addition to US GAAP financial results because we believe that these non-GAAP performance measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for operational trends and comparisons over time. The use of these non-GAAP performance measures may also provide a consistent basis to evaluate operating profitability and performance trends by excluding items that we do not consider to be controllable activities for this purpose. The performance metric used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments is Adjusted Operating Income. We present both Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA for each of our reportable segments as we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides additional useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for operational trends and comparisons over time. It removes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, as well as presents a consistent basis to evaluate operating profitability and compare our financial performance to that of our peer companies and competitors. For example:Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Income Before Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted EBITDA, and organic revenue (excluding acquisitions) provide a more comparable basis to analyze operating results and earnings and are measures commonly used by shareholders to measure our performance.Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending helps assess our ability, over the long term, to create value for our shareholders as it represents cash available to repay debt, pay common stock dividends, and fund share repurchases and acquisitions.Results on a constant currency basis remove distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements to provide better comparability of our business trends from period to period. We measure our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency (or at constant currency), which means that we apply the same foreign currency exchange rates for the current and equivalent prior period.In addition, we have historically provided these or similar non-GAAP performance measures and understand that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our operating margins and net income, and in comparing our financial performance to that of our peer companies and competitors. Based on interactions with investors, we also believe that our non-GAAP performance measures are regarded as useful to our investors as supplemental to our US GAAP financial results, and that there is no confusion regarding the adjustments or our operating performance to our investors due to the comprehensive nature of our disclosures. We have not provided our 2025 outlook for the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measures, as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to certain items, including restructuring charges and credits, gains and losses on foreign currency, and other gains and losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our consolidated results computed in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP performance measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by US GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures used by other companies and should not be viewed as alternatives to measures of financial results under US GAAP. The adjusted metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, US GAAP information. It does not purport to represent any similarly titled US GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial metrics that we present may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by others. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240613737152/en/\n\nCONTACT:

On top of this, we're seeing significant interest in leveraging our authoritative content to train AI and machine learning models. Finally, we've executed on our stated commitments with discipline and speed, enabling us to exceed our earnings guidance and accelerate our cost savings program, setting us up well for continued margin expansion and strong cash generation ahead.\"\n\nFOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY\n\nFiscal Year 2024 was a transition year for Wiley as the Company divested non-core assets, restructured and realigned the organization, and recorded multiple non-cash impairments. Results reflect this activity.\n\nGAAP Results (including Held for Sale or Sold Assets): Revenue of $468 million (-11%), Operating income of $69 million (-17%), and EPS of $0.46 (-$0.76). Adjusted Results at Constant Currency (excluding Held for Sale or Sold Assets): Revenue of $441 million (+4%), Adjusted EBITDA of $125 million (+7%), and Adjusted EPS of $1.21 (+2%).\n\nFULL YEAR SUMMARY\n\nGAAP Results: Revenue of $1,873 million (-7%), Operating income of $52 million (-6%), and EPS loss of $3.65 (-$3.96). Adjusted Results at Constant Currency: Revenue of $1,617 million (-1%), Adjusted EBITDA of $369 million (-3%), and Adjusted EPS of $2.78 (-19%). Cash from Operations of $208 million (-$69 million) and Free Cash Flow of $114 million (-$59 million) mainly due to lower cash earnings and higher restructuring payments.\n\nFor GAAP purposes, Wiley's reporting structure consists of three segments: (1) Research, (2) Learning, and (3) Held for Sale or Sold. Adjusted numbers exclude our Held for Sale or Sold reporting segment, as well as restructuring costs and other unusual items. See the reconciliation provided in the tables that follow.\n\nResearch\n\nFourth Quarter Revenue of $271 million was down 3% as reported and at constant currency, mainly due to timing and declines in ancillary print and licensing revenue in Research Publishing, and soft market conditions in advertising and recruiting in Research Solutions. Full Year Revenue of $1,043 million was down 3% as reported, or 4% at constant currency, mainly due to the full year Hindawi impact. Excluding Hindawi, Research revenue for the year was flat. Fourth Quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $94 million was down 11% as reported and 12% at constant currency due to lower revenue and lower incentive compensation costs in the prior year due to underperformance. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 34.6%. Full Year Adjusted EBITDA of $331 million was down 13% at constant currency mainly driven by revenue performance and the incentive compensation swing. Excluding Hindawi, Research Adjusted EBITDA for the year was down 4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year was 31.8%.\n\nLearning\n\nFourth Quarter Revenue of $170 million was up 18% as reported and at constant currency driven by a $23 million content rights project for training GenAI large language models and continued growth in Academic content and courseware. Excluding the one-time GenAI project, Q4 Learning revenue rose 2% on a constant currency basis. Full Year Revenue of $574 million was up 5% as reported and at constant currency due to outperformance in digital content and courseware in Academic and the GenAI content rights project in both Academic and Professional. Excluding the one-time project, full year Learning revenue rose 1% on a constant currency basis. Fourth Quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $74 million was up 54% as reported and at constant currency due to the GenAI content rights project and restructuring savings. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 43.5% compared to 33.5% in the prior year period. Full Year Adjusted EBITDA of $200 million was up 27% at constant currency mainly due to revenue performance and restructuring savings. Full Year Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.9% compared to 28.9% in the prior year period.\n\nCorporate Expense Category\n\nFourth Quarter Adjusted Corporate Expenses of $43 million on an Adjusted EBITDA basis was up 15% over prior year at constant currency, driven by higher professional fees. Full Year Adjusted Corporate Expenses of $163 million was up 4% primarily due to higher incentive compensation.\n\nBusinesses Held for Sale or Sold (HFS)\n\nOur Held for Sale or Sold segment reflects the performance of those businesses for the periods owned. Wiley University Services was sold on January 1, 2024. The sale of Wiley Edge, with the exception of its India operation, was completed on May 31, 2024. The sale of Wiley Edge's India operation will be finalized later in calendar year 2024. See accompanying financial tables for Q4 and FY24 performance.\n\nEPS\n\nFourth Quarter GAAP EPS of $0.46 compared to $1.22 in the prior year period primarily due to a valuation allowance on US deferred tax assets, restructuring charges, and a net increase in the loss on the sale of University Services. Fourth Quarter Adjusted EPS of $1.21 was up 2% at constant currency due to revenue performance partially offset by tech write-offs as part of our legacy decommissioning. Full Year GAAP EPS loss of $3.65 compared to +$0.31 in the prior year period primarily due to non-cash impairments related to held for sale or sold assets and losses on sale, as well as higher restructuring charges. Full Year Adjusted EPS of $2.78 was down 19% impacted by lower Adjusted Operating Income, higher interest and tax expense, and higher pension expense.\n\nBalance Sheet, Cash Flow, and Capital Allocation\n\nNet Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio (Trailing Twelve Months) at quarter end was 1.7 compared to 1.5 in the year-ago period. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (full year) was $208 million compared to $277 million in the prior year period due to lower cash earnings and higher restructuring payments. Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending (full year) was $114 million compared to $173 million in the prior year period due to lower cash provided by operating activities and higher restructuring and interest payments partially offset by lower Capex. Capex of $93 million was below prior year by $11 million. Note, Wiley does not provide an adjusted Free Cash Flow metric; results include held for sale or sold businesses. Returns to Shareholders (full year): Wiley allocated $122 million toward dividends and share repurchases, up from $112 million in the prior year, with $45 million used to acquire 1.3 million shares at an average cost per share of $34.71.

Research is entering FY25 with strong leading indicators, including 15% submissions growth and mid-single digit output growth in Q4. Adjusted EBITDA - margin expansion outlook in line with previous targets driven by revenue growth and cost savings while reflecting reinvestments to scale and optimize Research, modernize infrastructure and expand GenAI content licensing, capabilities, and product development. Adjusted EPS - significant growth expectation driven by higher expected Adjusted Operating Income and accrued interest income from divestitures offsetting higher interest and tax expense. Free Cash Flow - growth outlook driven by lower restructuring payments and favorable working capital partially offset by higher capex and year-over-year swing in incentive compensation payments. The Company expects capex of $130 million compared to $93 million in Fiscal 2024 driven by the acceleration of its Research Publishing platform work and infrastructure modernization.\n\nThe Company remains on track with its Fiscal 2026 targets.\n\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\n\nScheduled for today, June 13 at 10:00 am (ET).

Results reflect this activity.\n\nFULL YEAR SUMMARY\n\nFor GAAP purposes, Wiley's reporting structure consists of three segments: (1) Research, (2) Learning, and (3) Held for Sale or Sold. Adjusted numbers exclude our Held for Sale or Sold reporting segment, as well as restructuring costs and other unusual items. See the reconciliation provided in the tables that follow.\n\nOur Held for Sale or Sold segment reflects the performance of those businesses for the periods owned. Wiley University Services was sold on January 1, 2024. The sale of Wiley Edge, with the exception of its India operation, was completed on May 31, 2024. The sale of Wiley Edge's India operation will be finalized later in calendar year 2024. See accompanying financial tables for Q4 and FY24 performance.\n\nScheduled for today, June 13 at 10:00 am (ET).

Management believes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring charges and credits and certain other items, and the impact of divestitures and acquisitions provide a useful comparable basis to analyze operating results and earnings. See the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and explanations of the uses of non-GAAP measures in the supplementary information. We have not provided our 2025 outlook for the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to certain items, including restructuring charges and credits, gains and losses on foreign currency, and other gains and losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our consolidated results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning the Company's operations, performance, and financial condition.

{"id": 231259048, "title": "Inside Scottie Scheffler's conversation with clueless cops - including absurd Tiger Woods question - as new footage of World No. 1's arrest emerges", "text": "Clueless Louisville cops can be heard asking Scottie Scheffler how good he is at golf - and later realizing he's the current World No. 1 - in remarkable new footage from his arrest at Valhalla last month. Scheffler was arrested while making his way into Valhalla Golf Club for his second round at the PGA Championship, before being booked into jail on four criminal charges - including second-degree assault of a police officer. Amid a traffic pileup outside the club - following a fatal accident earlier that morning - the two-time Masters champion was accused of ignoring police orders to pull over his vehicle and instead speeding away, which dragged Louisville Detective Bryan Gillis to the ground and left him with both minor cuts and torn pants. All charges against him were eventually dropped, with Scheffler even considering taking legal action himself after his claim that the incident was simply one big misunderstanding was said to be 'corroborated by the evidence'. Yet just over three weeks on from that astonishing morning at Valhalla, Louisville police has released more footage of the arrest. The bodycam video, which runs for close to 1h30mins, shows the moment Scheffler was put in handcuffs by Gillis after allegedly dragging the Detective to the ground. 'I'm just trying to get to my tee time,' the golf star says in bemusement. 'I'm shaking. 'Damn... I'm about to get arrested. I'm just trying to get to my tee time!' As he's led away by Gillis, Scheffler appears to ask a member of the public: 'Can you please help me?' Another clip from inside the police car then shows the remarkable exchange between Scheffler and another officer helping escort him to jail. After being grilled on whether he's had anything to drink that morning, the golfer jokes: 'I try not to drink too much before I play golf at 8am...' The cop then asks: 'So I assume you're pretty good if you're playing in the PGA?' 'I'm alright, yeah,' Scheffler modestly replies. The officer follows that by asking: 'Is Tiger [Woods] as good as they say he is?' before Scheffler appears to confirm as much. Scheffler can also be seen reading a notification reporting the delay of the second round of the PGA Championship, which he eventually made later that day. The same cop is later heard enquiring further about his golf career, including questions on how long he's been playing the sport and how old he is now. 'You're 27 and you're freaking playing in the PGA?' he says in astonishment. Scheffler then tells him that he had his first child the week prior, before the officer congratulates him. At one stage in the video, the World No. 1 rates his chances of playing at the PGA Championship that day at 'one per cent'. It also includes blurred footage of Scheffler sat inside a police cell, where the officer admits: 'I didn't know you was the number one in the world right now. That's why all the news was there.' He then tells one of his colleagues: 'He's the number one player in the world!' 'Who?' the other cop asks as his fellow officer then points him out. 'You're too casual to be the number one player in the world,' Scheffler is then told. 'You should have had a driver!' After an officer predicts that he will 'be alright', Scheffler says: 'I appreciate y'all chatting with me, I was sitting here and I could not stop shaking. That's why I asked you to come in, because I needed to calm down.' At the end of the clip another cop asks him to confirm his surname before saying: 'Oh yeah, I saw you on the news this morning.' Before the latest bodycam footage emerged, Louisville police also released photos of Detective Gillis' minor injuries and torn pants. Small cuts can be seen on Gillis' knee and wrist, while his $80 pants are also ripped as he claimed in his police citation. However, fans quickly took to social media to claim his injuries were not serious enough to warrant the drama which played out that morning at Valhalla. One sarcastically wrote: 'Could you please provide a content warning when posting such graphic images?' Another joked: 'Damn, I hope he makes a full recovery.....' A third put: 'I\u2019ve seen worse from my 10 year old falling off his bicycle'. While a fourth asked about the torn pants: 'That\u2019s \u201cdestroyed beyond repair\u201d?' Gillis released a statement praising Scheffler after all charges against him were dropped last week, while also paying respect to the family of John Mills - the 69-year-old who was struck by a bus and killed outside Valhalla earlier that morning. 'A tragic incident occurred, and the family of Mr. Mills remains in my family's thoughts and prayers,' he said about the fatal collision, which caused the traffic pile-up that led to Scheffler's arrest. 'This was a chaotic situation for everyone involved. Ensuring the safety of everyone in the vicinity was my utmost priority. 'Mr. Scheffler and I both agree that there will be no ill will over this going forward. Instead of giving a negative public reaction, he chose to speak with dignity, humility and respect. My family and I appreciate that.", "summary": "Scheffler was arrested while making his way into Valhalla Golf Club for his second round at the PGA Championship last month, before being booked into jail on four criminal charges.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-13508749/scottie-scheffler-arrest-police-footage-tiger-woods.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/13/85872667-0-image-m-7_1717850342296.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:56:23", "author": "Editor,Tom Huddlestone", "authors": ["Editor", "Tom Huddlestone"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.483}

{"id": 231543630, "title": "Former NBA coach Don Casey recalls magical run with Boston Celtics", "text": "As the Boston Celtics rumble along in the NBA Finals, Don Casey merely needs to step into his backyard to be reminded of his days coaching with the storied franchise. One peek at the pool transports him back. Casey's wife yearned for a spot to cool off on warm summer days and Robert Parish, Ed Pinckney and Joe Kleine helped make it happen. \"They gave her a 'playoff bonus' out of their playoff money,\" Casey said. Casey, a former San Diego Clippers assistant who later became head coach after the franchise bolted for Los Angeles, joined the staff of Chris Ford in Boston during one of the most meaningful chapters in Celtics history. He was there for the stretch run of iconic superstars Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Parish. When the Clippers fired Casey, he received an assist from a San Diego sports icon. Casey used to meet Bill Walton for meals at D.Z. Akin's while his former player was rehabbing after a knee injury. Walton called up Bird to put in a good word. \"The first time I met Bird, he walks into practice, looks me in the face and says, 'Walton says you're a pretty good coach,' \" said Casey, 86, who lives in the Fletcher Hills area near Grossmont College. \"Then he says, 'We'll see' and just walked away. \"That was my first interaction.\" Casey soaked it all up \u2014 the star power, the parquet floor, the creaky bones of the Boston Garden and late cigar-chomping coach turned team executive Red Auerbach. It was a franchise unlike any other at a time unlike any other. The coaches knew there was no blueprint for how to handle the special group. Scrimmages were capped at seven baskets because the elite winners were so competitive that anything more pushed the needle into the red. \"We had to do that because it was so high-strung,\" Casey said. \"All those guys, plus Klein, Dee Brown, Reggie Lewis, (Kevin) Gamble, Brian Shaw, it was a war.\" No flame fanning necessary. \"Bird was very intense. He was the alpha dog,\" Casey said. \"When those guys stepped across the white line, that was it.\" Auerbach also was a curious cog. As coaches tried to conduct a film session, Auerbach was confused. When an explanation arrived, he showed that the concept was beyond foreign to him. \"Red said, 'What's a VCR?' \" Casey said. \"He had a meeting with coaches, 'I don't like this tape stuff. I don't like my players' minds boggled.' So we could only do a highlight tape for shootarounds that was like 3 1/2 minutes long. Red only wanted us to show the good things they did: 'Don't make them look bad.'\" There was a kinder side to the cantankerous front office man, too. Casey and his wife sometimes drove Auerbach around because not many were willing to brave such an assignment. When the coach's wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, Auerbach and team CEO Dave Gavitt rushed into action. They lined up the best doctors and locked down appointments. \"One time Red was in the hospital, so we went to see him,\" Casey said with a grin. \"The nurse at the nurse's station called the room and said, 'Mr. Auerbach there's a Coach Casey here to see you.' Red said, 'Is his wife here?' When the nurse said yes, he said, 'OK, send them back.' \" The dusty Boston Garden offered another glimpse of Auerbach. There was a large cat that lived at the famed sports venue and Auerbach said it kept the rodent population under control. In a chance conversation, Auerbach asked Casey a question. \"Have you seen 'No Cut' today?' \" Casey said. \"He named the cat 'No Cut' because it never got cut from the team.\" Though Casey became head coach of the Clippers and later the Nets, it's clear that his time with the Celtics was unforgettable. In his home office hangs a Larry Bird-signed photo of the star taking a jump shot with Casey on the bench in the background. The owners added a makeshift thought bubble over the Nets-bound Casey, \"Yeah, he's good ... but he's no Keith Van Horn!\" in reference to the promising player for that franchise. Below the Bird photo is a framed front page of the New York Post with a photo of Casey with a hand on his head in frustration. The headline: \"Basket Casey ... Same old Nets drive new coach nuts in horrific loss to Raptors.\" \"We were getting killed,\" he said. That rarely happened with the Celtics, an unforgettable bunch. Casey pulled a green and white ball off a bookcase that had been signed by the whole team. Players used to sit in a row on a bench and pass items down the line to sign. \"Bird would sign 'Pete Rose' on things, so (coach) Chris Ford had to sit right beside him,\" Casey said. Casey eventually found his rhythm in Boston. \"We were doing drills and I had the big guys,\" he said. \"The first guy in line was 'Chief' (Parish). He started the drill. They've got three championships and I'm the guy who just got fired by the Clippers. \"They were like sponges. I said to myself, 'This is going to be OK.' \" And the warm El Cajon days are OK, too, thanks to that pool.", "summary": "El Cajon resident had a front-row seat for the stretch run of iconic careers and memorable executive Red Auerbach", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/sports-columnists/story/2024-06-08/don-casey-nba-coach-boston-celtics-bird-mchale-parish", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7cfea46/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3004x1577+0+439/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc2%2Fc2%2Fdeea4b494f4493c75b18a214300d%2Fcasey.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:27:56", "author": "Bryce Miller", "authors": ["Bryce Miller"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.167}

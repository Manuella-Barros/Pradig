And goalkeeper Pickford produced a faultless performance.\n\nCalvert-Lewin was a thorn throughout from the moment he was denied an early penalty by an offside decision when he was brought down by Liverpool keeper Alisson.\n\nEverton were superbly drilled in defence and even had opportunities to add to their tally - but nothing could dilute the wild celebrations at the end as supporters revelled in the victory and in Liverpool's misery.\n\nIt was a performance that did beg one question: Where has this Everton been for large parts of this season?\n\nEverton fans did not care in this night, however, as they danced down Goodison Road in celebration.\n\nIs Liverpool's title chance gone?\n\nLiverpool's players trooped off with heads bowed at the final whistle, some nursing grievances with the officials, but the frustration was surely more the knowledge that this might be a decisive night in their title challenge.\n\nThey cannot be written off, of course, but Liverpool suddenly look like a side out of energy and ideas, with even the normally reliable Mohamed Salah misfiring all night.\n\nIt made for a miserable derby farewell for manager Jurgen Klopp, who says it is never easy at Goodison Park -- and it has never been tougher than this.\n\nLiverpool are now three points behind leaders Arsenal, but the Gunners have a vastly superior goal difference, which is like the cushion of an extra point.\n\nIt felt like Liverpool had walked into a trap at Goodison Park as Everton turned on the power to rattle their arch rivals in a manner rarely seen in these fixtures in recent years. Liverpool had their chances, but Everton would not be moved.\n\nOn nights like this, and when Everton actually responds to the atmosphere, Goodison Park is a very unforgiving environment, and Liverpool came up short in too many areas.\n\nJurgen Klopp and Liverpool have defied the odds before, but the manner in which they played, and in which they made their retreat at the final whistle, made it clear what damage this defeat has done.", "source": {"uri": "newmail-ng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Mail Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrissa_Gueye", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Idrissa Gueye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Smokeless", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Smokeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://newmail-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Everton-win-to-hit-Liverpool-title-hopes.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-10-", "textStart": 403, "textEnd": 415}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

(Photo by Tony McArdle/Everton FC via Getty Images).\n\nLiverpool's Premier League title hopes were dealt a potentially fatal blow as they slumped to a 2-0 defeat to city rivals Everton in an exhilarating Merseyside derby.\n\nFresh and ready for the challenge. It will take a total squad effort against Everton and then at West Ham on Saturday if Liverpool are going to win both to really put the pressure on Arsenal and Manchester City in the title race. The bad news is they Diogo Jota is out injured again as he will miss the next two weeks.\n\nJurgen Klopp's final Merseyside derby as Liverpool boss was a flop, as Everton beat the Reds 2-0 on goals from Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Jarrad Branthwaite at Goodison Park.\n\nIt's Everton's first home Merseyside derby win in 13.5 years dating back to October 2010.\n\nThe 244th edition saw Everton burst out of the gates and take a deserved lead, then weather Liverpool's storm long enough for Calvert-Lewin to capitalize off a set piece and give the Toffees table relief.\n\nEverton deliver a big win for manager Sean Dyche and the club writ large, moving onto 33 points and 16th place. The back-to-back wins, a rarity this season, boost the Toffees eight points clear of 18th-place Luton Town.\n\nIt's a double bonus for Everton that they strike a massive blow to Liverpool's Premier League title hopes. The Reds exit Goodison with 74 points in 34 games, three points behind leaders Arsenal. Manchester City have 73 points and have two matches-in-hand, the first coming Thursday versus Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nEverton supporters have been waiting more than a decade for this, and their second win over Liverpool in 30 tries is thick with meaning.\n\nThe Toffees have twice been dealt points deductions this season, and are basically safe now. It will mean even more to Sean Dyche's men that they managed the feat while denting Liverpool's title hopes, as their despised rivals had timed their incredible Premier League run with some of the worst seasons in Everton history.\n\nWhatever awaits Sean Dyche next, this will leave the Toffees boss feeling accomplished. It's been a terrible season around Goodison Park, but he's delivered something unexperienced by any adolescent Everton fan.\n\nLiverpool stopped finishing their chances at the worst time of the season, and their bid to supply Jurgen Klopp with a fairytale ending is likely to only be viewed through the Grimm Brothers' lens -- with darker hues amid great entertainment.\n\nSix-save Jordan Pickford had his game of the year for Everton, but Liverpool should've been able to solve the keeper amid 2.00 xG and 22 shot attempts.\n\nThe high-powered Liverpool attack short-circuited over the past 14 days.

Alisson felled Calvert-Lewin in a one-on-one, but the striker was found to be offside in the build-up and the penalty was overturned after a VAR review.\n\nThe Toffees looked particularly dangerous from free-kicks, and Liverpool were given a warning when Calvert-Lewin's thumping header was parried by Alisson.\n\nThe Toffees took the lead in the 26th minute as the ball pinged around their box, with Branthwaite's low shot eventually beating Alisson and spinning over the line off the inside of the post.\n\nJordan Pickford made three big saves to keep Everton in front at the break, denying Darwin Nunez, Diaz and Andy Robertson as Liverpool rallied.\n\nWhile the Reds also then made a bright start to the second half, they could not take their chances, and Calvert-Lewin punished them from a corner as he rose unmarked at the back post to thump a towering header into the bottom-left corner for his third goal in four matches.\n\nLiverpool went closest to scoring in the 69th minute as Diaz's brilliant curler struck the right-hand post - the 22nd time Liverpool have hit the woodwork in the league this season.\n\nMohamed Salah also squandered a late chance, blazing over the bar from close range, to sum up a wasteful night in front of goal for the Reds as Everton held on for a potentially pivotal result at both ends of the table.\n\nFor the 22nd time in all competitions this season, Liverpool were punished for a slow start as they conceded the opening goal.\n\nKlopp, on his farewell tour, was aiming to become the first Reds manager to win 10 Premier League Merseyside derbies but instead suffered just his second loss against the Toffees (W9 D6).\n\nIt was just Liverpool's second defeat in their last 27 games against Everton and, with Man City having two games in hand, it could have just ended their title challenge.\n\nEach of Everton's last seven victories in the Premier League have been to nil, an impressive feat as they have failed to win any of their last 12 when conceding at least once.\n\nThey had to dig deep to get another vital three points in the relegation battle, keeping Liverpool at bay with impressive blocks from the brilliant Branthwaite, James Tarkowski and Ben Godfrey, as well as excellent saves from Pickford, who was on form to deny Harvey Elliott and Salah in the dying embers.\n\nThis win has also ended a run of 12 without a victory against Liverpool in the Premier League at home, which was their longest such run against any other opponent in their league history.\n\nNine days ago, Everton were thrashed 6-0 by Chelsea. Now, after just their second derby win in over 13 years, they are within touching distance of safety.\n\nEverton report | Liverpool report\n\nEverton have beaten Liverpool at home in the Premier League for the first time since October 2010 (also a 2-0 win), ending their 12-game winless run in Merseyside derbies at Goodison Park (D9 L3 before tonight).\n\nLiverpool have lost two of their last three Premier League games (W1), as many defeats as in their previous 42 matches in the competition combined (W28 D12).\n\nEverton have won three of their last four Premier League games (L1), having failed to win any of their previous 13 league matches before this run (D6 L7).\n\nLiverpool have gone 1-0 down in 15 different Premier League games this season.

This was his 19th derby and his first ever defeat at Goodison Park as well as just his second against Everton. Yet this will certainly hurt the most as it was seriously damaging to Liverpool's title hopes.\n\nThey now look all but over. Two slip ups are needed from Arsenal and Manchester City to stand a chance but neither look ready to stumble.\n\nBut the Reds have certainly tripped up. That's eight points dropped in just over a fortnight. This game might be seen as the end of their bid but their fall had already begun against Manchester United and Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Everton fans were loving it. Not only did this win move them one victory from being mathematically safe, they also got the added bonus landing a huge blow to their nearest rivals. They've only won once against them in 14 years and that was at an empty Anfield during Covid times.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored here for their first home win over their neighbours since 2010. The scorer of the second that night? Mikel Arteta. The Arsenal boss may have enjoyed this one as much.\n\nEverton outfought and outworked Liverpool almost everywhere on the pitch. They targeted them at set pieces and they got their reward. Everton are in the battle to stay up so you would expect them to put up a fight but Liverpool going for the title should have been more up for a scrap.\n\nWere you surprised by Liverpool's defeat? Have your say in the comments section\n\nJarrad Branthwaite set Everton on their way to victory\n\nToffees boss Sean Dyche should have started wearing the tracksuit ages ago. It's two wins in two with the casual attire. This was exactly the final Merseyside derby Klopp didn't want. It was frantic and foul-filled. Most of them by his side in the first half hour.\n\nIt was the eighth one and the sixth near the area which gave Everton what was a worthy lead in the 27th minute. Alisson poorly dealt with a low strike from Branthwaite as he scampered across goal and it squeezed in off the post.\n\nThe Kop keeper had earlier denied Calvert-Lewin from a header with a parried stop but he was poor for the goal.\n\nKlopp was animated on the touchline as he tried to orchestrate his side back into it.\n\nThey had chances at the end of the half but Jordan Pickford thwarted Darwin Nunez twice and Mo Salah scooped one over. Everton knew a third win in four games would move them eight clear of the bottom three with four games to go. Liverpool knew defeat would almost spell the end of their title hopes.\n\nSo the second in the 58th minute was huge at both ends of the table. Dwight McNeil tested Alisson with a long range effort that the Brazilian had to push over.\n\nJurgen Klopp's Liverpool were unable to get the derby result they needed\n\nFrom the resulting corner from the man who won it, came the Calvert-Lewin second as he rose at the back post and headed in amid awful defending from Liverpool. Goodison couldn't settle despite the lead. Luis Diaz hit the post for the Reds but a raft of changes from Klopp couldn't inspire a Kop comeback.\n\nOne of those subs was Harvey Elliott and he tried a long-range effort. But the brilliant Pickford tipped it over and finally the Toffees fans could enjoy a home win in the Merseyside derby for the first time in 14 years as they began to give Klopp a tune to remember them by.\n\nThe German has enjoyed some memorable Merseyside Derby moments but this won't be one.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The commitment and energy from us had to be there.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Godfrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Godfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/XYRTZBXADZFQRKIEC2SE5RKF7E?smart=true&auth=8e6126ef25243defc7ddcb18be976c653b06d84e80a87c71fe84f88785acd537&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Their first win over Liverpool at Goodison Park since 2010 also put a huge dent in their rivals' title challenge.\n\nLiverpool are now three points off Arsenal following their 5-0 win over Chelsea, while Manchester City are just a point behind with two games in hand. It was a party atmosphere when the final whistle blew and Everton fans made the most of it, blaring out: \"You lost the league at Goodison Park\" to taunt the Liverpool players and their fans.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite opened the scoring for Everton, tucking a loose ball under Alisson in the second phase from a corner. It was 2-0 in the second half when Dominic Calvert-Lewin rose highest to head in. Liverpool had chances, but Darwin Nunez blasted straight at Jordan Pickford and Mohamed Salah was off target.\n\nFormer Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was definitive in his post-match take: Liverpool have surrendered their chance at winning the Premier League title. \"In terms of wanting it more, it's Everton's night. It's not been easy and you have seen their record in derby games so you have to accept that as a Liverpool fan,\" he began on Sky Sports.\n\n\"This is the end of the title run for Liverpool. It almost feels like the end. They just have to make sure they finish the season strong. They had enough chances in the game. At the moment, they are not clinical enough in both boxes. I don't think it's the time to get too angry with the team and Jurgen Klopp. It's been a great ride, a great journey, but tonight is Everton's night and you have to take it on the chin.\"\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Are Liverpool out of the title race? Comment below.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite scored Everton's first goal on the night\n\nA dejected Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was in agreement. \"If we play like today then we have no chance to consider ourselves in the title race,\" he admitted. \"We have to just focus on the next game, and that will be a tough one as well, and then we will see.\"\n\nLiverpool are back in action against West Ham in the early kick-off on Saturday and have no other distractions, having been knocked out of the Europa League by Atalanta last week. But it now appears very unlikely that they can end Jurgen Klopp's final season in charge with a second league title under his management.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

But there was no coming back.\n\nKlopp's downbeat demeanour in his post-match media briefing told the story after his first derby defeat at Goodison Park. He was certainly not throwing the towel in, and rightly so, but he wore the look of someone who knew the game may well be up.\n\nLiverpool are still only three points behind leaders Arsenal but their form is going into reverse and the Gunners' goal difference is so superior it is effectively worth another point.\n\nAmid the joyous scenes at the final whistle, there is every chance Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola may also have been allowing themselves a smile.\n\nAnd it was a game that also left two big questions.\n\nWhere has this Everton been for large portions of another season of struggle? And what has happened to Liverpool, especially those tasked with scoring goals, with even Mohamed Salah misfiring miserably once again?\n\nDarwin Nunez must be trying the patience of the Liverpool supporters who have stood by him so long. The chaos that sustained him despite his habit of missing chances is now narrowed down and being replaced by just the missed chances.\n\nEven Virgil van Dijk was unsettled, throwing his arms out in disgust as Calvert-Lewin soared behind him for Everton's second goal.\n\nLiverpool pressed on but not with conviction or urgency, almost resigned to their fate - something which could not be said often in Klopp's reign.\n\nEven the manager himself raised eyebrows with his substitutions, taking off Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson and replacing them with Joe Gomez and Kostas Tsimikas when Liverpool needed goals.\n\nKlopp must lift his players for the weekend visit to West Ham United but they must also find something they have lost in recent weeks if they are to have even the slightest chance of regrouping to challenge Arsenal and Manchester City.\n\nLiverpool looked like a side who have gone to the well too often, with two losses and a draw in their past four league games, minds scrambled by the way Everton set about them, with Calvert-Lewin showing what manager Sean Dyche has missed when the striker is at his best.\n\nAnd what of Everton? Barely a week after a 6-0 humbling at Chelsea they were a team transformed, the sight of Liverpool like a red rag to a bull.\n\nThe goals Liverpool conceded where hardly the result of surprises being sprung on them. Everton's trademark is set-piece power plays and both goals resulted from them. The second goal, a Dwight McNeil corner met by Calvert-Lewin, was as routine as it gets but Liverpool could not cope.\n\nEverton and their followers have been very short on reasons to let it all hang out in celebration apart from in late escapes from relegation as the club lurched towards the footballing and financial precipice, with eight points being deducted this season.\n\nSo it was no surprise to see some of their supporters dancing down Goodison Road in the direction of the famous Evertonian pub across from Goodison Park, The Winslow.\n\nDyche, whose style of play has been something of an acquired taste to some Everton fans, got it spot on here and deserved to fully enjoy the finest night since his appointment.\n\nHe did not have to look hard for heroes in the shape of goalscorers Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin, the faultless Idrissa Gueye in midfield and keeper Pickford, who delivered several crucial saves and even indulged in some Klopp-style fist pumps towards Everton's fans after one final save from Salah in the dying seconds.\n\nKlopp apologised to Liverpool's fans, many of whom left before the final whistle, for the bitter taste left by his final Merseyside derby.\n\nHe will know how much this will hurt, not just because they were beaten by Everton, because they may have taken a blow from which their Premier League title challenge will not recover.\n\nFor Everton, this was the sort of night they waited a long time for - more than 13 years in this fixture at Goodison Park - and the outpouring of joy matched this thunderous occasion.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup_Winners'_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Cup Winners' Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostas_Tsimikas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kostas Tsimikas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gomez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gomez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrissa_Gueye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idrissa Gueye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/ba143a2d8099c077d31abd073d62238d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-10-", "textStart": 256, "textEnd": 268}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Listen on Spotify, Apple or anywhere you get your podcasts\n\nThe only consolation for Jurgen Klopp was that he didn't have far to go home. Safe at home by the water in Formby to reflect on the night his final great title challenge in English football was washed away on a blue tide of desire and yearning.\n\nIs this really it for Klopp and Liverpool? You would have to think so. The statistics tell their own story. Four points from their last four league games has left them needing miracles that don't tend to happen when Manchester City are involved.\n\nWith Arsenal driven by renewed ferver also, there surely is no way back for the third horse in the race. So it seems that Klopp will leave Anfield with honour next month but not swaddled in glory. There were four trophies on the go at one stage. It seems he will leave this time with just one, the Carabao Cup.\n\nAnd what a place for the house to finally fall down. Goodison Park, of all places. Klopp had not lost here before and the timing of this defeat could not have been worse.\n\nEverton were at it all night. Energetic, determined and full of running. Sean Dyche's team played some good football too. Liverpool enjoyed an awful lot of possession - don't they always? - but Everton were better in both penalty areas and as such deserved everything they took from this night.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin doubled the advantage for the home side in the 58th minute of the clash\n\nJarrad Branthwaite gave Everton a richly-deserved lead after 27 minutes of a frenetic Merseyside derby\n\nLiverpool missed the chance to draw level with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Listen to our EXCLUSIVE interview with Phil Foden IAKO! - Nottingham Forest are making fools of themselves!

Play on Apple Spotify\n\nDenied an early penalty by a VAR offside call, Everton nevertheless took the lead in the first half through young central defender Jarrad Branthwaite. Liverpool created and missed chances.\n\nDarwin Nunez and Mo Salah two culprits as Liverpool pushed for parity. Then, with the night still in the balance just before the hour, Dominic Calvert-Lewin rose at a far post corner to head down and in with no Liverpool player anywhere near him.\n\nTwenty minutes later, however, even the VAR officials were not to deny the home town. They did have a look once again, this time at Branthwaite's positioning as a hopeful ball was lifted over the top.\n\nBut he was just the right side of the line and as such his goal - that came after Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate deflected a loose ball in to his path - was allowed to stand.\n\nEverton deserved the lead at that stage. By then they had already come close through Abdoulaye Doucoure, who shot wide from close range, and Calvert-Lewin, whose header was pawed away by Alisson.\n\nEverton defender Ben Godfrey had also headed a good chance wide at the far post.\n\nThe home team were impressive while the visitor were not. Liverpool carried a threat when they went forward but lacked composure and real cohesion. Then when they did discover some fluency and start to create chances, they couldn't take them.\n\nThree times in the ten minutes immediately before half-time, Liverpool could and maybe should have scored. Almost inevitably, given his recent form, Darwin Nunez was culpable on one occasion, running on to a cute Mo Salah pass only to shoot against Jordan Pickford's legs.\n\nIt was a good save and Pickford did it again a minute before the interval, this time denying Luis Diaz from similar close range after Salah and Nunez had combined to set him up. On both occasions, however, Pickford probably shouldn't have been given a chance and that was the case once again in first-half added time when Nunez laid a ball back to Salah 16 yards out and the Egyptian blazed wildly over.\n\nEverton were hanging on a little during the six extra minutes. Liverpool had found some more recognisable attacking threat. It had been an impressive first half performance from Dyche's players, though. The only question was whether they could keep up that level of intensity.\n\nLiverpool had already received a let out when an Everton penalty was denied for an offside in the build-up\n\nThe 21-year-old grabbed his third goal in a breakout Premier League campaign to send Goodison Park wild\n\nDarwin Nunez had a glorious opportunity to draw his side level with most of the goal gaping\n\nJurgen Klopp was in near-constant dialogue with the fourth official in the first half following his side's poor start\n\nThat did turn out to be an issue in the early stages of the second half. Liverpool pushed Everton back and the game felt different. The home team were no longer forcing the pace. Instead they were sitting in their own half soaking up pressure.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool open talks with Feyenoord after identifying Arne Slot as the ideal candidate to succeed Jurgen Klopp... as Reds face \u00a38.5m compensation fee to land the Dutchman Advertisement\n\nSome things didn't change, however. Liverpool still couldn't take chances. Nor, when it really mattered, could they defend.\n\nLiverpool were the dominant force, for sure. They were creating overloads in wide areas. They were winning corners. Virgil van Dijk saw a header from one such delivery held by Pickford and then Andrew Robertson failed to make good contact after Alexis MacAllister chipped a nice pass over the top.\n\nAnd then, perhaps to the surprise of nobody, Everton scored their second goal. Dwight McNeil forced Alisson to touch a shot over from 25 yards and when the corner was delivered to the far post, Calvert-Lewin rose to head down and in.\n\nWho was marking Everton's most dangerous player? Robertson was nearby and Van Dijk was in the vicinity also. But nobody was actually making life difficult for Calvert-Lewin and his finish was as comfortable as it was potentially decisive.\n\nCalvert-Lewin rose highest above the Liverpool defence to head past Alisson\n\nThe Toffees moved eight points clear of Luton in 17th with only four Premier League games left to play\n\nKlopp has seen what looked to be a fairytale end to his time as Liverpool boss turn into a nightmare\n\nSean Dyche claimed his third victory over Jurgen Klopp in his 15th meeting against the German\n\nKlopp responded by making three substitutions and one of them - Jarell Quansah for Konate - perhaps spoke volumes.\n\nEverton, meanwhile, tried to seal the game with a spell of pressure. Once again Liverpool were out of their comfort zone. With a little over 20 minutes of regular time to play, they needed three goals to save their season.\n\nThey almost scored one, Diaz hitting the inside of the post. There was still time on the clock at that point. But in truth there was little sign of a great comeback. Evertonians will remember this night for years to come.\n\nBy full-time a new ditty had entered the Everton song book. 'You lost the league at Goodison Park'. It won't be the last we hear of that one.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's a tough one and obviously we have to do much better against a side that is playing against relegation.\"\n\nEverton were sharper from the start and won a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Liverpool keeper Alisson only for it to be overturned by the VAR for an offside.\n\nYet it wasn't long before Branthwaite had the old stadium shaking in the 27th minute when he capitalised on poor defending from Liverpool, slotting home from close range after the Reds missed several attempts to clear the ball.\n\nAlisson could not quite get his hands on the ball which rolled off the post and in.\n\n'EXTRA SPECIAL'\n\nBranthwaite is the first Everton player to score against Liverpool since Demarai Gray in a 4-1 league home loss in late- 2021.\n\n\"We spoke about the desire and the energy of the team and the physical side of the game,\" Everton manager Sean Dyche said. \"The lads did it on Sunday (2-0 win over Nottingham Forest) and they'll have to do it again.

Klopp didn't need the reminder. The manager knew it was all over for him and for Liverpool.\n\nHaving been so desperate to step down from Liverpool at the end of this season with the Premier League trophy back at Anfield, Klopp must now face up to a long, empty farewell.\n\nIn the space of five weeks, hopes of a quadruple have evaporated with elimination from the FA Cup against Manchester United and the Europa League against Atalanta. That left Liverpool with only the Premier League available to add to the Carabao Cup they won against Chelsea in February.\n\nBut the league trophy has now pretty much disappeared over the horizon after this 2-0 defeat at Everton on Wednesday. Mathematically Liverpool can still win the title, but reality suggests something else.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: FA Cup, LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n\n- Read on ESPN+: Ranking Ten Hag's signings at Man United\n\nEverton's win was their first home victory in the Merseyside derby since 2010, but it meant so much more than three points for Dyche's team in their battle for Premier League survival. With Liverpool needing to win to move level with league leaders Arsenal and keep alive their hopes of finishing the season as champions, the joy of victory for Everton was all about wrecking their bitter rivals' chances.\n\nEverton's win was a fully deserved one following goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Not only did it leave Liverpool as rank outsiders to pip Arsenal and Manchester City to the title, it also ended Klopp's hopes of a glorious farewell as manager at Anfield. Klopp is vacating his post at the end of the season, with Feyenoord coach Arne Slot emerging as the leading candidate to replace him.\n\nKlopp has looked drained of energy in recent weeks as a run of four wins in nine games has derailed his team's season. Liverpool have dropped 10 points in their past seven games -- they only dropped seven in their previous 14 -- so Klopp's formidable powers of motivation have diminished as his personal finish line approaches.\n\nThere's a saying that once you think about quitting, you have already quit. Klopp would argue to the contrary, but those numbers point to everyone at Anfield beginning to switch off, subconsciously or otherwise. The result of that loss of focus and motivation was there for all to see on the pitch at Goodison.\n\nEverton simply ran harder, fought harder, played smarter and wanted it more than their opponents. Klopp had never lost a derby at Goodison going into his final one, but he will never be able to shake off the memory of his last visit to Liverpool's near neighbour.\n\nHaving heralded his \"mentality monsters\" so many times during his nine years as Liverpool manager, Klopp saw those same players shrink against more determined opponents. Mohamed Salah was anonymous, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez wasteful in front of goal once again and Dominik Szoboszlai unable to get into the game in midfield. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson were also unusually lacking in fight and quality in defence.\n\nKlopp's success at Anfield has been rooted in his ability to inspire his players to play with the energy and positivity that he has always projected from the sideline. But when he announced his decision to quit in January, he cited fatigue as a primary factor in his decision. That fatigue is now being manifested in his players, who failed to score for a third time in five games while falling to their third defeat in that same sequence.\n\n\"We created chances, but don't score enough and that doesn't help,\" Klopp said in his post-match news conference. \"You have to fight through these periods, that's never different. It's not a question of attitude, nobody is doing it on purpose, but it's my job to make them confident to do it. That's the most tricky part of football.\"\n\nKlopp is running out of time to turn the situation around. Liverpool have four games left to play and Arsenal are three points clear with a hugely superior goal difference. Manchester City are a point behind in third, but they have played two games fewer than Liverpool and can move into second with a draw at Brighton on Thursday.\n\nKlopp knows it is virtually over, saying Liverpool need both Arsenal and City to have a \"crisis\" if they are claw their way back into the title race.\n\nBut the most painful aspect of the defeat at Everton may be in the fact that Dyche's team won with plenty to spare.\n\nBranthwaite's opening goal on 27 minutes, a close-range shot that squirmed under goalkeeper Alisson Becker before going in off the post, came after a period of Everton dominance, while Calvert-Lewin showed more purpose and desire than any red-shirted opponent to head in from a corner on 58 minutes. Luis D\u00edaz hit a post late on for Liverpool, but they rarely looked like getting back into the game, and the same can be said for their chances of winning the title.\n\nLiverpool's title hopes were already fading before this trip to Goodison, but as he headed down the tunnel, Klopp knew the Everton fans were right. This is where the title was finally lost and where his reign as Liverpool manager entered its dying days.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors":

nodded wide as Liverpool struggled to cope with Everton's threat from set-pieces.\n\nMore comical defending from the Reds led to the opener on 27 minutes.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister's mishit fell perfectly for Branthwaite and the defender's effort went in off the post despite Alisson's best efforts.\n\nGoing behind woke Liverpool from their slumber and only a combination of wasteful finishing

in the Everton half after the break, yet the hosts pulled further clear just before the hour mark from another dead ball.\n\nCalvert-Lewin was afforded a free header at the back post to power home Dwight McNeil's corner.\n\nLiverpool's night was summed up when Diaz's powerful effort came back off the post with Pickford finally beaten.\n\nBut it was Klopp who was crestfallen come the final

Everton's victory leaves Liverpool, who are in talks to appoint Feyenoord's Arne Slot as their new manager, trailing leaders Arsenal by three points and only one point above City, who have two games in hand. A dejected Klopp admitted Liverpool had only themselves to blame for the first Goodison derby defeat of his reign.\n\n\"To sum up, it was not good enough,\" said the Liverpool manager. \"We played the game, or let it happen, what Everton wanted. They scored two goals from set pieces. The first one we somehow defended three times but in the end we put it on a plate. Branthwaite didn't even kick the ball properly but the ball rolls over the line.\n\n\"After that we had our best period. We created big chances but didn't score. Each situation we missed gave Everton momentum even more. Second half as well, not good enough. Then you concede the second goal. I think everybody who is with Everton saw that goal already 20 times. That's their routine, everybody knows they put the ball there. The player is completely free. Obviously not the most inspired performance of all times. I really feel for the people, I am really sorry for that.\n\n\"We never lost here before and that feels really different. I really apologise for that. It was absolutely unnecessary but it happened. Now we have to recover because the quickest of all turnarounds is waiting for us [at West Ham at 12.30pm on Saturday]. I can imagine it will be a challenge, mentally and physically.\"\n\nAs for Liverpool's chances of winning the second Premier League title of his tenure, Klopp conceded they are fading. He added: \"I can't say now that we are still fully in it. We need a crisis at Man City and Arsenal and we need to win football games because if they start losing all their games and we do what we did tonight then nothing changes. We are not safe in the Champions League [qualification] as well so we should just play better football. That would be really good.\"\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was scathing over the end-of-season run that has seen Klopp's team drop points at Manchester United, Everton and at home to Crystal Palace. \"Everyone has to look in the mirror and look at their own performances and ask if they really gave everything and do they really want to win the league?\" said van Dijk. \"We still have games after tonight but I think if we play like we did today, not winning challenges and giving the ref the opportunity to give free-kicks like we did many times, then we have no chance to win the title.\"\n\nEverton manager, Sean Dyche, was by contrast delighted with his side's reaction to losing 6-0 at Chelsea nine days earlier. He said: \"The last two games [wins over Liverpool and Nottingham Forest] have been a real forceful show of a reaction. People said we don't care. Of course we care. How can you do my job and not care? The reaction has been fantastic from all concerned.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/9v-Mtwu4V4n801Qh93KsFDodVts=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/6BZXGC2EYIQ7X64BCORYGNX3WY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Jurgen Klopp heads to Goodison Park for a final time knowing the Reds simply have to come away with three points and move level with Arsenal at the top of the table with four games remaining. Everton, meanwhile, are desperate for a win that would put the Toffees on the brink of securing their Premier League safety under Sean Dyche.\n\nKlopp has never lost at Goodison but two wins from his previous seven trips across Stanley Park is an unusually poor return given Liverpool's dominance in this fixture under the German. Liverpool have the chance to respond to Arsenal's thrashing of Chelsea last night and put four points between themselves and Manchester City, who would have two games in hand.\n\nDyche's side were boosted by last weekend's win over Nottingham Forest and Everton would savour the chance to deny Klopp and Liverpool a final shot at the Premier League title ahead of the run-in. The Merseyside derby is typically full of goals and red cards, and this could be a classic with so much at stake in the title race and relegation battle.

But there was no coming back.\n\nKlopp's downbeat demeanour in his post-match media briefing told the story after his first derby defeat at Goodison Park. He was certainly not throwing the towel in, and rightly so, but he wore the look of someone who knew the game may well be up.\n\nLiverpool are still only three points behind leaders Arsenal but their form is going into reverse and the Gunners' goal difference is so superior it is effectively worth another point.\n\nAmid the joyous scenes at the final whistle, there is every chance Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola may also have been allowing themselves a smile.\n\nAnd it was a game that also left two big questions.\n\nWhere has this Everton been for large portions of another season of struggle? And what has happened to Liverpool, especially those tasked with scoring goals, with even Mohamed Salah misfiring miserably once again?\n\nDarwin Nunez must be trying the patience of the Liverpool supporters who have stood by him so long. The chaos that sustained him despite his habit of missing chances is now narrowed down and being replaced by just the missed chances.\n\nEven Virgil van Dijk was unsettled, throwing his arms out in disgust as Calvert-Lewin soared behind him for Everton's second goal.\n\nLiverpool pressed on but not with conviction or urgency, almost resigned to their fate - something which could not be said often in Klopp's reign.\n\nEven the manager himself raised eyebrows with his substitutions, taking off Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson and replacing them with Joe Gomez and Kostas Tsimikas when Liverpool needed goals.\n\nKlopp must lift his players for the weekend visit to West Ham United but they must also find something they have lost in recent weeks if they are to have even the slightest chance of regrouping to challenge Arsenal and Manchester City.\n\nLiverpool looked like a side who have gone to the well too often, with two losses and a draw in their past four league games, minds scrambled by the way Everton set about them, with Calvert-Lewin showing what manager Sean Dyche has missed when the striker is at his best.\n\nAnd what of Everton? Barely a week after a 6-0 humbling at Chelsea they were a team transformed, the sight of Liverpool like a red rag to a bull.\n\nThe goals Liverpool conceded where hardly the result of surprises being sprung on them. Everton's trademark is set-piece power plays and both goals resulted from them. The second goal, a Dwight McNeil corner met by Calvert-Lewin, was as routine as it gets but Liverpool could not cope.\n\nEverton and their followers have been very short on reasons to let it all hang out in celebration apart from in late escapes from relegation as the club lurched towards the footballing and financial precipice, with eight points being deducted this season.\n\nSo it was no surprise to see some of their supporters dancing down Goodison Road in the direction of the famous Evertonian pub across from Goodison Park, The Winslow.\n\nDyche, whose style of play has been something of an acquired taste to some Everton fans, got it spot on here and deserved to fully enjoy the finest night since his appointment.\n\nHe did not have to look hard for heroes in the shape of goalscorers Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin, the faultless Idrissa Gueye in midfield and keeper Pickford, who delivered several crucial saves and even indulged in some Klopp-style fist pumps towards Everton's fans after one final save from Salah in the dying seconds.\n\nKlopp apologised to Liverpool's fans, many of whom left before the final whistle, for the bitter taste left by his final Merseyside derby.\n\nHe will know how much this will hurt, not just because they were beaten by Everton, because they may have taken a blow from which their Premier League title challenge will not recover.\n\nFor Everton, this was the sort of night they waited a long time for - more than 13 years in this fixture at Goodison Park - and the outpouring of joy matched this thunderous occasion.\n\nExplore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!\n\nClick on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaCYzPRAYlUPudDDe53x", "source": {"uri": "citinewsroom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Citinewsroom -

Instead, they were beaten up by Sean Dyche's belligerent Everton who were simply more up for the fight.\n\nA raucous Goodison Park got behind its side from the outset and the Toffees responded. Dyche's men came out of the blocks fast, didn't let their visitors settle and set about claiming another three points to take them closer to safety with no shortage of purpose.\n\nWhen Jarrad Branthwaite found the net in the 27th minute, it was richly deserved. The video assistant referee had already stepped in to overturn a penalty for the hosts - rightly, due to offside - but Everton didn't take a step back, instead they doubled down and continued to push.\n\nLiverpool had their moments, a strong end to the first half their best period of the game, with Jordan Pickford called into action a couple of times, making a particularly fine stop to deny Luis Diaz.\n\nBut they didn't return from the half-time break with the same intensity and 13 minutes into the second half, Dwight McNeil's inswinging corner reached the far post, where Dominic Calvert-Lewin - in his best Everton performance for some time - leapt unmarked and powered his header into Alisson's net.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin of Everton celebrates scoring his team's second goal\n\nLiverpool would throw men forwards and created chances. They managed plenty of shots. Their xG was higher and they had more touches in the opposition penalty area than their hosts.\n\nBut they didn't deserve anything more than the defeat they suffered. The faces of Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, substituted with just over five minutes of normal time to go, told the story as they sat down on the bench.\n\nTheir race, and Klopp's hopes for a final taste of silverware at Anfield on May 19, may just have gone up in smoke.\n\n1. The early fight\n\nSimply put, it was lost by Liverpool.\n\nFor the opening half hour, Everton were running harder, jumping higher and winning the 50-50s. And the 40-60s. Even the 30-70s.\n\nWhile Jurgen Klopp was berating fourth official Simon Hooper on the touchline, his opposite number can only have been delighted with how his side imposed themselves on this game. They weren't going to let Liverpool ease into it and dictate the tempo. They turned up the heat and Liverpool struggled to handle it. They were naive, weak and, given the amount of silly fouls they gave away in their own half, rather stupid.\n\nBranthwaite's opener rather summed it all up. The visitors didn't deal with the first ball, were beaten to the second and third, Konate's sliced clearance was panicked, and while a sprawling Alisson did his best, he couldn't keep it from going underneath him and squirming over the line.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite of Everton celebrates with teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin 2. Mr. Calvert-Lewin, nice to see you again\n\nIn a different universe, one where he hasn't suffered numerous injury issues and remains at his 2020-21 best, Euro 2024 would see Dominic Calvert-Lewin as back up to Harry Kane.\n\nInstead, he's got just 12 goals in his last 63 Premier League appearances - across three seasons coming into tonight - and is nowhere near. But on this night, maybe he rediscovered a little something.\n\nEverton's early aggression and physicality was epitomised by their No.9. He rattled both Virgil Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate, holding strong and standing firm, enjoying the physical battle, winning fouls and free-kicks, getting his side up the pitch and looking as sharp as he's looked in his long time.\n\n\"I wouldn't go so far as to say they've been beat up,\" declared Gary Neville on Sky Sports commentary. \"But they've been ruffled. Harassed.\"\n\nThat changed in the second half to: \"He's beating Liverpool's centre-halves up. He's on fire.\"\n\nCalvert-Lewin's goal was him at his best in the penalty area, a towering header after a prodigious leap at the far post.\n\nPerhaps, indeed hopefully, after an almost cursed last two-and-a-half years, the 27-year-old is finally starting to trust his body again. If that's indeed the case, and we start seeing this Calvert-Lewin on a more regular basis once more, it'll be huge for Everton for the rest of this season and beyond.\n\nVirgil van Dijk of Liverpool (L) and Alexis Mac Allister of Liverpool (R) show a look of dejection after conceding the opening goal 3. Mo back, no bang\n\nKlopp brought Mohamed Salah back into his attack, but the Egyptian hasn't been int the best form recently and that continued here.\n\nKlopp stated after the second leg in Bergamo that he was \"not concerned\" by Salah's recent form. That's despite only one goal from open play in his last seven games and a number of games where he just hasn't quite looked like himself.\n\nHe had chances here and had more shots in the game than anyone else on the field. However, too often they were scuffed, or wayward, and he couldn't produce the kind of clinical moment which has been a regular feature during his record-breaking time at Anfield.\n\nFor him, perhaps more than any other, a very disappointing night.\n\nMohamed Salah of Liverpool shows a look of dejection 4. Tigerish Garner\n\nThe former Manchester United youngster has grown in importance in recent weeks for Everton and he again had a fine game here.\n\nHe uses the ball well, closes down opponents with vigour, puts his foot in and wins tackles and isn't bad with a dead ball either.\n\nToo often this season Everton have lacked balance in midfield, but Garner and Idrissa Gueye have found a nice little partnership which both shields the defence diligently while has the ability to spring quick counters.\n\nGarner was up for the battle against Liverpool's midfield trio and was the star pick in that area.\n\n5. Klopp's final failure\n\nJurgen Klopp had never lost a Merseyside derby in the Premier League. He has now.\n\nAnd with his unbeaten record at Goodison, a second Premier League title has likely gone too.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Juergen Klopp's men are three points behind the Gunners (77) with four games to play.\n\nHolders Manchester City remain in the driver's seat on 73 points but with two games in hand, while Everton's victory has them breathing easier, eight points above the relegation zone in 16th.\n\n\"Very disappointed in so many ways and I think everyone has to look in the mirror look at their own performances, did they give everything and do they really want to win the league?\" Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk said.\n\n\"Obviously there are still games after tonight, but if we play like we did tonight, we have no chance to win the title. It's a tough one and obviously we have to do much better against a side that is playing against relegation.\"\n\nEverton were sharper from the start and won a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Liverpool keeper Alisson only for it to be overturned by the VAR for an offside.\n\nYet it wasn't long before Branthwaite had the old stadium shaking in the 27th minute when he capitalised on poor defending from Liverpool, slotting home from close range after the Reds missed several attempts to clear the ball.\n\nALSO READ | Liverpool opens talks with Feyenoord over coach Slot - reports\n\nAlisson could not quite get his hands on the ball which rolled off the post and in.\n\nBranthwaite is the first Everton player to score against Liverpool since Demarai Gray in a 4-1 league home loss in late- 2021.\n\nCalvert-Lewin leapt to head home from a corner kick to double the Toffees' lead in the 58th minute, and while Liverpool have mounted some masterful comebacks this season, Everton held strong to hand Klopp, who is leaving his role at the season's end, his first defeat at Goodison in his final derby.\n\n\"It's extra special, isn't it? Local derby -- I've been here long enough to know what it means to the fans, what it means to me,\" Calvert-Lewin told Sky Sports. \"Where we are in the league, we needed a massive three points and everything kind of came together tonight.\"\n\nLiverpool kept Everton keeper Jordan Pickford busy in the dying minutes as he leapt to bat Harvey Elliott's shot over the crossbar and then dived to save a shot from Reds talisman Mohamed Salah while Everton manager Sean Dyche looked at his watch in frustration, desperately wanting the final whistle to blow.\n\nIt was joyful bedlam when it finally did, with Everton's faithful serenading the team off the pitch.\n\n\"Great atmosphere, thoroughly deserved it, was a massive win. Hard work pays off,\" Pickford told Sky.\n\nWhile Liverpool, who had 77% possession and seven shots on target to Everton's six, won the League Cup earlier this season, the Premier League is the final trophy up for grabs for the Reds after they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Europa League.\n\nLatest on SportstarPremier League: Everton deals Liverpool big blow with shock 2-0 derby victory

Alisson felled Calvert-Lewin in a one-on-one, but the striker was offside in the build-up, and the penalty was overturned after a VAR review.\n\nThe Toffees looked particularly dangerous from free-kicks, and Liverpool were given a warning when Calvert-Lewin's thumping header was parried by Alisson.\n\nLiverpool were left to rue their slack defending in the 26th minute as it pinballed around their box, with Branthwaite's low shot eventually beating Alisson and spinning over the line off the inside of the post.\n\nJordan Pickford made three big saves to keep Everton in front at the break, denying Darwin Nunez, Diaz, and Andy Robertson as Liverpool rallied.\n\nWhile the Reds made a bright start to the second half, they could not take their chances, and Calvert-Lewin punished them from a corner as he rose unmarked at the back post to thump a towering header into the bottom-left corner for his third goal in four games.\n\nLiverpool's best chance fell to Diaz in the 69th minute as he finally unlocked Everton's defence, but a brilliant curler struck the right-hand post - the 22nd time Liverpool have hit the woodwork in the league this season.\n\nMohamed Salah also squandered a late chance, blazing over the bar from close range to sum up a wasteful night for the Reds as Everton held on for a potentially pivotal result at both ends of the table.\n\nDyche's defence rallies\n\nEach of Everton's last seven victories in the Premier League have been to nil, an impressive feat as they have failing to win any of their last 12 when conceding at least once (D4 L8).\n\nThey had to dig deep to get another vital three points in the relegation battle, keeping Liverpool at bay with impressive blocks from the brilliant Branthwaite, James Tarkowski and Ben Godfrey, as well as excellent saves from Pickford, who was on form to deny Harvey Elliott and Salah in the dying embers.\n\nThis win also ended a run of 12 without a victory against Liverpool in the Premier League at home, which was their longest such run against any other opponent in their league history.\n\nNine days ago, Everton were thrashed 6-0 by Chelsea. Now, after just their second derby win in over 13 years, they are within touching distance of safety.\n\nTitle hopes extinguished?\n\nFor the 22nd time in all competitions this season, Liverpool were punished for a slow start as they conceded the opening goal.\n\nJurgen Klopp, on his farewell tour, was aiming to become the first Reds manager to win 10 Premier League Merseyside derbies but instead suffered just his second loss against the Toffees (W9 D6).\n\nIt was just Liverpool's second defeat in their last 27 games against Everton (W12 D13), and with Man City having two games in hand, it could have just ended their title challenge.", "source": {"uri": "mykhel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myKhel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mykhel_team@mykhel.com", "name": "MyKhel Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Godfrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Godfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Tarkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Leagues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mykhel.com/img/2024/04/dcl_jwb7dd3t4x8f16nz7fdqauiuc.jpg?25042024070513", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Everton's victory leaves Liverpool, who are in talks to appoint Feyenoord's Arne Slot as their new manager, trailing leaders Arsenal by three points and only one point above City, who have two games in hand. A dejected Klopp admitted Liverpool had only themselves to blame for the first Goodison derby defeat of his reign.\n\n\"To sum up, it was not good enough,\" said the Liverpool manager. \"We played the game, or let it happen, what Everton wanted. They scored two goals from set pieces. The first one we somehow defended three times but in the end we put it on a plate. Branthwaite didn't even kick the ball properly but the ball rolls over the line.\n\n\"After that we had our best period. We created big chances but didn't score. Each situation we missed gave Everton momentum even more. Second half as well, not good enough. Then you concede the second goal. I think everybody who is with Everton saw that goal already 20 times. That's their routine, everybody knows they put the ball there. The player is completely free. Obviously not the most inspired performance of all times. I really feel for the people, I am really sorry for that.\n\n\"We never lost here before and that feels really different. I really apologise for that. It was absolutely unnecessary but it happened. Now we have to recover because the quickest of all turnarounds is waiting for us (at West Ham at 12.30pm on Saturday). I can imagine it will be a challenge, mentally and physically.\"\n\nAs for Liverpool's chances of winning the second Premier League title of his tenure, Klopp conceded they are fading. He added: \"I can't say now that we are still fully in it. We need a crisis at Man City and Arsenal and we need to win football games because if they start losing all their games and we do what we did tonight then nothing changes. We are not safe in the Champions League [qualification] as well so we should just play better football. That would be really good.\"\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was scathing over the end-of-season run that has seen Klopp's team drop points at Manchester United, Everton and at home to Crystal Palace. \"Everyone has to look in the mirror and look at their own performances and ask if they really gave everything and do they really want to win the league?\" said van Dijk. \"We still have games after tonight but I think if we play like we did today, not winning challenges and giving the ref the opportunity to give free-kicks like we did many times, then we have no chance to win the title.\"\n\nEverton manager, Sean Dyche, was by contrast delighted with his side's reaction to losing 6-0 at Chelsea nine days earlier. He said: \"The last two games (wins over Liverpool and Nottingham Forest) have been a real forceful show of a reaction. People said we don't care. Of course we care. How can you do my job and not care? The reaction has been fantastic from all concerned.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_hunter@theguardian.com", "name": "Andy Hunter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5926a9c6c9d24c929b059472df13085f35497c/0_60_2956_1774/master/2956.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=184aae678860bd4a4881db0804df4d14", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

leave Premier League hopes in ruins", "body": "Liverpool (AFP) - Everton secured their first win in a Merseyside derby at Goodison Park since 2010 to leave Liverpool's Premier League title aspirations in ruins after a 2-0 defeat on Wednesday.\n\nDefeat leaves Jurgen Klopp's men still three points adrift of leaders Arsenal and only one point in front of defending champions Manchester City, who have two games in hand.\n\nGoals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin took Everton eight points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nThe Toffees now look certain to extend their 70-year stay in the English top flight despite being deducted eight points on two charges of breaching financial rules.\n\nKlopp had never lost on his previous eight visits to Goodison but his final taste of the Merseyside derby was a bitter one.\n\nHopes of a glorious goodbye for the German after a nearly nine-year reign that has transformed the club's fortunes are fading fast.\n\nAccording to reports, Feyenoord boss Arne Slot is being lined up as Klopp's successor and the past few weeks have exposed weaknesses that need addressing in a huge summer for the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nThe Reds have won just one of their last four league games and have also bowed out of the FA Cup and Europa League in recent weeks.\n\nKlopp made six changes after resting a number of key players for Sunday's 3-1 win at Fulham but did not get the response he desired.\n\nSlow starts have been a recurring factor as Liverpool's quest for four trophies has unravelled.\n\nBuoyed by their weekend win over Nottingham Forest to pull clear of the relegation zone, Everton are a side transformed from the one that went 13 Premier League games without a win between December and April.\n\nThe home side thought they had a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Alisson Becker but VAR intervened to save the visitors as the Everton striker was offside.\n\nAlisson then clawed away a Calvert-Lewin header and Ben Godfrey nodded wide as Liverpool struggled to cope with Everton's threat from set-pieces.\n\nMore comical defending from the Reds led to the opener on 27 minutes.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister's mishit fell perfectly for Branthwaite and the defender's effort went in off the post despite Alisson's best efforts.\n\nGoing behind woke Liverpool from their slumber and only a combination of wasteful finishing and Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's lead until half-time.\n\nDarwin Nunez blasted straight at the England number one when clean through before the Uruguayan teed up Luis Diaz to fire too close to Pickford.\n\nMohamed Salah's loss of form has come at the worst possible time for Liverpool's title challenge and the Egyptian sliced another good opening well over the bar.\n\nLiverpool were camped in the Everton half after the break, yet the hosts pulled further clear just before the hour mark from another dead ball.\n\nCalvert-Lewin was afforded a free header at the back post to power home Dwight McNeil's corner.\n\nLiverpool's night was summed up when Diaz's powerful effort came back off the post with Pickford finally beaten.\n\nBut it was Klopp who was crestfallen come the final whistle as he looks set to depart Anfield with just one Premier League title to his name.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

We should have done better but we didn't.\"\n\nJarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored in a 2-0 victory that will not soon be forgotten by the Everton faithful at Goodison Park, who serenaded the visitors with \"You lost the league at Goodison Park\" after the final whistle.\n\nKlopp could only shake his head about Calvert-Lewin's 58th-minute goal from a corner kick, saying Everton have had that set piece in their playbook all season and his players were prepared for it.\n\nKlopp said he was disappointed \"with a lot of things\".\n\n\"We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted. Two goals from set pieces. We created a lot but didn't score. We were in a rush, not really clear enough. But we were not good enough, that's what we have to admit, absolutely.\n\n\"Of course I didn't expect that today but it happened anyway. Obviously it's not the greatest moment we are in. In the end it's not good enough. When you win you have 500 reasons. When you lose, it's just not good enough.\"\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was blunt in his assessment, telling Sky Sports, \"We have to do much better.\n\n\"If we play like today we have no chance to consider ourselves in the title race].\"\n\nThe quest for the quadruple could now be coming back to haunt Klopp as Liverpool look to have run out of steam.\n\nThey have played 54 games this season and will have four more before the end of the campaign.\n\nA number of academy graduates stepped up during an injury crisis in the early months of 2024 and helped ensure Klopp did at least secure some silverware in his final season by winning the League Cup in February.\n\nYet, just as they are getting major players back with Alisson Becker and Trent Alexander-Arnold returning in recent weeks, those that have been relied on most during the winter months are fading.\n\nKlopp admitted after the Palace match that midfield duo Alexis Mac Allister and Wataru Endo are struggling due to the burden placed upon them earlier in the campaign.\n\n\"Players who played all the games are less fresh but it is the same for the other teams.

Jarrad Branthwaite opened the scoring in the 27th minute before Dominic Calvert-Lewin doubled Everton's lead in the 58th minute.\n\nLiverpool had 23 attempts on goal with seven being on target but failed to score, which has become a trend in recent games. They recently drew 2-2 against Manchester United at Old Trafford on April 7. They had 28 total attempts on goal, with 16 coming in the first half itself, but scored just twice.\n\nAfter the defeat in the Merseyside derby, Jurgen Klopp spoke about the Premier League title race and his side missing chances and said (via ECHO):\n\n\"I understand it, it's part of the business but I don't know why I have to answer this question [about the title race], you can read the table. I can't say now that we are still fully in it, we need a crisis at Man City and Arsenal and need to win football games because if they start losing all their games and we do what we did tonight nothing changes.\"\n\nHe added:\n\n\"We are not safe in the Champions League (qualification) as well so we should just play better football. That would be really [good]. You can see we are in a rush in front of goal.\n\n\"It's long ago now but I blame the Manchester United game a little when you play really well, with all those chances and don't get anything for it. And that is really bad. Since then we create but don't score often enough. That doesn't help.\"\n\nLiverpool have had 64 attempts on goal in four games between United and Everton, scoring just four goals. This saw them losing against Crystal Palace at home and getting eliminated from the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals against Atalanta.\n\nLiverpool fail to keep up with Arsenal in Premier League title race\n\nComing into the midweek fixtures, Arsenal were at the top of the league standings, with Liverpool behind them on goal difference. The Gunners then hammered London rivals Chelsea 5-0 at home on Wednesday and the Reds need to respond in the Merseyside derby.\n\nHowever, it wasn't to be as Everton were brilliant at Goodison Park and gave the Reds plenty of problems. They had 16 attempts on goal with six being on target despite having just 23% possession. It was Jurgen Klopp's first-ever defeat at Goodison Park.\n\nLiverpool are still second in the table but are now three points behind Arsenal. They are a point above Manchester City, who have two games in hand. They have another big test coming up when they face West Ham United away on Saturday, April 27.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_singh@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Aditya Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/999c2-17140263428851-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 155, "textEnd": 163}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-07", "textStart": 638, "textEnd": 645}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 2750, "textEnd": 2758}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Juergen Klopp's men are three points behind the Gunners (77) with four games to play.\n\nHolders Manchester City remain in the driver's seat on 73 points but with two games in hand, while Everton's victory has them breathing easier, eight points above the relegation zone in 16th.\n\n\"Very disappointed in so many ways and I think everyone has to look in the mirror look at their own performances, did they give everything and do they really want to win the league?\" Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk said.\n\n\"Obviously there are still games after tonight, but if we play like we did tonight, we have no chance to win the title. It's a tough one and obviously we have to do much better against a side that is playing against relegation.\"\n\nEverton were sharper from the start and won a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Liverpool keeper Alisson only for it to be overturned by the VAR for an offside.\n\nYet it wasn't long before Branthwaite had the old stadium shaking in the 27th minute when he capitalised on poor defending from Liverpool, slotting home from close range after the Reds missed several attempts to clear the ball.\n\nAlisson could not quite get his hands on the ball which rolled off the post and in.\n\nBranthwaite is the first Everton player to score against Liverpool since Demarai Gray in a 4-1 league home loss in late- 2021.\n\nCalvert-Lewin leapt to head home from a corner kick to double the Toffees' lead in the 58th minute, and while Liverpool have mounted some masterful comebacks this season, Everton held strong to hand Klopp, who is leaving his role at the season's end, his first defeat at Goodison in his final derby.\n\n\"It's extra special, isn't it? Local derby -- I've been here long enough to know what it means to the fans, what it means to me,\" Calvert-Lewin told Sky Sports. \"Where we are in the league, we needed a massive three points and everything kind of came together tonight.\"\n\nLiverpool kept Everton keeper Jordan Pickford busy in the dying minutes as he leapt to bat Harvey Elliott's shot over the crossbar and then dived to save a shot from Reds talisman Mohamed Salah while Everton manager Sean Dyche looked at his watch in frustration, desperately wanting the final whistle to blow.\n\nIt was joyful bedlam when it finally did, with Everton's faithful serenading the team off the pitch.\n\n\"Great atmosphere, thoroughly deserved it, was a massive win. Hard work pays off,\" Pickford told Sky.\n\nWhile Liverpool, who had 77% possession and seven shots on target to Everton's six, won the League Cup earlier this season, the Premier League is the final trophy up for grabs for the Reds after they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Europa League.\n\n(Reporting by Lori Ewing Editing by Toby Davis)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarai_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demarai Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corner kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Bar_Billiards", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Bar Billiards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 20, "textEnd": 28}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

As they have so often in recent weeks, Jurgen Klopp's team began the game sloppily, handing Everton the advantage in a crucial game for both sides.\n\nVAR ruled out an early penalty for the home side for offside but one of the most slapdash goals of the entire Premier League season put Everton into the lead midway through the first half. Liverpool fought back, but their other constant current issue -- wayward finishing -- ensured Sean Dyche's team led at half-time.\n\nAnd Everton continued where they left off in the second half, doubling their lead through a Dominic Calvert-Lewin header on 58 minutes. Once again Liverpool dominated possession but could not break down their dogged neighbours. Their dreams of a 20th league title in Klopp's final season are surely over, as are Everton's relegation fears.\n\nHere, Andy Jones and Patrick Boyland answer some of the key questions from tonight's game at Goodison Park.\n\nLiverpool could not have started Jurgen Klopp's final derby more poorly if they had tried.\n\nThey were second best by a distance to an Everton team who were hungrier and sharper than Liverpool despite the dire title-race implications if they took anything less than three points from Goodison Park.\n\nA terrible start culminated in going behind to Jarrad Branthwaite's 27th minute effort in a goal befitting of the scrambled brains Liverpool were displaying.\n\nAfter Liverpool had conceded another cheap free-kick, Branthwaite won the initial header although it came off his shoulder. Alexis Mac Allister's initial header was only cleared to the edge of the box. Alexander-Arnold completely missed his header which allowed Everton to play the ball back into the box.\n\nJack Harrison squared the ball to Ben Godfrey who saw his shot blocked by Konate and cannon off his body. Konate then flashed his leg at the ball when Mac Allister was set to clear the danger behind him.\n\nThe sliced clearance span across straight to the Everton centre-back. Alisson got a fair amount of his body on the ball but could only divert it onto the post and it spun agonisingly over the line.\n\nEverton deserved their lead while Liverpool were left looking at each other with hands outstretched and an inquest ongoing.\n\nLiverpool won only 25 percent of the duels in the first half. In their most important game of the season, in a Merseyside derby they had to win, Klopp's team were timid and failed to show up.\n\nThey all had big chances, they all should have found the back of the net - none of them did.\n\nAfter Everton took the lead, Liverpool finally began to play attacking football and look somewhat like themselves.\n\nIt culminated in a host of excellent chances, but as was the case in the 1-0 defeat to Crystal Palace Liverpool were let down by their poor finishing and lack of composure.\n\nWhen Nunez took the ball in his stride after 35 minutes the goal gaped. Placement was needed but as can happen with Nunez he chose power, blasting the ball at Jordan Pickford's legs.\n\nDiaz did similar minutes later. A trickier chance, but one a player of his quality would expect to do better from. Again his shot was straight at Pickford.\n\nSalah's first chance didn't come until the final minutes of the half but he also hadn't brought his shooting boots. A layoff from Nunez found the Egypt international in the centre of the box. His first shot was blocked but was travelling wide, and his second sailed harmlessly over the bar.\n\nLiverpool's quality in front of goal has evaporated in recent weeks, coinciding with their slip in form -- Nunez and Salah suffering especially. Despite positive signs at Fulham, at Goodison Park they fell back into the bad habits they have developed and it cost them hugely.\n\nAndy Jones\n\nSean Dyche's teams may be known for their set-piece prowess, but the extent of their aerial dominance against Virgil Van Dijk and co still came as a surprise.\n\nEverton bullied Liverpool from free-kicks and corners, with both goals coming via that avenue. For the first, Branthwaite fired under Alisson at the back post after the visitors had failed to clear their lines. The second was a Dyche favourite; McNeil's superb inswinging corner converted by Calvert-Lewin in front of the Gwladys.\n\nIt was a leap reminiscent of Calvert-Lewin at his best, as he towered over Van Dijk to convert. After a lengthy barren run in front of goal, the striker is finding form again and now has three in his last three starts. Everton had already threatened from set pieces before that, with Ben Godfrey and Calvert-Lewin both going close.\n\nAfter half an hour, Dyche's side had won a staggering 75 per cent of their duels, comfortably the most in the league this season. They started quickly, got in Liverpool's faces and won the duels as Dyche had requested pre-game.\n\nThis was Everton's best performance of the season, a massive victory in their battle for survival, and owed much to their combative edge.\n\nPatrick Boyland\n\nThere are ways to see your title challenge end - ideally in a blaze of glory. Then there are the worst ways to see it go up in flames.\n\nThis is as bad as it gets. A defeat to your local rivals smashing any hopes of the perfect send-off for Jurgen Klopp to smithereens.\n\nIt has been on the cards for a number of weeks. With the pressure on and the destiny of the title in their hands, Liverpool's last four league games have led to one win, one draw and two defeats -- in addition to FA Cup and Europa League exits in recent months.\n\nThis was one of their worst performances of the season. So many players struggled with their first touch, others with decision-making and they played into Everton's hands, repeatedly handing them set-pieces. Only Luis Diaz can come out of the game with any credit.\n\nLiverpool had to win their final six games and hope Manchester City and Arsenal would slip up. They began with a 3-1 victory over Fulham but the defensive issues and attacking problems that have plagued them in recent weeks returned. Asking for one mistake from Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta's sides' was a lot, hoping for two is a dream.\n\nThe season's climax has become a nightmare. A title challenge was an overachievement for this new-look team in their first season together, but to have come so far and faded so poorly is a huge disappointment.\n\nThe efforts of the campaign and the accumulation of injuries has caught up to them, but that is not the sole factor their performance levels have disappeared. This was a derby and Liverpool simply failed to turn up.\n\nJurgen Klopp had never lost a Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. He has now -- and it is the worst one he could have lost. His farewell which at one time promised so much looks set to end with just the Carabao Cup.\n\nAndy Jones\n\nWe'll bring you this after they have spoken at the post-match press conference.\n\nSaturday, April 27: West Ham (A), Premier League, 12.30pm BST, 7.30am ET\n\nLiverpool go for a sixth win in a row against West Ham and their third of the season, after a 3-1 league victory in September and a 5-1 demolition in the Carabao Cup just before Christmas, both at Anfield.\n\nSaturday, April 27: Brentford (H), Premier League, 17.30pm BST, 12.30pm ET\n\nEverton will try and complete a league double over Brentford after winning 3-1 in west London in September.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In doing so, they also propelled themselves eight points clear of the relegation zone with just four games to play.\n\nThe night was a special one for Evertonians, with the match potentially the last Goodison derby under lights before the club moves stadium at the end of next season. And with Liverpool losing ground in the title race as a result of their defeat, plenty of talking points have been triggered in the aftermath.\n\nHere is a round-up of some of the national media reaction to the Everton win, along with the verdict from the ECHO's Joe Thomas.\n\nREAD MORE: Everton have got themselves a new 'Goodison God' after what he did against Liverpool\n\nREAD MORE: What Sean Dyche told Dominic Calvert-Lewin after 'loving' Everton sign\n\nAndy Hunter, The Guardian\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" the home crowd bellowed as they rejoiced in a deserved Everton victory, an outstanding Everton performance and the best night of Dyche's often-troubled reign. The imperious Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals that consigned Liverpool to a hugely damaging defeat.\n\nQuite simply, Everton wanted it more. That is damning of the team that arrived with designs on the title and in need of responding to Arsenal's emphatic defeat of Chelsea the night before. Liverpool have faltered at the worst possible time and in the worst possible places from their perspective. Everton and Manchester United will savour their contributions to the slump.\n\nDyche's players were fired up and Goodison responded in kind. The old ground pulsated as Everton performed with an intent, intensity and quality that has been absent too often this season. Where has this team been?\n\n...Trent Alexander-Arnold, sat on the bench, buried his head in his shirt. The image captured the pain of every Liverpool supporter.\n\nPaul Joyce, The Times\n\nThe caustic chants had started in added time and reverberated over and over again: \"You lost the league at Goodison Park. You lost the league at Goodison Park.\"\n\nThe gaps in the Liverpool end that had appeared like pulled teeth shortly before the final whistle suggested their supporters knew it to be true.\n\nContrary to perceived wisdom, \u00adJurgen Klopp did not depart empty handed. Instead, he left pursued by a sense of anger and recrimination and with one more reason to detest the Merseyside derby.\n\n...The final act was of Everton \u00adsupporters bouncing and singing \u00adthemselves hoarse, shrugging off the misery that has gripped them far too \u00adoften. All that dejection belongs to \u00adLiverpool\n\nRichard Jolly, The Independent\n\nThis was just Klopp's second defeat in 19 derbies. A succession of Everton managers have lived and laboured in Klopp's sizeable shadow but now Sean Dyche finds himself in distinguished company with Carlo Ancelotti as the only ones to beat the German.\n\nAs the Italian's victory came in lockdown, Branthwaite's opener made it the first time a crowd had even seen Everton lead since 2013. Their previous triumph at Goodison was so long ago, in 2010, that one of the scorers may be a title-winning manager now. Mikel Arteta could certainly savour his old club's long-awaited triumph.\n\nFor Klopp, it was a first loss at Goodison. Everton displayed many of the traits the Liverpool manager wants: the fervent commitment, the fast start, the energy to galvanise the crowd. Goodison's penultimate derby was a raucous affair, Everton attacking with urgency and defending with defiance. For the most part, Liverpool had no answer to them.\n\n...And on a day when Liverpool moved closer to appointing Klopp's successor, Everton all but ensured that Arne Slot will not inherit the reigning champions.\n\nJoe Thomas, Liverpool Echo\n\nEverton finally produced a performance befitting of the final days of Goodison Park with a Merseyside derby display that meant its supporters could yell with vindication: \"The city is ours.\"\n\nOne of the great shames of this club's recent struggles has been that the Grand Old Lady has had to rally in desperation, not celebration, with those in the stands dragging a footballing institution from one survival campaign to the next.\n\nBut all of the wider problems surrounding this great club were forgotten during 90 minutes in which those in Royal Blue stunned Liverpool, all-but securing Everton's top-flight status for another year while delivering a hammer blow to the title ambitions of their fiercest rivals. And make no mistake: This was not just a famous win. It was one that was deserved.\n\n...This beautiful stadium has deserved better than relegation fights in its final years. But it is at its fiercest best when this side has its back against the wall. This was a spiteful, aggressive, ruthless performance when this club really needed it.

leaves Jurgen Klopp's men still three points adrift of leaders Arsenal and only one point in front of defending champions Manchester City, who have two games in hand.\n\nGoals from Jarrad Branthwaite

points on two charges of breaching financial rules.\n\nKlopp had never lost on his previous eight visits to Goodison but his final taste of the Merseyside derby was a bitter one.\n\nHopes of a glorious goodbye for the German after a nearly nine-year reign that has transformed the club's fortunes are fading fast.\n\nAccording to reports, Feyenoord boss Arne Slot is being lined up as Klopp's successor and the past few weeks have exposed weaknesses that need addressing in a huge summer for the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nThe Reds have won just one of their last four league games and have also bowed out of the FA Cup and Europa League in recent weeks.\n\nKlopp made six changes after resting a number of key players for Sunday's 3-1 win at Fulham but did not get the response he desired.\n\nSlow starts have been a recurring factor as Liverpool's quest for four trophies has unravelled.\n\nBuoyed by their weekend win over Nottingham Forest to pull clear of the relegation zone, Everton are a side transformed from the one that went 13 Premier League games without a win between December and April.\n\nThe home side thought they had a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Alisson Becker but VAR intervened to save the visitors as the Everton striker was offside.\n\nAlisson then clawed away a Calvert-Lewin header and Ben Godfrey nodded wide as Liverpool struggled to cope with Everton's threat from set-pieces.\n\nMore comical defending from the Reds led to the opener on 27 minutes.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister's mishit fell perfectly for Branthwaite and the defender's effort went in off the post despite Alisson's best efforts.\n\nGoing behind woke Liverpool from their slumber and only a combination of wasteful finishing and Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's lead until half-time.\n\nDarwin Nunez blasted straight at the England number one when clean through before the Uruguayan teed up Luis Diaz to fire too close to Pickford.\n\nMohamed Salah's loss of form has come at the worst possible time for Liverpool's title challenge and the Egyptian sliced another good opening well over the bar.\n\nLiverpool were camped in the Everton half after the break, yet the hosts pulled further clear just before the hour mark from another dead ball.\n\nCalvert-Lewin was afforded a free header at the back post to power home Dwight McNeil's corner.\n\nLiverpool's night was summed up when Diaz's powerful effort came back off the post with Pickford finally beaten.\n\nBut it was Klopp who was crestfallen come the final whistle as he looks set to depart Anfield with just

The title dream is over for Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp, their fading hopes dismantled as neighbours Everton inflicted what is arguably the most deflating league result of the German's nine year reign.\n\nWhen it comes to Merseyside derbies in the Klopp era, Liverpool left the worst until last. Klopp's goodbye will not be romantic.\n\nSean Dyche, in contrast, may have belatedly begun an Everton love affair.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" sang a joyous Gwladys Street.\n\nIt was 14 years since Everton last won a Goodison derby. They ended that wait at the most consequential time to effectively guarantee Premier League safety.\n\nThis was a performance of commitment and organisation which defied Everton's lowly position and will have had Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta punching the air as much as the elated Evertonians.\n\nLiverpool succumbed to the occasion, playing into the hosts' hands with their inability to defend set-pieces - both Everton goals followed them - while their flaws in front of goal have been their Achilles heel in this title run-in.\n\nNot for the first time recently, Mohamed Salah was a shadow of himself, while Darwin Nunez's unconvincing form continued.\n\nLiverpool did not have the muscle to deal with a derby tussle which put one in mind of those in the 80s and 90s, when the right to play was as significant as the ability to.\n\nWhere and when it mattered, Everton demonstrated both, and from the moment Jarrad Branthwaite pounced to beat Alisson from close range, Liverpool lacked the class to recover.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin's Duncan Ferguson impression made it two early in the second half and Klopp's side looked increasingly helpless.\n\nKlopp's finale will now be all about ensuring the legacy for his expected replacement - Feyenoord's Arne Slot - is Champions League football. Liverpool are not sure of that yet and have Spurs and Aston Villa still to play.\n\nKlopp said he won't miss the Merseyside derby. It's a surprising admission given his record coming into this fixture, just one defeat in his previous 18 games and that in the cosmetic environment behind closed doors. He arrived at Goodison seeking to preserve an unbeaten record in the stadium.\n\nBut there are idiosyncrasies to this game like no other, Everton - rather like Manchester United in recent history - are a side who it is pointless Liverpool's scout watching in the build-up. Whatever they have shown in recent games will have no resemblance to the endeavour and intent when Liverpool arrive.\n\nThe varied gameplans were predictable. The outcome would be determined by which side could use their weaponry most effectively, and it was Everton who started with the most threat.\n\nThe strategy was obvious, every Everton player determined to dash towards a red wall in anticipation of a panicky challenge and foul. Liverpool kept obliging, ensuring their penalty box was peppered with free-kicks. How far away the set-play was of no significance in diluting the sense of danger for the visiting defence, Pickford ready to launch from deep in his own area with confidence a chance would follow.\n\nBen Godfrey wasted an early header, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin forced Alisson to push aside his attempt. Liverpool already looked fretful.\n\nThere was a greater scare for Liverpool's keeper when referee Andy Madley awarded a penalty after the Brazilian was late to challenge the advancing striker. The offside flag offered a reprieve.\n\nIt was brief. While Klopp contested the award of another free-kick, Liverpool's defenders dealt shoddily with another high ball and subsequent ricochets, enabling Branthwaite to beat Alisson with a tame shot.\n\nKlopp and his staff continued to argue that the officials were too readily giving Everton their free-kicks opportunities. The Liverpool manager even chastised one of his own staff, John Achterberg, for complaining too much. It mattered little. Liverpool were being suckered in, falling for all the traps in a manner reminiscent of Roy Evans' side succumbing to the mid-90s 'dogs of war'. As Evertonians celebrated, Liverpool's fans feared a classic derby failure of minds and hearts.\n\nThe higher stakes had to be a factor.\n\nFor Liverpool, anything but victory here was going to feel like a defeat. A draw here in the 2019 run-in was pivotal to Klopp failing to beat Manchester City. The same outcome would surely end their participation in the title race.\n\nThe only way out for Liverpool was to impose themselves and stop feeling persecuted by a raucous atmosphere which is compulsory on such evenings.\n\nWhen the visitors did so, there were chances galore. So continued a recent theme of Liverpool's front three failing to capitalise - Nunez, Diaz and Salah all guilty in the first half.\n\nThe jury is out on whether Pickford was making himself a hero or the beneficiary of Liverpool's carelessness, Nunez and Diaz striking straight at him when they had to score.\n\nSalah somehow fired hopelessly over the crossbar when six months ago he would have been lethal. This is where Liverpool's title challenge has faltered, beginning at Old Trafford. The more it continued, the more the strikers' ability to remain calm in intimidating surroundings was in question.\n\nDyche could sense safety within Everton's grasp. He has navigated the club through the choppiest waters without completely winning over the Gwladys Street, who have been more appreciative than enchanted by Dyche's contribution to date. A derby win is the means by which that changes.\n\nEverton retreated ever deeper, challenging Liverpool to overcome their attacking anxieties. Dyche could be confident the visitors did not have the ammunition, Salah's touch in particular deserting him. Most worryingly, he was outmuscled by Ashley Young - a second half substitute - to enable Dwight McNeil to force Alisson into a save from distance.\n\nFrom the subsequent corner, Calvert-Lewin's leap dwarfed Van Dijk and Everton were two-up.\n\nThere was a response from Liverpool as they poured forward but every attempt was blocked, and even when Pickford was beaten the post intervened as Diaz finally struck with venom and more accuracy.\n\nLike their title bid, Liverpool's reaction petered out.\n\nThey were dreaming of an Anfield quadruple a month ago. Now Everton are celebrating a dream double - their twin nightmare of relegation and a Klopp farewell title laid to rest.\n\nVan Dijk also drops not so subtle hints about the free-kicks Everton were awarded and the scheduling of an away game at West Ham at Saturday 12.30pm.\n\nPickford: \"You have to put the hard yards in, Dom up there grafting by himself. Team effort clean sheet again, and we keep building.\"\n\nCalvert-Lewin: \"It's what I've worked for and it's where I want to be [Being Everton's No 9]. Pressure is a privilege and I want to carry that. I've been here long enough to know what it means for the fans and what it means to me, it was a huge three points in the position we are.\"\n\nPickford: \"We can't ease off, got to keep pushing and working hard but enjoy tonight.\"\n\nPickford with one last save from a Salah volley, but that is that, both for the game and surely Liverpool's title hopes. They were wasteful in Everton's penalty and weak in their own, and the reaction to falling two goals down was pretty meek considering the stakes. Sean Dyche's team had to rely on Pickford, especially in the first 45 minutes, but were the more purposeful and aggressive team. Goodison roars at the final whistle, and Everton are all-but safe as a Premier League team for another season.\n\nLiverpool looking very flat, but they are still probing around the edge of Everton's defensive third but with no real threat. Diaz then concedes a free-kick moments after he feels he should have had a foul, and is shown a yellow. Mac Allister also booked for dissent. Goodison then rises to give Calvert-Lewin a standing ovation.\n\nThe home fans are signing: \"You lost the league at Goodison Park.\"\n\nLiverpool have a corner, it is Hail Mary time now. Branthwaite headed Tsimikas' delivery away, before Pickford was called into action. The England man tipped a dipping volley from Elliott over the bar. Impudent attempt, but Pickford always had the measure.\n\nJust FIVE minutes of stoppage time to play, and Everton have a free-kick in their own box.\n\nGarner wins Everton a free-kick just outside the Liverpool penalty area, and more time ticks away. 10 or 15 minutes ago there was still anxiety around Goodison, but the mood is jubilant now they can see the finish line. The songs have started and the Gwladys Street are on their foot. Young shoots over.\n\nCalvert-Lewin wins another free-kick on halfway. You always hesitate to write Liverpool off because they have scored so many late goals and pulled off so many turnarounds, but they look drained of belief. Klopp has his head bowed on the touchline. \"When it's just slipping away, you know\", says Gary Neville on comms.\n\nQuansah slides in on Doucoure and Goodison howls for a free-kick, but the referee waved played on. Everton win a throw via Godfrey. Liverpool's two players coming off are Robertson and Alexander-Arnold. That will increase the confidence levels among Evertonians, Liverpool's most creative player is off.\n\nEven Alexander-Arnold's technique is failing him now, skewing a shot from distance well over the bar. Klopp is preparing another couple of changes: Gomez and Tsimikas...not the most likely of goalscorers. Elliott floats another cross into the box, and once again Pickford claims. Everton's goalkeeper has been excellent.\n\nNot for the first time this evening, the ball drops for Salah in the box with minimal reaction time and his snap shot flies over. Doucoure stands up a cross for Harrison to attack, but on this occasion Van Dijk does enough to put him off. Ashley Young has been very solid since coming on at left-back.\n\nKlopp is sat down on the touchline, and Liverpool's attacking has started to become too telegraphed. Straight balls into the area which Everton can just line up behind. Doucoure leaves a bit on Mac Allister, it was a semi-kick out, but he got away with it. VAR checked and decided it was not a red card offence.\n\nEverton are sinking deeper, but they are backing themselves to repel crosses. This time the ball flicks off Robertson's head and behind for an Everton goal kick. Pickford in now hurry to take it. A change from Dyche: Gueye off for Onana. Gueye gets a great ovation from the Everton fans.\n\nSome Everton fans were watching between their fingers after that Diaz shot hit the post. One-way traffic now, but it is just not clicking for Liverpool when it comes to the final pass or shot. One of those scenarios where it currently feels like Liverpool could play all night without scoring, but if they scored one you'd fancy two and three could follow.\n\nLuis Diaz his the post! Wonderful effort cutting in from the left on his right foot, and his attempt cannoned off the inside of the woodwork to safety. One of those nights for Liverpool so far. Robertson lets Everton fans breathe again by clipping a floaty cross in which was an easy catch for Pickford.\n\nThe bounce of the ball has gone Everton's way tonight in their own penalty area, but they have earned that luck. Liverpool win a corner but Young clears after Van Dijk won the first contact. For once, Alexander-Arnold's cross into the box was poor. Robertson with a superb diagonal to find Salah but Everton deal with the all across goal.\n\nEverton were almost in for three but Liverpool produced a desperate last-ditch block. Calvert-Lewin has been too much for them to handle, when he is fit and firing he is a real threat. Everton then win successive corners, after Alexander-Arnold glances behind with no one behind him. Everton try to work the same routine, to the back post with Van Dijk blocked, and Alexander-Arnold heads behind again. Van Dijk is complaining to the referee.\n\nAnother chance! Tarkowski wins another header, but Branthwaite nodded wide. Think he was offside anyway.\n\nA little messy from Everton as they defend a corner, but the ball rolls through to Pickford. Szoboszlai goes down in midfield looking for a foul, but nothing doing.\n\nKlopp is making a triple change: Elliott, Endo and Quansah are on for Jones, Szoboszlai and Konate. Konate in particular has had a stinker, not often you see a like-for-like change at centre-back.\n\nWhat a position Everton find themselves in now, 13 years since their last win over Liverpool at Goodison. Three points would surely mean survival, given some of the softer fixtures to follow. Still plenty of time left for Liverpool, who need to throw the kitchen sink at this. They probably need three to keep their title hopes alive.\n\nWhat is the first thing you need to ensure on a trip to Goodison? Defend set-pieces properly, and once again Liverpool have failed. Everton's blockers were clever around Van Dijk, and it isolated Calvert-Lewin on Alexander-Arnold at the back post, and he powered a classic centre-forward's header home. That could have been Gray or Ferguson at that same end.\n\nWhat a hit from Dwight McNeil! Fully 30 yards out, the Everton winger caught a rasper with his left foot, but Alisson was always behind it and he tipped over for an Everton corner.\n\nDoucoure with a lung-busting run forward down the left, and he did ever so well to spread play for Harrison on the far side. He teed up Gueye for shot, but his effort was scuffed. Gueye feels the pass should have been better weighted.\n\nAt the other end, Diaz drives into the penalty area, and Salah sticks a leg out to connect with the low cross, but it rolls harmlessly to Pickford.\n\nCalvert-Lewin tried to chip Alisson from inside his own half when he had runners either side! He got the effort all wrong, and it was easy for the goalkeeper. Not what Everton needed as they try and withstand this pressure. Lovely, reversed chipped pass from Alexander-Arnold but Robertson was offside at the back post.\n\nLovely cross from Robertson , but Nunez could not get across the front and Branthwaite did well to defend. Branthwaite then charged out to block a Mac Allister cross from the resulting corner. Szoboszlai in time and space, running at the Everton defence, but he was indecisive once he entered the penalty area. Liverpool dominant.\n\nRoars of encouragement from the Goodison crown for Garner and Harrison who do well to wriggle their way out of a tight spot. Liverpool regain possession, and the pattern of this half is already set: Everton deep in their defensive shape and Liverpool trying to break them down.\n\nVan Dijk with a header straight at Pickford from a Robertson corner. Everton would be bitterly disappointed to concede a set-piece goal. I wonder if Klopp might consider introducing Endo to allow Mac Allister to use his vision further forward.\n\nAn eye-catching statistic as the second half resumes: this is the first time in over a decade that Everton have held a Premier League lead over Liverpool at Goodison Park.\n\nAshley Young on at left-back for Mykolenko, who has succumbed to that ankle roll. I seem to remember Jose Mourinho using Young against Salah at left-back for Man Utd.\n\nFor 40 minutes or so Everton brought chaos and Liverpool struggled to keep their calm, but there were some encouraging signs towards the end of the half that Jurgen Klopp's side were starting to gain more control and with it far more of a goal threat.\n\nEverton's direct style of play has certainly rattled the visitors and they deserved the lead Branthwaite gave them after Liverpool had failed to clear the ball from their box multiple times.\n\nHowever, having spent most of the half on the back foot, Liverpool began to crank up the pressure late in the first half and will feel they have created the chances to equalise. Nunez and Diaz were both denied by good saves from Pickford, but on both occasions they failed to direct their shots wide of the Everton goalkeeper who just had to stand his ground to make the save.\n\nEverton have started to look a little tired but Liverpool are still going to have to find another gear. Remember, they need to win this game, a draw does not feel like it will be enough for them in terms of the title race.\n\nA quite brilliant derby game, but I suspect hell for both sets of supporters. A strange game in that Everton were excellent for long periods, and Liverpool so shaky, yet Klopp's team could easily have scored two or three. Liverpool also finished the half in the ascendancy. Half-time came at the right time for Dyche and his players. They all need a slice of orange after putting a proper shift in.\n\nA promising Everton attack, but Calvert-Lewin was in an offside position. Backs against the wall once again for Everton, but Liverpool fail to find a telling pass around the Everton penalty area.\n\nIn true Klopp style, they look more dangerous immediately after winning the ball back. First, Szoboszlai teed up Salah for a blocked shot, before Robertson drove into the box and tested Pickford with a shot across goal. Everton's players starting to gasp for air now, they need the whistle.\n\nEverton have six minutes of first-half stoppage to endure. This is Liverpool's strongest spell of the half, finally sustaining possession in Everton's defensive third, but Pickford does well to come and claim Alexander-Arnold's cross.\n\nNow Salah shoots over the bar after the ball rebounded back to him from his own blocked shot. Salah slashed at those efforts. As well as Everton have played, Liverpool have had the chances to be at least level.\n\nAnother good save from Jordan Pickford! This time it was Diaz with a side-foot volley, in a similar position to the Nunez chance, and once again a Liverpool forward sent their shot straight at the goalkeeper. Mykolenko is back on, trying to limp his way to half time.\n\nPlay has stopped for a few minutes after Mykolenko suffered a horrible landing, twisting his ankle in such a way that Sky have decided not to show a replay. The defender is sat up and looking better, but you would think that is his race run.\n\nSky have now shown the replay, and his foot twisted back as he landed. The left-back is going to try and run this off.\n\nIt was just as well, all told, that referee Andrew Madley signalled that Jarrad Branthwaite's goal would stand. After the utter dejection at an earlier penalty being overturned, Goodison Park felt ready to tip over into outright mutiny otherwise. The lead is deserved: Liverpool are lacking any of their usual fluidity, often finding themselves outmuscled at set pieces.\n\nI thought that Branthwaite goal was going to be ruled out for offside and we would have been at risk of a riot inside Goodison Park. Instead, the home fans got to celebrate wildly, twice, as the centre back had just about managed to stay level with the Liverpool defensive line to win his first header back across goal\n\nIt's not a moment Allison will want to look back on as he dived over the ball but Liverpool had plenty of opportunities to clear the ball before that. They have not liked Everton's direct style at all. Dare I say it, but Jurgen Klopp's side don't like \"it up 'em\" on this evidence.\n\nNow Virgil van Dijk has been booked for rushing over to the referee. It has been startling to watch Konate and Van Dijk, who have a strong shout to be the league's best centre-back pairing, toil like this.\n\nA good Pickford save or a bad Nunez miss! It was slick interplay from Liverpool involving Salah, and Nunez had plenty of goal to aim at from no more of eight or nine yards out, but he blasted the ball straight at Pickford. These spurned chances are becoming a familiar sight for Liverpool fans.\n\nNunez's control lets him down in the box and Everton clear their lines. Klopp's team are not playing well, but have so many attacking threats on the pitch and there is a long way to go. Diligent defending from Harrison to track a run into his own box.\n\nThere was a long old VAR check on that goal, for offside against Branthwaite, but the goal stands. An almighty roar greets the decision, from a Goodison crowd who must have been fearing the worst as the seconds ticked by. Liverpool are in a game, and Everton deserve their lead.\n\nThat has been coming since the first few minutes. Liverpool have not won a header in their own penalty area, and could not clear the lines with the ball bouncing off Konate and across his own six-yard box. Branthwaite was on hand to squeeze the ball under Allison, and the ball trickled over the line, even if Calvert-Lewin poked the ball into the net to make sure. Terribly chaotic defending from Liverpool.\n\nThis is what you want for a derby game, full throttle football with tackles flying in everywhere and the crowd roaring encouragement from the stands. As they have said on Sky commentary, it's a throwback sort of game with Everton looking to be direct, whipping crosses in early and hitting long balls down the channels, looking to turn the Liverpool defenders so they are running back towards their own goal. Sean Dyche's side have created far more clear chances and look dangerous from set pieces too\n\nLiverpool look a little bit rattled. The one moment of class from the visitors was the pass from Alexander-Arnold to Salah that needed a brilliant clearance from Godfrey when it looked like a goal was certain.\n\nDarwin Nunez slips over and almost does the splits to the delight of the Goodison crowd. A very Darwin Nunez moment, but he is liable to score an overhead kick minutes later. Calvert-Lewin is causing Konate real problems in the air, the Liverpool defender is unsettled. Shades of what Kai Havertz did not him at the Emirates when Konate was sent off.\n\nNunez with a spin in behind that helps Liverpool win a corner, but Everton head clear Alexander-Arnold's inswinger. Liverpool come back with interest though, and win another corner but once again the home team defend. Gueye and Doucoure then do well to carry them up the pitch and win a throw.\n\nTarkowski wins another header in the Liverpool box but he could not find a blue shirt across the face of goal. Then it looked like Nunez was favourite to latch on to a ball over the top with Pickford stranded near the edge of the box, but the ball ran through to the Everton goalkeeper.\n\nLiverpool guilty of losing the ball in central midfield again, before Curtis Jones concedes another free-kick.\n\nSave by Alisson! Tarkowski won the header at the back post, directing it back across goal where Calvert-Lewin had the run on Mac Allister, but his header was straight at the goalkeeper. Another good opening for Everton, who have had four shots to Liverpool's two so far.\n\nLiverpool do not look stable defensively at the moment, despite having their first-choice back four on the pitch. Calvert-Lewin with a lovely flicked header back towards the edge of the box, but no Everton player read the situation. It would have been a shooting chance. Klopp will want his team to keep the ball for longer sequences.\n\nBoth teams look threatening when they go forward, but if Everton get into a shootout with Liverpool you would assume they come off worse. That was neat interplay from Everton though, and Gueye wins a free-kick in a dangerous crossing position. The midfielder let the ball run across his body and Mac Allister brought him down.\n\nMcNeil whipped it in to the back post, and Godfrey headed wide of the post. He really needed to get that back across goal.\n\nThis has been an explosive start to the game, and Liverpool are starting to come to the party.\n\nAlexander-Arnold picks out Salah with a delightful scooped pass into the tightest of spaces, but Godfrey saved the day for Everton by hooking clear after Salah poked the ball across goal.\n\nThen Everton force Alisson into kicking the ball out of play. Crazy stuff.\n\nTarkowski won a crunching tackle on halfway, and Calvert-Lewin was played in behind by a Harrison pass with the outside of his foot. The Everton striker got there before the on-rushing Alisson who brought him down, and the referee did not hesitate to point to the spot.\n\nBut replays show Calvert-Lewin was half-a-yard offside. The penalty is chalked off, and Alisson's yellow card is revoked. Boos at Goodison but that was the right decision, no doubt.\n\nNot entirely sure why the VAR check for offside took so long. It was pretty blatant, Calvert-Lewin looked about a foot offside on the first replay I saw. Warning signs for Liverpool though. Everton's desire to whip the ball in from the flanks quickly is causing problems, with Jack Harrison starting the game really well.\n\nSolid centre-forward play from Calvert-Lewin to protect the ball and win a foul on halfway.\n\nThen the first chance of the game falls to Everton! Branthwaite with a sweet diagonal pass crossfield to Harrison, and his inswinging cross was taken off the head of Calvert-Lewin by Konate. McNeil drove the ball back across goal and Doucoure connected, but he could not directed the ball towards goal from seven yards out or so.\n\nLiverpool look to reply in kind, and Everton scramble clear after a dangerous ball into their six-yard box.\n\nEverton win a throw on halfway after a 50:50 between McNeil and Alexander-Arnold. The first of many tonight you would think. Liverpool establish possession in their own half, and Everton are dropping off into two banks of four. The visitors look content to keep the ball and draw the venom out of the atmosphere. Liverpool play a searching diagonal towards Diaz but Pickford was off his line to claim.\n\nWe are under way. Everton get us going and look to go direct in the first few seconds.\n\nThe sound of the Z Cars theme greets the teams, followed by a chorus of boos for the Liverpool players. Everton's fans will be desperate to throw themselves into this game, but will their team give them cause to do so? They have to avoid conceding an early goal which would force them to open up.\n\nJurgen Klopp has said he doesn't enjoy the Merseyside derby games but he has enjoyed plenty of success in them, with the second highest win ratio of any Liverpool manager in these fixtures.\n\nBut you can see what he means, especially when they come at this stage of the season and Liverpool know they need a win to maintain their title challenge. It is a nasty, tricky, pothole filled fixture for his side.\n\nThis also feels like a dangerous time to be playing their neighbours, who have eased their relegation fears with the controversial win over Nottingham Forest last weekend. That has released some of the pressure around Goodison Park and manager Sean Dyche has managed to wind Klopp up on the touchline before. There was a memorable clash during lockdown when Klopp appeared to square up to the then Burnley manager before thinking better of it.\n\nA win for Everton this evening will be a giant leap towards Premier League survival. A win for Liverpool will ensure they keep pace with Arsenal and Manchester City in the title race.\n\nIt is perfectly poised, with far more than a city rivalry at stake. Sit back and enjoy. It has all the makings of a classic encounter and I predict it will become quite fractious too.\n\nBen Godfrey will be tested at right-back against Luis Diaz, but given Ashley Young's struggles against Forest it is no great surprise to see a change from Dyche in that position. Garner is preferred to Onana in midfield. Harrison and McNeil out wide promises supply for Calvert-Lewin.\n\nThat might just be Liverpool's strongest team, though Jota might have something to say about that. It is certainly their best back four with Konate and Robertson fit again. Klopp has left out Endo, probably because he expects to dominate possession.\n\nEverton XI: Pickford, Godfrey, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko, Harrison, Gueye, Garner, McNeil, Doucoure, Calvert-Lewin\n\nSubs: Keane, Onana, Danjuma, Virginia, Young, Andre Gomes, Chermiti, Warrington, Hunt\n\nLiverpool XI: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson, Jones, Szoboszlai, Mac Allister, Salah, Nunez, Diaz\n\nSubs: Gomez, Endo, Elliott, Tsimikas, Gravenberch, Clark, Kelleher, Danns, Quansah.\n\nCody Gakpo is absent because his partner has just gone into labour. So that's Gakpo and Jota missing from Liverpool's battery of attacking options.\n\nMohamed Salah could become the first player since Dixie Dean in 1932-33 to score two or more goals in both Merseyside derbies in a league season.\n\nHaving a bet on today's match? First take a look at the offers on these best betting sites.\n\nJurgen Klopp has never tasted defeat at Goodison Park and with the Premier League title on the line this would be no time to change that record as he takes charge of his final Merseyside derby.\n\nLiverpool bounced back from a rough week at home and abroad with a comfortable 3-1 win at Fulham on Sunday, which was also a good day for Everton who beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 in 'El Deductico'. That result pulled Sean Dyche's team five points clear of the relegation zone, with home games against Brentford and Sheffield United and a trip to Luton in their final five games.\n\nAt the other end of the table, Arsenal applied the pressure with a 5-0 win over Chelsea and it is up to Liverpool to respond. Victory would put Klopp's side level on points with Arsenal, though second on goal difference, and four points clear of Man City. City would have two games in hand, the first of which comes at Brighton tomorrow night.\n\nKlopp will be out Diogo Jota for a \"few weeks\" with a muscular injury. That means Liverpool are without possibly the deadliest finisher in their squad, after a run of games in which they have been extremely profligate in front of goal. Darwin Nunez, Mohamed Salah and Alexis Mac Allister started on the bench at Fulham, and will likely come back into the team this evening.\n\nEverton will assess Dominic Calvert-Lewin after he picked up a knock against Forest. Liverpool have had a stranglehold on this fixture, losing just one of their last 26 league meetings, with Everton failing to win at Goodison in 12 attempts. Everton have failed to score in the last four Merseyside derbies, while Liverpool are looking to record their 100th win in the history of the rivalry.\n\nFull team news on the way shortly.", "source":

This was his 19th derby and his first ever defeat at Goodison Park as well as just his second against Everton. Yet this will certainly hurt the most as it was seriously damaging to Liverpool's title hopes.\n\nThey now look all but over. Two slip ups are needed from Arsenal and Manchester City to stand a chance but neither look ready to stumble.\n\nBut the Reds have certainly tripped up. That's eight points dropped in just over a fortnight. This game might be seen as the end of their bid but their fall had already begun against Manchester United and Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Everton fans were loving it. Not only did this win move them one victory from being mathematically safe, they also got the added bonus landing a huge blow to their nearest rivals. They've only won once against them in 14 years and that was at an empty Anfield during Covid times.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored here for their first home win over their neighbours since 2010. The scorer of the second that night? Mikel Arteta. The Arsenal boss may have enjoyed this one as much.\n\nEverton outfought and outworked Liverpool almost everywhere on the pitch. They targeted them at set pieces and they got their reward. Everton are in the battle to stay up so you would expect them to put up a fight but Liverpool going for the title should have been more up for a scrap.\n\nWere you surprised by Liverpool's defeat? Have your say in the comments section\n\nToffees boss Sean Dyche should have started wearing the tracksuit ages ago. It's two wins in two with the casual attire. This was exactly the final Merseyside derby Klopp didn't want. It was frantic and foul-filled. Most of them by his side in the first half hour.\n\nIt was the eighth one and the sixth near the area which gave Everton what was a worthy lead in the 27th minute. Alisson poorly dealt with a low strike from Branthwaite as he scampered across goal and it squeezed in off the post.\n\nThe Kop keeper had earlier denied Calvert-Lewin from a header with a parried stop but he was poor for the goal.\n\nKlopp was animated on the touchline as he tried to orchestrate his side back into it.\n\nThey had chances at the end of the half but Jordan Pickford thwarted Darwin Nunez twice and Mo Salah scooped one over. Everton knew a third win in four games would move them eight clear of the bottom three with four games to go. Liverpool knew defeat would almost spell the end of their title hopes.\n\nSo the second in the 58th minute was huge at both ends of the table. Dwight McNeil tested Alisson with a long range effort that the Brazilian had to push over.\n\nFrom the resulting corner from the man who won it, came the Calvert-Lewin second as he rose at the back post and headed in amid awful defending from Liverpool. Goodison couldn't settle despite the lead. Luis Diaz hit the post for the Reds but a raft of changes from Klopp couldn't inspire a Kop comeback.\n\nOne of those subs was Harvey Elliott and he tried a long-range effort. But the brilliant Pickford tipped it over and finally the Toffees fans could enjoy a home win in the Merseyside derby for the first time in 14 years as they began to give Klopp a tune to remember them by.\n\nThe German has enjoyed some memorable Merseyside Derby moments but this won't be one.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Listen on Spotify , Apple podcasts or anywhere you get your podcasts\n\nDespite Liverpool's recent dominance in the Merseyside Derby, Jurgen Klopp's record at Goodison Park leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nOn Wednesday night, that must all change for the German. Yes, he is yet to lose a derby at the historic Merseyside ground. But the hoodoo that has haunted him here in the past has proved costly for his side.\n\nWith so much on the line this week, he cannot afford to drop more points against their neighbours across Stanley Park.\n\nAll things considered, this is a very tricky fixture for the Reds and perhaps not one that the outgoing manager would have wanted at this stage in the season, with a title chase also on the line.\n\nEverton also could do with a win. Their victory against Nottingham Forest seemingly gave them a bit of respite from the toils of their fight to break away from the clutches of the relegation zone. But they are in need of more points.\n\nJurgen Klopp has claimed that he will not miss the Merseyside Derby when he leaves Liverpool\n\nLiverpool travel to Goodison Park for a match that may have huge implications in the title race\n\nKlopp has seen his side draw five times against the Blues at Goodison since taking over\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Listen to our EXCLUSIVE interview with Phil Foden IAKO! - Nottingham Forest are making fools of themselves!

Play on Apple Spotify\n\nA victory tonight could further allay their fears of yet another fight for survival, but the ramifications that it could jeopardise the title hopes of their arch rivals would perhaps make sealing victory a little sweeter for the Toffees.\n\nKlopp knows this full well. The outgoing manager has struggled to win points here over the years and admitted that this fixture is one he won't miss when he leaves this summer.\n\nSince joining in 2015, Klopp has won twice at Goodison, but interestingly has seen his side draw to Everton on five occasions at the historic old ground. It is a far cry from Liverpool's dominance at home, with the Reds having won nine of their previous fixtures at Anfield while losing only once to a Carlo Ancelotti-led Everton side back in 2021.\n\nTonight, there is too much riding on this match for the Reds to be haunted by their Goodison woes once again.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool suffer fresh injury blow as Jurgen Klopp reveals Diogo Jota is OUT for the next two weeks... with the Portuguese set to miss crucial games against Everton and Spurs Advertisement\n\n'Around the derby is just pressure', the German told a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n'The pressure is higher so why should the joy be higher? You win it, great, but why should I miss the pressure around it? This time, when you're really playing for something, that's the pressure.\n\n'But when you are both not in a great moment, it's the one game you have to win, definitely. That kind of pressure - why would I miss that? It's not enjoyable.'\n\nFootball often goes out of the window in this fixture, which for 90 minutes divides families, friendships and an entire city. Derbies of years gone by have been decided on who wants it more - having descended into blood and thunder contests with seismic challenges, red cards and on field spats.\n\nIn the crunch end of the season, we can expect Arsenal and Man City to show no let-up in their bid to win the Premier League, which is why a win tonight for Liverpool is so important. Klopp's side must want to win more than Everton.\n\nAfter crashing out of Europe, Liverpool returned to thump Fulham 3-1 on Sunday afternoon\n\nThe Reds must win on Wednesday night to stay in keeping with Mikel Arteta's (left) and Pep Guardiola's (right) sides who are battling it out to win the Premier League title\n\nOver the years, the Merseyside derby has provided for some iconic moments in English football\n\nBut at Goodison, Liverpool have underwhelmed, with Everton notably denting the Reds' title hopes in 2019\n\nGoodison Park's ferocious atmosphere makes it one of the hardest away fixtures for any side, especially Liverpool\n\nEnglish football will lose a much cherished and historic old ground in Goodison when Everton move to their glinting new stadium on the Bramley Moore Dock\n\nTheir goalless draw at Goodison during the final three months of the 2018-19 campaign springs to mind ahead of the match. Having lost just once during the season to Man City, Liverpool had taken a commanding lead at the top of the Premier League table. They had stayed there for 13 consecutive matchweeks, before dropping points to Everton at Goodison Park.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool open talks with Feyenoord after identifying Arne Slot as the ideal candidate to succeed Jurgen Klopp... as Reds face \u00a38.5m compensation fee to land the Dutchman Advertisement\n\nIt was a tense affair, that saw Everton battle hard to hold Liverpool to a draw. They frustrated Klopp's side who were the more threatening side, but failed to convert their chances. Mohamed Salah notably came up short of his best, lacking some of the precision and ruthlessness in front of goal he has shown throughout his spell at Anfield.\n\nConcerningly for the Reds, Wednesday's match comes at a time where they have again lacked that cutting edge. Prior to their 3-1 victory against Fulham, Liverpool had endured somewhat of a goal drought, having not scored from open play in over six hours.\n\nThey were seemingly inspired to victory on Sunday thanks to a vintage performance from Trent Alexander-Arnold, a native to the city, who knows all too well what is riding on Wednesday's fixture, in terms of the title race and bragging rights over his club's rivals.\n\nTheir inability to score has also hindered them in several other visits to the cauldron that is Goodison Park. Despite going on to win the title after a largely dominant season, Liverpool could still not arrest a win off their rivals away from home during the 2019-2020 season - again failing to score. That day Alisson was the hero - stopping a close-range strike from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, while Tom Davies struck the woodwork.\n\nBut Klopp's woes away to Everton extend to more than just dropping points. The following season, the Calvert-Lewin would return to help Everton seal a 2-2 draw against the Reds. During that game, Liverpool would lose their star defender Virgil van Dijk for the remainder of the season, after Jordan Pickford's challenge on the centre back.\n\nPrior to their game against Fulham, the Reds have struggled to score goals from open play\n\nMohamed Salah (right) has also previously struggled to find the back of the net at Goodison\n\nAmid a lack of wins at Everton, Liverpool also suffered a huge blow at Goodison when Virgil van Dijk sustained a season ending knee ligament injury in 2020\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin scored in their fixture in 2020, helping Everton seal a late draw\n\nOnly this season has Van Dijk appeared to return to a semblance of his form prior to his ACL rupture - and has enjoyed an excellent 2023-24 campaign.\n\nOne thing Klopp can take solace in is that he is not the only Liverpool manager to struggle at Goodison. Brendan Rodgers' record attests to that. Liverpool have drawn 13 times at Goodison Park in the Premier League era - the most they have drawn away to any single club since 1992. Rodgers's would oversee four draws away to Everton during his time as Liverpool boss.\n\nConsidering the ferocious atmosphere the fans inside this rickety old stadium generate for this fixture - it's no wonder why Liverpool have struggled. Goodison is a tough place to come for any side, but when Liverpool arrive, the stadium descends into a bear pit.\n\n'They are always difficult games, especially there,' Klopp said on the Merseyside derby. 'At home it was - I am not sure if comfortable is the right way to say it - but more [comfortable] at least.'\n\nEx-Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers also struggled to secure victory at Goodison Park\n\nOn Wednesday, Klopp's side must block out their previous troubles at Goodison if they are to ultimately stay in the title race\n\nKlopp added: 'It is not too important what we had in the past. This is a super-important game for us, so whatever we did in the past is not too important for this game. We just should give it a proper try there and that's what we will do.'\n\nKlopp is right. Liverpool must forget the troubles they have endured at this stadium in the past. They must also block out any thoughts on their more recent struggles in front of goal and set aside the emotion that comes with this fixture.\n\nThe German will have learned a lot from his previous experiences in this iconic game over the years. But in his last visit to Everton, he certainly has his work cut out to exorcise his ghosts of Goodison past.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Two goals from set pieces ... there they are really strong.\n\nKlopp will now likely end his final season in charge with just the League Cup. Peter Byrne/PA/AP\n\n\"Then we created a lot and didn't score - I think that would have been possible in the first half. In the second half, the emotions, we're in a rush, not really clear enough and then we concede the second goal with a routine they've done all season.\n\n\"We knew exactly the ball would end up there, we just didn't defend it well enough. They had free kick after free kick ... but we were not good enough, that's what we have to admit. Absolutely.\"\n\n'Not the greatest moment'\n\nLiverpool also crashed out of the Europa League earlier this month, losing 3-1 on aggregate to Italian side Atalanta, while the team exited the FA Cup at the quarterfinal stage last month following a stunning extra-time defeat to Manchester United.\n\nOn Wednesday Liverpool was once again hampered by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez's profligacy in front of goal, while Mo Salah still looks a shadow of his former self.\n\n\"It's not the greatest moment we are in and we still have to play football games, so we have to fight through, you have to use your moments to get the momentum back,\" Klopp added.\n\n\"We tried but in the end it's not good enough. If you win, there are 500 reasons [why] and when you lose, it was just not good enough. That's how it is.\n\n\"We all know there were situations when we pretty much shot at [Everton goalkeeper Jordan] Pickford or kicked the ball over the goal, so there were good moments to turn the game around, but when you don't use them, it makes it really tricky.\"\n\nWhen pressed on whether he believed Liverpool was still in the title race, Klopp said he didn't know.\n\nEverton celebrated a first derby victory at Goodison Park in 14 years. Carl Recine/Reuters\n\n\"I can only apologize for today to the people,\" he said. \"Everybody who is with us knows how hard it [the defeat] is for us as well, but I know for the people it is especially hard.\n\n\"We should have done better and we didn't - and that's why we lost.\"\n\nLiverpool is reportedly advancing in its preparations for life after Klopp and has opened talks with Dutch club Feyernoord over the possibility of hiring Arne Slot as manager, according to British media.\n\nSlot, who has developed a reputation of developing young talents and an exciting brand of football, guided Feyernoord to the Dutch league title last season and the Dutch Cup this campaign, while also leading the team to the 2022 Conference League final.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType":

Liverpool trail the Gunners by three points, and hold just a one-point lead over Pep Guardiola's side despite playing two games more.\n\nMohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez and Alexis Mac Allister were among those restored to the starting lineup for the visitors, but it was yet another slow start as they struggled to cope with the aggression and intensity from those in blue.\n\nEverton thought they had an early penalty when Calvert-Lewin was brought down by Alisson and the referee pointed to the spot, only for a VAR review to show the striker was offside when played in.\n\nLiverpool did not make the most of that let-off though, and inside half an hour they were behind. A flurry of cheap free-kicks had enabled the hosts to regularly send the ball into the Liverpool box and it was no surprise that the goal from a set-piece. Branthwaite won the initial header, and Liverpool's bungled attempts to clear only presented the ball back into his path, with the centre-back squirming an effort under Alisson and over the line.\n\nKlopp's side improved from a very low bar towards the end of the opening 45 minutes, though wastefulness was again an issue. Nunez hammered straight at Jordan Pickford when clean through on goal, before Luis Diaz did similar when offered a big chance of his own.\n\nThe visitors stayed on the front foot immediately after the break, only to find a wall of blue shirts in their way. Curtis Jones and Dominik Szoboszlai had efforts charged down, and Klopp could only laugh on the touchline as that pressure was followed by a second Everton goal.\n\nSalah, enduring a torrid night, let the ball run under his foot and Liverpool broke, with Dwight McNeil's effort tipped over by Allison. The resulting corner was swung deep to the back post, where Calvert-Lewin rose highest to power a header home and give the Toffees real control.\n\nDiaz crashed an effort off the post as Liverpool pushed for a way back into the match, but those comeback hopes petered out as Everton appeared increasingly comfortable in ticking away the minutes, securing a result that almost certainly ensures there will be Merseyside derbies on the Premier League fixture list next season.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/ac2ae42960cfa994d12828add24da526", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

That result pulled Sean Dyche's team five points clear of the relegation zone, with home games against Brentford and Sheffield United and a trip to Luton in their final five games.\n\nAt the other end of the table, Arsenal applied the pressure with a 5-0 win over Chelsea and it is up to Liverpool to respond. Victory would put Klopp's side level on points with Arsenal, though second on goal difference, and four points clear of Man City. City would have two games in hand, the first of which comes at Brighton tomorrow night.\n\nKlopp will be out Diogo Jota for a \"few weeks\" with a muscular injury. That means Liverpool are without possibly the deadliest finisher in their squad, after a run of games in which they have been extremely profligate in front of goal.

Juergen Klopp's men are three points behind the Gunners (77) with four games to play.\n\nHolders Manchester City remain in the driver's seat on 73 points but with two games in hand, while Everton's victory has them breathing easier, eight points above the relegation zone in 16th.\n\nEverton were sharper from the start and won a penalty when Mr. Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Liverpool keeper Alisson only for it to be overturned by the VAR for an offside.\n\nYet it wasn't long before Mr. Branthwaite had the old stadium shaking in the 27th minute when he capitalised on poor defending from Liverpool, slotting home from close range after the Reds missed several attempts to clear the ball.\n\nMr. Alisson could not quite get his hands on the ball which rolled off the post and in.\n\nMr. Branthwaite is the first Everton player to score against Liverpool since Demarai Gray in a 4-1 league home loss in late- 2021.\n\nMr. Calvert-Lewin leapt to head home from a corner kick to double the Toffees' lead in the 58th minute, and while Liverpool have mounted some masterful comebacks this season, Everton held strong to hand Mr. Klopp, who is leaving his role at the season's end, his first defeat at Goodison in his final derby.\n\nLiverpool kept Everton keeper Jordan Pickford busy in the dying minutes as he leapt to bat Harvey Elliott's shot over the crossbar and then dived to save a shot from Reds talisman Mohamed Salah while Everton manager Sean Dyche looked at his watch in frustration, desperately wanting the final whistle to blow.\n\nIt was joyful bedlam when it finally did, with Everton's faithful serenading the team off the pitch.\n\nWhile Liverpool, who had 77% possession and seven shots on target to Everton's six, won the League Cup earlier this season, the Premier League is the final trophy up for grabs for the Reds after they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Europa League. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With Lose Against Everton | African Examiner", "body": "(AFRICAN EXAMINER) - Everton secured their first win in a Merseyside derby at Goodison Park since 2010 to leave Liverpool's Premier League title aspirations in ruins after a 2-0 defeat on Wednesday.\n\nDefeat leaves Jurgen Klopp's men still three points adrift of leaders Arsenal and only one point in front of defending champions Manchester City, who have two games in hand.\n\nGoals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin took Everton eight points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nThe Toffees now look certain to extend their 70-year stay in the English top flight despite being deducted eight points on two charges of breaching financial rules.\n\nKlopp had never lost on his previous eight visits to Goodison but his final taste of the Merseyside derby was a bitter one.\n\nHopes of a glorious goodbye for the German after a nearly nine-year reign that has transformed the club's fortunes are fading fast.\n\nAccording to reports, Feyenoord boss Arne Slot is being lined up as Klopp's successor and the past few weeks have exposed weaknesses that need addressing in a huge summer for the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nThe Reds have won just one of their last four league games and have also bowed out of the FA Cup and Europa League in recent weeks.\n\nKlopp made six changes after resting a number of key players for Sunday's 3-1 win at Fulham but did not get the response he desired.\n\nSlow starts have been a recurring factor as Liverpool's quest for four trophies has unravelled.\n\nBuoyed by their weekend win over Nottingham Forest to pull clear of the relegation zone, Everton are a side transformed from the one that went 13 Premier League games without a win between December and April.\n\nThe home side thought they had a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Alisson Becker but VAR intervened to save the visitors as the Everton striker was offside.\n\nAlisson then clawed away a Calvert-Lewin header and Ben Godfrey nodded wide as Liverpool struggled to cope with Everton's threat from set-pieces.\n\nMore comical defending from the Reds led to the opener on 27 minutes.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister's mishit fell perfectly for Branthwaite and the defender's effort went in off the post despite Alisson's best efforts.\n\nGoing behind woke Liverpool from their slumber and only a combination of wasteful finishing and Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's lead until half-time.\n\nDarwin Nunez blasted straight at the England number one when clean through before the Uruguayan teed up Luis Diaz to fire too close to Pickford.\n\nMohamed Salah's loss of form has come at the worst possible time for Liverpool's title challenge and the Egyptian sliced another good opening well over the bar.\n\nLiverpool were camped in the Everton half after the break, yet the hosts pulled further clear just before the hour mark from another dead ball.\n\nCalvert-Lewin was afforded a free header at the back post to power home Dwight McNeil's corner.\n\nLiverpool's night was summed up when Diaz's powerful effort came back off the post with Pickford finally beaten.", "source": {"uri": "africanexaminer.com", "dataType":

Everton eight points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nThe Toffees now look certain to extend their 70-year stay in the English top flight despite being deducted eight points on two charges of breaching financial rules.\n\nKlopp had never lost on his previous eight visits to Goodison but his final taste of the Merseyside derby was a bitter one.\n\nHopes of a glorious goodbye for the German after a nearly nine-year reign that has transformed the club's fortunes are fading fast.\n\nAccording to reports, Feyenoord boss Arne Slot is being lined up as Klopp's successor and the past few weeks have exposed weaknesses that need addressing in a huge summer for the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nThe Reds have won just one of their last four league games and have also bowed out of the FA Cup and Europa League in recent weeks.\n\nKlopp made six changes after resting a number of key players for Sunday's 3-1 win at Fulham but did not get the response he desired.\n\nSlow starts have been a recurring factor as Liverpool's quest for four trophies has unravelled.\n\nBuoyed by their weekend win over Nottingham Forest to pull clear of the relegation zone, Everton are a side transformed from the one that went 13 Premier League games without a win between December and April.\n\nThe home side thought they had a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Alisson Becker but VAR intervened to save the visitors as the Everton striker was offside.\n\nAlisson then clawed away a Calvert-Lewin header and Ben Godfrey nodded wide as Liverpool struggled to cope with Everton's threat from set-pieces.\n\nMore comical defending from the Reds led to the opener on 27 minutes.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister's mishit fell perfectly for Branthwaite and the defender's effort went in off the post despite Alisson's best efforts.\n\nGoing behind woke Liverpool from their slumber and only a combination of wasteful finishing and Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's lead until half-time.\n\nDarwin Nunez blasted straight at the England number one when clean through before the Uruguayan teed up Luis Diaz to fire too close to Pickford.\n\nMohamed Salah's loss of form has come at the worst possible time for Liverpool's title challenge and the Egyptian sliced another good opening well over the bar.\n\nLiverpool were camped in the Everton half after the break, yet the hosts pulled further clear just before the hour mark from another dead ball.\n\nCalvert-Lewin was afforded a free header at the back post to power home Dwight McNeil's corner.\n\nLiverpool's night was summed up when Diaz's powerful effort came back off the post with Pickford finally beaten.\n\nBut it was Klopp who was crestfallen come the final whistle as he looks set to depart Anfield with just one Premier League title to his name.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki",

We should have done better and we didn't and that's why we lost,\" Klopp said.\n\nThe loss keeps Liverpool three points behind league leader Arsenal in second place and one ahead of defending champion Manchester City, which is in third and has two games in hand on both of its rivals.\n\nKlopp had spoken last week of needing perfection to win his second title at the club. But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted,\" Klopp said.\n\nKlopp had dominated this fixture since taking over at Anfield in 2015, winning nine of the past 16 derbies before Wednesday's match.\n\nIt was a different story on what could be his last visit to Goodison Park as an opposition manager as Everton produced a high-octane performance that Liverpool struggled to contain from the start.\n\nStatistics showed Everton won 75% of all duels in the opening half hour.\n\nAfter just six minutes, Liverpool was grateful for VAR as it escaped an early penalty when Alisson brought down Calvert-Lewin in the box and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot. The decision was overturned because of an offside in the build up.\n\nEverton's pressure was made to count when it took the lead in in the 27th. Liverpool's defenders repeatedly failed to clear the danger from a free kick and Branthwaite's shot squirmed through the hands of Alisson and off the post before crossing the line.\n\nAgain there was an agonizing wait for a VAR check, but on this occasion there was no reprieve for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz had the chance to level before the break, but was denied by the legs of Jordan Pickford from close range.\n\nLiverpool came out with more intent for the second half without forcing Pickford into serious action before conceding a second goal.\n\nAgain the visitors failed to deal with a set piece when Dwight McNeil swung a deep corner to the far post and Calvert-Lewin rose unmarked to head home.\n\nLiverpool came close to pulling one back in the 69th, but Diaz's effort came back off the post.\n\nManchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat last-place Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry in the FA Cup semifinals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in its bid qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz in each half at Old Trafford. But Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st and and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited is up to sixth in the standings, 13 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa.\n\nPALACE SAFE\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle.\n\nPalace is on 39 points -- 14 clear of 18th-place Luton, which can only pick up a maximum of 37 if it wins its last four games of the season.\n\nIt was Palace's third-straight win to erase fears of being relegated. Defeat saw Newcastle drop to seventh.\n\nBournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 at Molineux through Antoine Semenyo's first-half strike.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, that very much hasn't been the case in Merseyside derbies since J\u00fcrgen Klopp became Liverpool manager. Klopp has transformed the Reds into one of the best teams in Europe during his nine years at Anfield, whilst Everton have largely been fighting relegation or at least in the bottom half of the table in recent years. And the Merseyside derbies in the last decade have reflected that.\n\nWednesday's showdown at Goodison Park will be Klopp's last ever Merseyside derby. And there are huge repercussions on the game. Liverpool can't afford to lose any more ground on Manchester City in the title race, with full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold recently admitting the Reds have to be faultless in their last five Premier League games to have a shot at the title. Everton will no doubt be fired up to derail their rivals, but Liverpool fans can take some confidence in Klopp's excellent record against the Toffees. Just one defeat in 18 matches, and unbeaten at Goodison Park.\n\nAs can be seen above, Liverpool have lost just one Merseyside derby from 18 games against Everton whilst Klopp has been in charge. That defeat came in a 2-0 loss at Anfield in 2021, without fans during the bleak covid times, meaning Klopp has never lost a game at Goodison Park. 11 wins from those 18 fixtures sees a record of 2.17 points per match for the German against the Toffees. However, the German has drawn six games against Everton, with five of those matches at Goodison Park, so there may be more hope for Sean Dyche's team taking a point on Wednesday night.\n\nIn those derbies, Klopp's Reds have scored 30 goals (1.67 goals scored per game) and conceded just 10 (0.56 goals conceded per game). Liverpool's biggest margin of victory from those matches actually came back in 2016 in Klopp's first derby - a 4-0 win at Anfield thanks to goals from Divock Origi, Mamadou Sakho, Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge. However, in the game at Goodison Park in the Premier League last season the score finished level with a 0-0 draw. Shutting out the Reds may perhaps be Dyche's best chance of taking something from Liverpool this season - only the top three have conceded less goals than Everton in the Premier League this season.\n\nIn Klopp's entire career as manager, from all the opponents he has faced 10 times or more, he boasts the very best record against Everton. As you can identify in the table above, just six teams have faced Klopp 10 times or more and only beaten him once. But from those six sides no one has played against Klopp more than Everton have (18). When you take into consideration the emotion of the fixture, it's an incredible record. One man who has played a big part in Klopp's success from this fixture, is Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah, who has seven goals against Everton - only Ian Rush and Steven Gerrard have score more in this fixture.", "source": {"uri": "transfermarkt.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "transfermarkt.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Rush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ian Rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divock_Origi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divock Origi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sturridge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Sturridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamadou_Sakho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mamadou Sakho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tmssl.akamaized.net/images/foto/big/klopp-spotlight-1713878501-134907.png?lm=1713878521", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

They made it to the 75th minute before conceding, doing well for themselves all things considered and falling by just a respectable 2-0 scoreline given the situation.\n\nThis game should be much more open. Everton haven't scored on Liverpool in five straight league matches, dating back to Demarai Gray's goal near the end of the first half in a 4-1 defeat way back in 2021. That run will end eventually, and if they can't score on this chaotic Liverpool side that looks exhausted late in the season, when will they? Plus, two of the league's worst finishers in Beto and Dominic Calvert-Lewin may both miss the match with injuries, which will allow others to take the opportunities in front of net.\n\nWe don't normally recommend anytime goal scorer selections on a player with minus odds, but this is just too good to pass up. Mo Salah is rested and ready to go having played just 16 minutes off the bench against Fulham on Saturday, and he's taking on one of his favourite opponents in Everton.\n\nSalah loves a Merseyside derby, with six goals against Everton in their last seven Premier League meetings, including three in their last two games. The Egyptian is great on extra rest as well -- he scored a goal and assisted three against Sparta Prague last month after coming off the bench in two straight games prior.\n\nAdditionally, Salah is Liverpool's penalty taker, and Everton are quite mistake-prone in their own 18-yard box -- they've conceded eight penalties this season, second-most in the Premier League, and were lucky not to concede any of three potential penalties last time out against Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe Reds do at times look as if they are exhausted at the end of the season, embodying the body language of manager Jurgen Klopp who appears completely out of steam and justified in taking his upcoming sabbatical. Yet there are signs they are ready to finish the season strong up front.\n\nWith Diogo Jota back to lead the line, Liverpool looked quality against Fulham, testing Bernd Leno on a number of occasions and putting half of their 14 shots on frame. The Reds don't lack for chance creation, and they seemed to put their recent struggles scoring from open play to bed in that match as well. There's also a possible focus on goal differential down the stretch of the season, knowing Arsenal hold an eight-goal advantage but also face a difficult run-in of fixtures. Jota is down for another two weeks with a new hip injury, cruelly, but they should still manage to keep the level up.\n\nAgainst Everton recently, Liverpool have managed just six goals in their last four games against the Toffees, but they collected over 2.0 xG in all four of those matches totaling 8.82, suggesting a reversion to the mean is on hand soon.\n\nTo cap it all off, referee Andy Madley has overseen 14 Liverpool fixtures in his refereeing career, a collection from which the Reds are unbeaten, including his two most recent matches in 2024 being a 4-1 Liverpool win over Luton Town and a 4-0 Liverpool victory over Bournemouth.\n\nThis match will stream exclusively on Peacock in the United States, as rights-holders NBC Sports have decided instead to televise the match between Crystal Palace and Newcastle on USA Network.\n\nIn Canada, Fubo is the exclusive broadcast rights-holder for the Premier League this season, with every match from August to May streaming live on the platform. Fubo also hold the exclusive broadcast rights to Serie A games in Canada, while other leagues like MLS, Bundesliga, and La Liga can be found throughout the season as well.\n\nThis midweek Premier League match will be broadcast domestically in the UK on Sky Sports platforms.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The first one we somehow defended three times but in the end we put it on a plate. Branthwaite didn't even kick the ball properly but the ball rolls over the line.\n\n\"After that we had our best period. We created big chances but didn't score. Each situation we missed gave Everton momentum even more. Second half as well, not good enough. Then you concede the second goal. I think everybody who is with Everton saw that goal already 20 times. That's their routine, everybody knows they put the ball there. The player is completely free.\n\n\"Obviously not the most inspired performance of all times. I really feel for the people, I am really sorry for that.\n\n\"We never lost here before and that feels really different. I really apologise for that. It was absolutely unnecessary but it happened.

hopes.\n\nEverton produced a strong home performance to claim a 2-0 victory in the Merseyside derby to dent Liverpool's Premier League title hopes.\n\nThe Toffees opened the scoring in the 27th minute when Jarrad Brainthwaite's strike squirmed under Alisson Becker.\n\nSean Dyche's side survived a period of Liverpool pressure at the end of the first period, before they doubled their advantage courtesy of Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 58th-minute header.\n\nAlthough Luis Diaz rattled the post, the Reds were unable to claw their back into the contest, ensuring Everton could celebrate their first home victory in a Merseyside derby since October 2010.\n\nAfter suffering his first defeat at Goodison Park, Jurgen Klopp's hopes of winning a league title in his final season as Liverpool boss are now hanging by a thread.\n\nThe Reds are three points adrift of leaders Arsenal, while they are just one point better off than Manchester City, who have two games in hand.\n\nBranthwaite nets crucial opener\n\nThe hosts thought they had been presented with an early opportunity to take the lead when referee Andy Madley pointed to the spot after Alisson had brought down Calvert-Lewin.\n\nHowever, the home faithful's joy turned to frustration as replays showed Calvert-Lewin had strayed into an offside position, denying Everton the chance to go to the penalty spot.\n\nJust over 10 minutes later, James Tarkowski met Dwight McNeil's floated free-kick to nod the ball across goal for Calvert-Lewin to attack, only for Allison to make an instinctive stop to keep the headed effort out.\n\nEverton's relentless pressure ultimately paid off just before the half-hour mark when Branthwaite netted his third goal of the season after Liverpool failed to clear their lines from a free-kick.\n\nThe ball kindly broke to the Everton defender, who managed to squeeze his effort under Alisson and over the line.\n\nAfter getting off to a slow start, Liverpool carved out their first meaningful chance in the 35th minute when Darwin Nunez found himself one-on-one with Jordan Pickford, only to fire his effort at the England international.\n\nAs the first half neared its conclusion, Nunez then knocked the ball into the path of Luiz Duiz, who drew a strong stop from the Everton goalkeeper.\n\nMore to follow.\n\nID:542101:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect3367:No Data Analysis info",

Then Calvert-Lewin raced through a hesitant Liverpool defence and was brought down by Alisson as he took Jack Harrison's clever pass round the Liverpool keeper.\n\nReferee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot only for VAR, after a lengthy delay, to rule correctly that Calvert-Lewin was offside as Harrison played the pass.\n\nBut Everton's bright start continued with Ben Godfrey heading wide from McNeil's free-kick. Moments earlier Godfrey had made a vital interception to stop Curtis Jones and Nunez from converting Salah's cross.\n\nLiverpool played into Everton's hands by conceding a number of free-kicks in dangerous areas. From one of them James Tarkowski headed straight at Alisson, who also saved from a Calvert--Lewin header.\n\nSuch was Everton's upbeat start, it was no surprise when they took the lead after 26 minutes . Liverpool failed to deal with another McNeil free-kick and when Alexis Mac Allister mis-kicked the ball straight to Branthwaite he fired home, despite Alisson's scrambling efforts to keep the ball out.\n\nCalvert-Lewin followed up to make sure but the ball was already over the line so the goal was awarded to Branthwaite.\n\nKlopp became increasingly agitated on the touchlines and had a constant dialogue with fourth official Simon Hooper but Liverpool finally got their game together towards half-time and could have been level.\n\nNunez fired a good chance straight at Pickford who also saved from Diaz while the out of touch Salah fired high over the bar.\n\nNo doubt fired up by some choice words by Klopp, Liverpool came out for the second half with more intensity but it was Everton who increased their lead with Calvert-Lewin climbing above Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold to score with a towering far post header from McNeil's corner in the 57th minute.\n\nKlopp responded by making a triple substitution after 63 minutes with Ibrahima Konate, Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis replaced by Jarell Quansah, Wataru Endo and Harvey Elliott.\n\nIt almost brought an immediate reward with Diaz striking the inside of the far post with a thunderous shot.\n\nLiverpool piled on the pressure towards the end with Pickford tipping over Elliott's volley but they Everton held firm putting bodies on the line and making numerous blocks and interceptions.\n\nAt the final whistle delirious Everton fans taunted Liverpool by chanting \"you lost the League at Goodison Park.\n\nMore significantly the win virtually ensured they will stay in the top tier after another traumatic campaign.\n\nEverton (4-4-1-1): Pickford 9; Godfrey 8, Tarkowski 8, Branthwaite 9, Mykolenko 6 (Young 46, 6); McNeil 8,

Do they really want to win the league?\n\n\"We are fighting, there are games after tonight, but play like we did overall in the game like today... not winning challenges and giving the ref an opportunity to give a free-kick like he did many times, then you have no chance to win a title.\n\n\"It's a tough one and we need to do much better against a side that's [fighting] relegation.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSo now Jurgen Klopp has another reason why he will not to miss the Merseyside derby. His last trip to Goodison Park was his worst. On a night when Everton had multiple reasons to celebrate, they saw off Klopp with the result that all but secures them a 71 consecutive season of top-flight football and may in effect finish off Liverpool's title challenge. \"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" chorused the Evertonians. Klopp has caused them untold pain over the last eight years. Finally, he was given a taste of how painful Merseyside derbies can be for the losers.\n\nKlopp has seen Sadio Mane and Divock Origi snatch victory in these fixtures. He had to watch Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin assume the mantle of the heroes of half of a divided city. Klopp spent his final night on the Goodison Park touchline haranguing the fourth official Simon Hooper, a picture of frustration. As Everton's identity was intensity, a strangely lacklustre Liverpool performance was laced with miskicks and mistakes. This was not the way he had hoped to bade farewell to a rivalry which, while he said he has not enjoyed, he has dominated.\n\nThis was just Klopp's second defeat in 19 derbies. A succession of Everton managers have lived and laboured in Klopp's sizeable shadow but now Sean Dyche finds himself in distinguished company with Carlo Ancelotti as the only ones to beat the German. As the Italian's victory came in lockdown, Branthwaite's opener made it the first time a crowd had even seen Everton lead since 2013. Their previous triumph at Goodison was so long ago, in 2010, that one of the scorers may be a title-winning manager now. Mikel Arteta could certainly savour his old club's long-awaited triumph.\n\nFor Klopp, it was a first loss at Goodison. If results have been one-sided in his tenure, at the last, the one side was Everton. They displayed many of the traits the Liverpool manager wants: the fervent commitment, the fast start, the energy to galvanise the crowd. Goodison's penultimate derby was a raucous affair, Everton attacking with urgency and defending with defiance. For the most part, Liverpool had no answer to them.\n\nAfter 13 matches without a victory, Everton have won three in four. They have improving as Liverpool are regressing. Klopp had restored six of his premier players to the starting 11 but Liverpool played better with the weakened team he fielded at Fulham. They looked cowed: as against Atalanta and Crystal Palace at Anfield, Liverpool suggested their race this season - and under Klopp - is run. They have gone from formidable to fragile, from peaking to losing form, individually and collectively. Not for the first time of late, they were poor in both penalty boxes. In part, that reflected on Darwin Nunez, who squandered a wonderful chance to equalise. An exception may be made for Alisson, whose saves included a brilliant effort to claw away Calvert-Lewin's close-range header.\n\nYet his night started with a reprieve after Andrew Madley awarded a penalty to Everton. Calvert-Lewin raced on to Jack Harrison's delightful pass and was upended by Alisson. If Nottingham Forest felt VAR had intervened too infrequently at Goodison on Sunday, it did here: replays showed the striker was offside.\n\nHe was, though, a constant, producing as dynamic a display as he has done in the last couple of injury-hit years. Few get the better of Virgil van Dijk quite as emphatically. He gave Everton an aerial menace, but so did their giant centre-backs as Liverpool were subject to a set-piece bombardment. Pressure eventually told. Alexis Mac Allister, often the coolest of characters, sliced his attempted clearance to Branthwaite. He shot and while Alisson took the pace off it and deflected it on to the post, it rolled over the line, with Calvert-Lewin sliding in to make sure.\n\nA resurgent Calvert-Lewin was to get his goal anyway: after a 23-game drought, it was a third in four when he headed in Dwight McNeil's far-post corner. The winger was excellent, too, marrying expert delivery into the box with harrying of Liverpool. James Tarkowski and Branthwaite excelled at penalty-box defending and, as Everton ended with just 23 percent of possession, it mattered not; nearly all of the outstanding performers were in blue or, in Jordan Pickford's case, green.\n\nThe goalkeeper made terrific saves when Nunez, with all the goal to aim for, drilled a shot at his thighs, when Luis Diaz volleyed, when Harvey Elliott tried his luck from 20 yards, when Mohamed Salah connected sweetly deep into added time. He was beaten only by the Colombian, curling a shot against the post after an electric surge. But too many of Liverpool's pivotal performers were poor: Mac Allister was off colour, Salah subdued even when his immediate opponent in the second half was Ashley Young. It felt Klopp raised the white flag when he substituted Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nAnd on a day when Liverpool moved closer to appointing Klopp's successor, Everton all but ensured that Arne Slot will not inherit the reigning champions.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Liverpool, Arsenal and now Forest.

'I really feel for the people,' he said. 'We never lost here (under Klopp) and it feels really different. I really apologise for that.'\n\nAsked if the title race is over, Klopp said: 'We need a crisis at Manchester City and Arsenal and need to win football games.\n\n'We are not safe (to qualify for) the Champions League as well so we should just play better football.

(They should) ask if they really gave everything and do they really want to win the league?\n\n'And honestly, we are fighting and still have games after tonight but I think if we play like the game we did today, not winning challenges and giving the referee the opportunity to give a free-kick like we did many times then we have no chance to win the title.'\n\nClub legend Jamie Carragher also blasted the Reds performance and said: 'It's not acceptable, certainly when Liverpool are going for the title.'\n\nFellow Sky Sports pundit Wayne Rooney added: 'Again we are hearing about 12.30 kick-offs (moans about Saturday's games at West Ham).\n\n'Those Liverpool players should be wanting to go tomorrow because when you lose a derby game you want the games to come quick.\n\n'Get on with it, it's part of your jobs.'\n\nEverton boss Sean Dyche, meanwhile, was delighted with his team's display, one of the best of his tenure at Goodison Park.\n\n'I'm delighted for the Evertonians and the old-school Toffees who support us,' he said. 'Thank you to the fans, they were terrific tonight and Sunday.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite gave Everton a richly-deserved lead in the Merseyside derby\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin doubled the advantage for the home side in the 58th minute\n\n'I asked them to give their lot and we will try to give it back.\n\n'When I got here, the negativity around the whole club and situation...

And United fans were revelling in the fact that Liverpool's hopes of winning the league in Klopp's final season have taken a blow, despite the fact they remain 21 points behind.\n\nWhile the Reds were losing the Merseyside derby, United were hosting bottom of the league Sheffield United in a game they won 4-2. And after Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored Everton's second goal, United fans could be heard chanting: \"Jurgen's cracking up\".\n\nAnd in his post-match press conference, Klopp pinpointed Liverpool's 2-2 draw against United earlier this month as the moment where things started to go wrong. Since that game, Liverpool have crashed out of the Europa League to Atalanta and suffered surprise defeats to Crystal Palace and Everton.\n\n\"We need a crisis at City and Arsenal, and need to win football games, because if they start now losing all the games and we do what we did tonight, nothing changed,\" Klopp said. \"And we are not safe in the Champions League as well so we should just play better football.\n\n\"You can see we are in a rush in front of the goal, you can see that. It's long ago but I blame a little bit the United game for it; that many chances and you play really good but you don't get anything for it. That's really bad. Since then, we create but we don't score often enough and that doesn't help.\n\nLiverpool were beaten 2-0 by Everton in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday\n\n\"It's not like in a situation like that you don't score and then just [think], 'Ah, forget it, who cares?' You cannot act like you scored 15 goals in the last two games or whatever. You can see that and that's a problem.\n\n\"It's always like this: you have to fight through these periods, it was never different. People asked me already about mentality. The mentality has different aspects. It's not a problem of attitude. The boys want; nobody is doing anything like that on purpose.\n\n\"It's my job to bring them into a situation that they feel confident to do it. With that part, I'm responsible for everything that happened tonight, so it's not that I feel great. But that's the most tricky part of football obviously, and in the moment it didn't work out and now we have to keep trying.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

'I really feel for the people,' he said. 'We never lost here (under Klopp) and it feels really different. I really apologise for that.'\n\nAsked if the title race is over, Klopp said: 'We need a crisis at Manchester City and Arsenal and need to win football games.\n\n'We are not safe (to qualify for) the Champions League as well so we should just play better football.

(They should) ask if they really gave everything and do they really want to win the league?\n\n'And honestly, we are fighting and still have games after tonight but I think if we play like the game we did today, not winning challenges and giving the referee the opportunity to give a free-kick like we did many times then we have no chance to win the title.'\n\nClub legend Jamie Carragher also blasted the Reds performance and said: 'It's not acceptable, certainly when Liverpool are going for the title.'\n\nFellow Sky Sports pundit Wayne Rooney added: 'Again we are hearing about 12.30 kick-offs (moans about Saturday's games at West Ham).\n\n'Those Liverpool players should be wanting to go tomorrow because when you lose a derby game you want the games to come quick.\n\n'Get on with it, it's part of your jobs.'\n\nEverton boss Sean Dyche, meanwhile, was delighted with his team's display, one of the best of his tenure at Goodison Park.\n\n'I'm delighted for the Evertonians and the old-school Toffees who support us,' he said. 'Thank you to the fans, they were terrific tonight and Sunday.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite gave Everton a richly-deserved lead in the Merseyside derby\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin doubled the advantage for the home side in the 58th minute\n\n'I asked them to give their lot and we will try to give it back.\n\n'When I got here, the negativity around the whole club and situation... I've been talking about changing the narrative, just as we change it we get points taken off!\n\n'It's not a done deal, there's endless amounts of work to be done.

Man United survives another scare - New Delhi Times - India's Only International Newspaper - Empowering Global Vision, Empathizing with India", "body": "Jurgen Klopp's hopes of a dream send-off were left in tatters after a 2-0 loss at Everton dealt a major blow to Liverpool's Premier League title bid on Wednesday.\n\nGoals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin at Goodison Park meant Klopp tasted a bitter defeat in his last Merseyside derby before standing down at the end of the season.\n\n\"I can only apologize for today to the people. We should have done better and we didn't and that's why we lost,\" Klopp said.\n\nThe loss keeps Liverpool three points behind league leader Arsenal in second place and one ahead of defending champion Manchester City, which is in third and has two games in hand on both of its rivals.\n\nKlopp had spoken last week of needing perfection to win his second title at the club. But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted,\" Klopp said.\n\nKlopp had dominated this fixture since taking over at Anfield in 2015, winning nine of the past 16 derbies before Wednesday's match.\n\nIt was a different story on what could be his last visit to Goodison Park as an opposition manager as Everton produced a high-octane performance that Liverpool struggled to contain from the start.\n\nStatistics showed Everton won 75% of all duels in the opening half hour.\n\nAfter just six minutes, Liverpool was grateful for VAR as it escaped an early penalty when Alisson brought down Calvert-Lewin in the box and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot. The decision was overturned because of an offside in the build up.\n\nEverton's pressure was made to count when it took the lead in in the 27th. Liverpool's defenders repeatedly failed to clear the danger from a free kick and Branthwaite's shot squirmed through the hands of Alisson and off the post before crossing the line.\n\nAgain there was an agonizing wait for a VAR check, but on this occasion there was no reprieve for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz had the chance to level before the break, but was denied by the legs of Jordan Pickford from close range.\n\nLiverpool came out with more intent for the second half without forcing Pickford into serious action before conceding a second goal.\n\nAgain the visitors failed to deal with a set piece when Dwight McNeil swung a deep corner to the far post and Calvert-Lewin rose unmarked to head home.\n\nLiverpool came close to pulling one back in the 69th, but Diaz's effort came back off the post.\n\nManchester City plays Brighton on Thursday.\n\nUNITED SCARE\n\nManchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat last-place Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry in the FA Cup semifinals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in its bid qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz in each half at Old Trafford. But Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st and and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited is up to sixth in the standings, 13 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa.\n\nPALACE SAFE\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle.\n\nPalace is on 39 points -- 14 clear of 18th-place Luton, which can only pick up a maximum of 37 if it wins its last four games of the season.\n\nIt was Palace's third-straight win to erase fears of being relegated. Defeat saw Newcastle drop to seventh.\n\nBournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 at Molineux through Antoine Semenyo's first-half strike.", "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New

I can only apologise for today to the people. Everybody who's with us knows how hard this was for us as well. We should have done better but we didn't.\"\n\nJarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored in a 2-0 victory that will not soon be forgotten by the Everton faithful at Goodison Park, who serenaded the visitors with \"You lost the league at Goodison Park\" after the final whistle.\n\nIt was the Toffees' first home derby win in more than 13 years and prevented Liverpool from climbing level with Arsenal at the top of the league table.\n\nKlopp's men are three points behind the Gunners (77) with four games remaining in the much-loved manager's tenure with the team. Holders Manchester City remain in the driver's seat on 73 points but with two games in hand.\n\n\"Obviously very disappointed with a lot of things. We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted. Two goals from set pieces. We created a lot but didn't score. We were in a rush, not really clear enough. But we were not good enough, that's what we have to admit, absolutely.\n\n\"Of course I didn't expect that today but it happened anyway. Obviously it's not the greatest moment we are in. In the end it's not good enough. When you win you have 500 reasons. When you lose, it's just not good enough.\"\n\nKlopp could only shake his head about Calvert-Lewin's 58th minute goal from a corner kick, saying Everton have had that set piece in their play book all season and his players were prepared for it.\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk was blunt in his assessment, telling Sky Sports \"We have to do much better.\n\n\"If we play like today we have no chance to consider ourselves in the title (race).\"\n\nLiverpool travel to West Ham United on Saturday.

If you win, there are 500 reasons [why] and when you lose, it was just not good enough. That's how it is.\n\n\"We all know there were situations when we pretty much shot at [Everton goalkeeper Jordan] Pickford or kicked the ball over the goal, so there were good moments to turn the game around, but when you don't use them, it makes it really tricky.\"\n\nWhen pressed on whether he believed Liverpool was still in the title race, Klopp said he didn't know.\n\n\"I can only apologize for today to the people,\" he said. \"Everybody who is with us knows how hard it [the defeat] is for us as well, but I know for the people it is especially hard.\n\n\"We should have done better and we didn't - and that's why we lost.\"\n\nLiverpool is reportedly advancing in its preparations for life after Klopp and has opened talks with Dutch club Feyernoord over the possibility of hiring Arne Slot as manager, according to British media.\n\nSlot, who has developed a reputation of developing young talents and an exciting brand of football, guided Feyernoord to the Dutch league title last

Eriksson fulfils his dream of coaching Liverpool as Fernando Torres scores\n\nJurgen Klopp's final Merseyside derby as Liverpool coach couldn't have gone any worse. Liverpool's Premier League title hopes were dealt a huge blow by their rivals from across Stanley Park as Everton secured a vital 2-0 win at Goodison Park.\n\nIt was a result that nobody saw coming. Liverpool, despite their title charge stuttering in recent weeks, were still expected to dispatch an Everton team that conceded six goals to the current iteration of Chelsea, who could have conceded six away to Arsenal on Tuesday.\n\nSean Dyche likely never have dreamed the week since that defeat to Chelsea would have been so good. Not only did the Blues defeat relegation rivals Nottingham Forest, but in beating Liverpool they secured three additional points that nobody expected.\n\nIt took 30 minutes for the opening goal to arrive for the hosts, with Jarrad Branthwaite on hand to pounce on a rebound inside the penalty area. The defender rifled home a shot from close-range, although there was a subsequent VAR check.\n\nVAR informed Andy Madley that there could have been an offside in the build-up, although the review determined that this wasn't the case and the goal was allowed to stand.\n\nDarwin Nunez's season has been one of missed chances. Another was to follow just five minutes after Everton's opener when the Uruguayan collected a fine pass inside the penalty area but his tame shot was straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nLiverpool almost drew level with the last kick of the first-half. Luis Diaz made space inside the penalty area and he curled a shot towards the bottom right corner, however Pickford was able to parry the ball wide.\n\nLiverpool didn't look like a Klopp team for much of the match. While not picked by many to finish atop the standings before the start of the season, they were firmly in the title race, however their late-season collapse has been surprising.\n\nEverton had a chance through Dwight McNeil just before the hour, however his long-range effort hit the underside of the crossbar via a slight touch from Alisson Becker.\n\nEverton, though, managed to double their advantage through a Dominic Calvert-Lewin header. The English forward was able to run into the penalty area and perform a great leap above Liverpool's defenders and Alisson had no chance.\n\nLiverpool will leave Goodison Park knowing that their title hopes have been greatly hurt, as they now sit points behind Arsenal with four matches remaining. Manchester City sit four points back of the Gunners, but with two games in hand.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Madley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Madley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/5e61c7a7e076cb8618f408ec873f5adc/crop/0x0/2044x1363/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/04/24/17139912734513.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The strongest XI Klopp could field would surely be too much for an Everton team humiliated by Premier League laughing stock Chelsea a matter of weeks ago.\n\nInstead, as the euphoric Toffees put it upon the final whistle: \"You (could have) lost the league, at Goodison Park.\"\n\nFrom the very first whistle, there was only one team really pressing high, first to every ball, roared on by a Stanley Park crowd fully behind their team. The boys in blue were a class above.\n\nIt was breathless stuff, from a team who looked down at out a matter of weeks ago on a club-record Premier League winless streak. Goodison can turn toxic very quickly when things go bad, but conversely, when things are going well, there are few stadiums in the country who create an atmosphere on par with anything a 1990s trip to Galatasaray could conjure.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucoure could have scored inside three minutes, before five minutes later, Everton thought they had won a penalty, only for Dominic Calvert-Lewin to be judged offside as he was brought down by Alisson.\n\nFrom every set piece, Liverpool defended crosses like Dracula. The team with the most goals this season from set pieces knew what to do every time they won the free-kick, and the visitors just wilted.\n\nAfter already causing chaos with several long, lofted cross to the back post, Everton made one count to instigate delirium on the blue half of Stanley Park. The defending was poor, as a startled Ibrahima Konate sliced his clearance straight to Jarrad Branthwaite, with the England defender squeezing the ball past Alisson to, remarkably, give Everton the lead in a Merseyside derby at Goodison for the first time in nearly 11 years.\n\nHaving taken the lead, Everton naturally retreated a little too far, inviting Liverpool pressure, with Darwin Nunez, the player now with the most shots in the Premier League this term, and Luis Diaz denied by identical Jordan Pickford saves before the break.\n\nOn the whole, however, Everton remained that one step ahead. A woeful Salah attempt ballooned over the bar and a Virgil van Dijk caution for wagging his finger in the referee's direction summed up the Red's woes in the first half.\n\nKlopp needed a Churchillian speech during the interval to rouse his weary troops to keep his hopes of the ultimate victory this term alive, but there was no fighting on any beaches, only further surrender from Liverpool in the second half.\n\nA second from Calvert-Lewin was not against the run of play. The marking, or lack thereof, was the only incongruous element to the game-clinching header.\n\nLiverpool pressed, Luis Diaz hit a post, but you never felt it was going to come to anything. Heads had dropped, in complete shock.\n\nIt is not over yet. Even Manchester City will likely drop some points. But enough to let Liverpool in at the very last? You wouldn't bet your house on it.

Two goals from set pieces ... there they are really strong.\n\n\"Then we created a lot and didn't score - I think that would have been possible in the first half. In the second half, the emotions, we're in a rush, not really clear enough and then we concede the second goal with a routine they've done all season.\n\n\"We knew exactly the ball would end up there, we just didn't defend it well enough. They had free kick after free kick ... but we were not good enough, that's what we have to admit. Absolutely.\"\n\n'Not the greatest moment'\n\nLiverpool also crashed out of the Europa League earlier this month, losing 3-1 on aggregate to Italian side Atalanta, while the team exited the FA Cup at the quarterfinal stage last month following a stunning extra-time defeat to Manchester United.\n\nOn Wednesday Liverpool was once again hampered by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez's profligacy in front of goal, while Mo Salah still looks a shadow of his former self.\n\n\"It's not the greatest moment we are in and we still have to play football games, so we have to fight through, you have to use your moments to get the momentum back,\" Klopp added.\n\n\"We tried but in the end it's not good enough. If you win, there are 500 reasons [why] and when you lose, it was just not good enough. That's how it is.\n\n\"We all know there were situations when we pretty much shot at [Everton goalkeeper Jordan] Pickford or kicked the ball over the goal, so there were good moments to turn the game around, but when you don't use them, it makes it really tricky.\"\n\nWhen pressed on whether he believed Liverpool was still in the title race, Klopp said he didn't know.\n\n\"I can only apologize for today to the people,\" he said. \"Everybody who is with us knows how hard it [the defeat] is for us as well, but I know for the people it is especially hard.\n\n\"We should have done better and we didn't - and that's why we lost.\"\n\nLiverpool is reportedly advancing in its preparations for life after Klopp and has opened talks with Dutch club Feyernoord over the possibility of hiring Arne Slot as manager, according to British media.\n\nSlot, who has developed a reputation of developing young talents and an exciting brand of football, guided Feyernoord to the Dutch league title last season and the Dutch Cup this campaign, while also leading the team to the 2022 Conference League final.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The home side certainly started on the front foot.\n\nLiverpool themselves, though, should have been ahead in the 10th minute when a superb pass from Trent for Salah looked like a certain goal in the middle but neither Nunez or Jones could get on the end for a tap in.\n\nLiverpool were doing themselves no favours, giving away free-kicks around the box and needed a good save from Alisson to keep out Calvert-Lewin's header.\n\nIt was no surprise, then, when an eighth foul in the opening half hour eventually led to Everton's opener. Liverpool defended the set piece awfully and centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite put the home side ahead.\n\nThe 22nd time this season that Liverpool conceded the first goal of the game.\n\nNunez missed a glorious chance for an equaliser on 35 minutes, showing a complete lack of composure in front of goal and just blasting his shot at Pickford.\n\nLuis Diaz then fired straight at Pickford, albeit a more difficult chance, as Liverpool's forwards continued to show their lack of clinical finishing.\n\nA minute later, Salah scuffed a shot then smashed the follow up over. Absolutely no composure or ruthlessness.\n\nHalf time: Everton 1-0 Liverpool\n\nLiverpool started the second half slightly better, at least able to control the game more and push into the final third.\n\nBut it was no surprise when Everton doubled their lead off another set piece, Calvert-Lewin with a free header just before the hour.\n\nDiaz, one of the few players to come out of the game with any credit, struck the woodwork - but any comeback never looked remotely likely.\n\nTwo final subs, bringing on Tsimikas and Gomez, showed Klopp had given up.\n\nKlopp had lost just one of his 18 matches against the Blues - a behind-closed-doors game at Anfield in February 2021 - but ends his Liverpool career with just two wins in eight attempts at Goodison.\n\nKlopp's farewell has turned into a horror movie. 'You lost the league at Goodison Park' sand the home fans but the truth is Liverpool have never looked good enough to win the title.\n\nEverton: Pickford; Godfrey, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko;

But Sean Dyche's Everton will do their cross-city rivals no favours.\n\nExpect no quarter to be given in the final Merseyside showdown of the season.\n\nHere are the latest match odds for Everton vs Liverpool from our favourite football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nAfter a horrendous run of 13 Premier League matches without a win, Everton finally got three points in their recent 1-0 victory over Burnley on April 6th.\n\nIn good old fashioned typical Everton style, Sean Dyche's men followed that up with a 6-0 loss at Chelsea on April 15th.\n\nThey have since won their second match in 16 with Sunday's controversial 2-0 win over fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest at Goodison Park.\n\nSo, with two wins in their last two home matches, could there be a better time for Everton to host their local rivals from across Stanley Park?\n\nThe Reds have had a sticky patch of their own in recent weeks. The rot seemed to start with the 4-3 loss to Manchester United in the FA Cup 5th Round.\n\nJurgen Klopp's team let the Red Devils off the hook a second time when they could only manage a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in the Premier League on April 7th.\n\nWhat followed for Liverpool was even worse, with the Reds losing 3-0 at home to Atalanta in the Europa League and 1-0 at home to Crystal Palace in the Premier League.\n\nThe two Premier League games without a win handed the advantage in the title race back to Manchester City. As a result, every match is now a must-win cup final for Liverpool, and dropping points is just out of the question.\n\nMan City may have a slip in them. And Liverpool can add to the pressure on the blues by claiming another three points ahead of City's return to Premier League action against Brighton on Thursday.\n\nWe can only see Liverpool claiming all three points.\n\nFind our best bets for Everton vs Liverpool below. All our odds for the bets are from the best football betting sportsbooks, as per our expert reviews. Odds in our football betting tips are also subject to change.\n\nLiverpool failed to keep a clean sheet yet again when they faced Fulham in the Premier League last Sunday.\n\nSince their 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest at the beginning of March, the Reds have only managed one clean sheet, and that was in last Thursday's 1-0 win away at Atalanta.\n\nEverton aren't exactly what we would call prolific in front of goal. But they create chances and have scored in their last five Premier League matches at Goodison.\n\n\u26bd Back both teams to score and Liverpool to win at 17/10 with Spreadex \u26bd\n\nDiogo Jota has been playing himself back into form and fitness following his most recent injury layoff.\n\nOn Sunday, the former Wolves striker got his comeback goal in the Reds' 3-1 win over Fulham.\n\nJota was instrumental in Liverpool's win, registering three shots, two of which were on target. We expect him to make an impact against the Toffees.\n\nThis match is a Merseyside Derby. They are notorious for being high-octane occasions with plenty of boots flying and cards brandished.\n\nAnd with so much on the line for both teams, expect this match to be as fiercely contested as ever.\n\nBoth sides to pick up 30 or more booking points is 15/8. That means a minimum of three yellow cards each. And with a red card always a good possibility, a bet on plenty of cards looks like a sensible option.\n\nFor help with a gambling problem, call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 8020 133 or go to www.gamstop.co.uk to be excluded from all UK-regulated gambling websites.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dean_etheridge@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Dean Etheridge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/everton-vs-liverpool-betting-preview-the-sun.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1500&h=1000&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-06", "textStart": 621, "textEnd": 630}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 742, "textEnd": 752}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-07", "textStart": 1339, "textEnd": 1348}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Instead, they were beaten up by Sean Dyche's belligerent Everton who were simply more up for the fight.\n\nA raucous Goodison Park got behind its side from the outset and the Toffees responded. Dyche's men came out of the blocks fast, didn't let their visitors settle and set about claiming another three points to take them closer to safety with no shortage of purpose.\n\nWhen Jarrad Branthwaite found the net in the 27th minute, it was richly deserved. The video assistant referee had already stepped in to overturn a penalty for the hosts - rightly, due to offside - but Everton didn't take a step back, instead they doubled down and continued to push.\n\nLiverpool had their moments, a strong end to the first half their best period of the game, with Jordan Pickford called into action a couple of times, making a particularly fine stop to deny Luis Diaz.\n\nBut they didn't return from the half-time break with the same intensity and 13 minutes into the second half, Dwight McNeil's inswinging corner reached the far post, where Dominic Calvert-Lewin - in his best Everton performance for some time - leapt unmarked and powered his header into Alisson's net.\n\nLiverpool would throw men forwards and created chances. They managed plenty of shots. Their xG was higher and they had more touches in the opposition penalty area than their hosts.\n\nBut they didn't deserve anything more than the defeat they suffered. The faces of Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, substituted with just over five minutes of normal time to go, told the story as they sat down on the bench.\n\nTheir race, and Klopp's hopes for a final taste of silverware at Anfield on May 19, may just have gone up in smoke.\n\n1. The early fight\n\nSimply put, it was lost by Liverpool.\n\nFor the opening half hour, Everton were running harder, jumping higher and winning the 50-50s. And the 40-60s. Even the 30-70s.\n\nWhile Jurgen Klopp was berating fourth official Simon Hooper on the touchline, his opposite number can only have been delighted with how his side imposed themselves on this game. They weren't going to let Liverpool ease into it and dictate the tempo. They turned up the heat and Liverpool struggled to handle it. They were naive, weak and, given the amount of silly fouls they gave away in their own half, rather stupid.\n\nBranthwaite's opener rather summed it all up. The visitors didn't deal with the first ball, were beaten to the second and third, Konate's sliced clearance was panicked, and while a sprawling Alisson did his best, he couldn't keep it from going underneath him and squirming over the line.\n\n2. Mr. Calvert-Lewin, nice to see you again\n\nIn a different universe, one where he hasn't suffered numerous injury issues and remains at his 2020-21 best, Euro 2024 would see Dominic Calvert-Lewin as back up to Harry Kane.\n\nInstead, he's got just 12 goals in his last 63 Premier League appearances - across three seasons coming into tonight - and is nowhere near. But on this night, maybe he rediscovered a little something.\n\nEverton's early aggression and physicality was epitomised by their No.9. He rattled both Virgil Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate, holding strong and standing firm, enjoying the physical battle, winning fouls and free-kicks, getting his side up the pitch and looking as sharp as he's looked in his long time.\n\n\"I wouldn't go so far as to say they've been beat up,\" declared Gary Neville on Sky Sports commentary. \"But they've been ruffled. Harassed.\"\n\nThat changed in the second half to: \"He's beating Liverpool's centre-halves up. He's on fire.\"\n\nCalvert-Lewin's goal was him at his best in the penalty area, a towering header after a prodigious leap at the far post.\n\nPerhaps, indeed hopefully, after an almost cursed last two-and-a-half years, the 27-year-old is finally starting to trust his body again. If that's indeed the case, and we start seeing this Calvert-Lewin on a more regular basis once more, it'll be huge for Everton for the rest of this season and beyond.\n\n3. Mo back, no bang\n\nKlopp brought Mohamed Salah back into his attack, but the Egyptian hasn't been int the best form recently and that continued here.\n\nKlopp stated after the second leg in Bergamo that he was \"not concerned\" by Salah's recent form. That's despite only one goal from open play in his last seven games and a number of games where he just hasn't quite looked like himself.\n\nHe had chances here and had more shots in the game than anyone else on the field. However, too often they were scuffed, or wayward, and he couldn't produce the kind of clinical moment which has been a regular feature during his record-breaking time at Anfield.\n\nFor him, perhaps more than any other, a very disappointing night.\n\n4. Tigerish Garner\n\nThe former Manchester United youngster has grown in importance in recent weeks for Everton and he again had a fine game here.\n\nHe uses the ball well, closes down opponents with vigour, puts his foot in and wins tackles and isn't bad with a dead ball either.\n\nToo often this season Everton have lacked balance in midfield, but Garner and Idrissa Gueye have found a nice little partnership which both shields the defence diligently while has the ability to spring quick counters.\n\nGarner was up for the battle against Liverpool's midfield trio and was the star pick in that area.\n\n5. Klopp's final failure\n\nJurgen Klopp had never lost a Merseyside derby in the Premier League. He has now.\n\nAnd with his unbeaten record at Goodison, a second Premier League title has likely gone too.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

For the first time in 14 long years, Everton emerged victorious against their local rivals at Goodison Park. Victory will taste all the sweeter for Sean Dyche's team with their top-flight status almost certainly secured at the expense of Liverpool's title chances.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" sang the home crowd as they rejoiced in a deserved Everton victory, an outstanding Everton performance and the best night of Dyche's reign. Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals that consigned Liverpool to a hugely damaging defeat.\n\nEverton were fired up and Goodison responded in kind. The old ground pulsated as Dyche's team performed with an intent, intensity and quality that has been absent too often this season. Calvert-Lewin, an injury doubt on the eve of the game, led the line superbly. It was no coincidence that the supply to the centre forward was vastly improved too. Jack Harrison and Dwight McNeil delivered the service that Calvert-Lewin craves while working tirelessly to help Idrissa Gueye and James Garner assert control in midfield. Liverpool were rattled and vulnerable long before Branthwaite gave Everton a richly deserved lead.\n\nLiverpool were missing both Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo, the latter joining the injured striker on the sidelines after his partner went into labour hours before kick-off. They were also missing composure for long periods of the first half, although it may be more accurate to say Everton refused to allow them to have it.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 spurned the first good chance of the derby when turning McNeil's low cross wide from close range. Branthwaite instigated the move with a pinpoint diagonal ball that turned the Liverpool defence and sent Harrison scampering away from Andy Robertson.\n\nHarrison was also involved in an incident that threatened serious repercussions for the visitors' night. The winger put Calvert-Lewin through on goal with a delightful cross with the outside of his foot. The striker nudged the ball around Alisson and was sent sprawling by the Liverpool goalkeeper before he could convert into an unguarded net. The referee Andy Madley immediately pointed to the penalty spot and showed Alisson a yellow card, to the fury of the home crowd. Their mood deteriorated further when VAR found that Calvert-Lewin was offside when receiving Harrison's delivery. No penalty and no yellow card.\n\nThe reprieve did not shake Liverpool out of their pedestrian approach. Ben Godfrey launched himself into a vital challenge to prevent Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez or Curtis Jones converting a first-time cross from Mohamed Salah, but Everton remained in the ascendancy until the final 15 minutes of the first half. Godfrey headed wide when well placed at a McNeil free-kick. Another McNeil free-kick found its way to Calvert-Lewin via James Tarkowski but Alisson saved the striker's close-range header.\n\nIt was third time lucky for McNeil free-kicks when another needless Liverpool foul, this time Jones on Gueye, presented the winger with one more opportunity to worry the visiting defence. The initial delivery was cleared as far as Tarkowski, who hooked the ball back across the penalty area to Harrison. His first-time touch teed up Godfrey and, though his shot was blocked, the rebound fell invitingly for Branthwaite lurking unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box. The defender's low shot squirmed under Alisson, rolled against the inside of a post and trickled in. There was another VAR check for offside against the goalscorer but, after a lengthy delay, Everton were not denied for a second time.\n\nNow Liverpool responded. Klopp's side finally began to control possession and stretch the Everton defence. Jordan Pickford, previously untroubled, saved from N\u00fa\u00f1ez when the Uruguay international was played through by Salah. The Everton goalkeeper also denied Luis D\u00edaz with his legs after N\u00fa\u00f1ez turned provider. N\u00fa\u00f1ez created a clear opening for Salah too but, having scuffed his initial shot against Branthwaite, Liverpool's leading goalscorer skied the rebound wastefully.\n\nEverton also mounted fierce resistance in the face of Liverpool's belated pressure. Branthwaite and Gueye threw themselves in the way of goalbound shots. Tarkowski dominated his penalty area to repel numerous crosses.\n\nThe pattern continued after the restart but, from their first attack of note, Everton unearthed the luxury of a second goal. McNeil stung Alisson's fingertips with a powerful drive from 25 yards. From the resulting corner, taken deep by McNeil, Calvert-Lewin soared into a gap left by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk to head into the bottom corner.\n\nMcNeil was close to making it three when Harrison dispossessed Wataru Endo, a Liverpool substitute, on the edge of the area. His well-placed shot was deflected wide. Liverpool, in desperate need of a way through, peppered the Everton area with crosses but struck a royal blue shirt all too frequently or were instantly closed down when they did have sight of goal. D\u00edaz did eventually beat Pickford with a shot that curled in from the left but it smacked the inside of the far post and bounced away. \u00adPickford also denied Harvey Elliott and Salah late on

Everton have scored 34 goals, Liverpool have scored 75. That tells you everything. If this game goes to anything like form, Liverpool will win.\n\n\"What I would say is, first 20 minutes of the game, if Everton can set a tempo that changes the rhythm and then puts Liverpool out of their stride... If after 15 or 20 minutes Liverpool are starting to boss the game, I'm telling you, Liverpool get all three points.\"\n\nEarle seems more confident of a Reds victory than many of the club's supporters, who know historically how tricky an away derby can be, irrespective of where the teams sit in the league table.\n\nThink back to how Everton held us to a goalless draw during the 2018/19 season when we took 97 points from a possible 114 in the Premier League (and still came second), repeating the feat a year later when we were on the brink of being crowned champions with a final total of 99 points.\n\nHopefully tonight will be more like the December 2021 visit to Goodison Park when we were 2-0 up inside 20 minutes on our way to a 4-1 romp, seizing upon a mutinous atmosphere as the home fans didn't hide their contempt for then-Toffees manager Rafael Benitez.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Empire of The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_togher@empireofthekop.com", "name": "Liam Togher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Earle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Earle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben\u00edtez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://icdn.empireofthekop.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/earle-everton-liverpool.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Liverpool's title chances ended with a knowing smile after a Dominic Calvert-Lewin header.\n\nIt doesn't take much for the Goodison Park crowd to turn on their own, and the name of the game for Liverpool, as always at the home of their Merseyside rivals, was to win duels, pass the ball quickly and to not give fouls away. Klopp's side did the opposite.\n\nThe Reds boss said he issued the typical warning to his players about the Everton set pieces ahead of kick-off, and presumably selected Ibrahima Konate over Jarell Qansah in a bid to combat the home side's prowess from corners and free-kicks. Those cautionary measures had no effect.\n\nIt didn't matter which Everton player was on the end of a ball into the box - James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Ben Godfrey, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Abdoulaye Doucourse - they won every header.\n\nNow, we're aware that we've essentially listed giants there, but Liverpool have Konate, Van Dijk and Darwin Nunez, and anyone else should be able to block or prevent physically superior players from getting to the ball.\n\nThe deliveries from Dwight McNeil were decent, but nothing particularly special; it appeared to come down to the Everton players wanting it more, which in a must-win game in a title race is hardly mentality monster confirmation.\n\n\"Daniel. Calvert. Lewin.\" as he will now forever be known after Gary Neville's Man of the Match announcement, was consistently outmuscling and outmanoeuvring Konate while Liverpool's midfielders were either beaten to second balls or caught in possession. Liverpool also gave daft free-kicks away: often 50/50 calls that went in Everton's favour.\n\nCurtis Jones was among the Liverpool players to vent his frustration on the pitch having conceded the free-kick for Everton's opener, as Klopp chewed the fourth official's ear off over the soft fouls on the touchline. But it was all so naive.\n\nBranthwaite won the first header from McNeil's deep delivery and Everton again got to the ball first when it was recycled, before some penalty box pinball ended with an assist for Konate and a goal for Branthwaite, whose shot slipped under Alisson.\n\nEverton had by that point already had a penalty overturned for offside and had missed a couple of very presentable chances from further set plays. They were all over Liverpool in every metric other than possession, and Sean Dyche quite reasonably puts very little value on keeping the ball for keeping the ball's sake.\n\nLiverpool don't do that either, and had more than enough chances having gone behind to win this game and keep their title hopes alive. Barn doors and banjos spring to mind.\n\nMohamed Salah sliced, shanked and miscontrolled his way through 90 minutes, Darwin Nunez opted to hit blast one shot from about six yards out straight at Jordan Pickford, who could hardly have looked smaller with the goal gaping around him, and Luis Diaz hit the post with a lovely effort in the second half but missed a far easier chance in the first.\n\nHad Diogo Jota not been injured and Cody Gakpo's wife not been in labour, Liverpool probably win this game. Given their displays against Fulham (Jota and Gakpo's, not Jota and Gakpo's wife), they would surely have been starting ahead of Nunez and Salah, who have scored three goals between them in the last seven Premier League games and looked either knackered, out of form, or both, and in Salah's case, seemingly halfway to Saudi Arabia.\n\nLiverpool have collected an incredible 27 points from losing positions this season, and for a while - at the end of the first half and start of the second - it felt as though the first goal was coming before the inevitable second. But Everton got a corner, Calvert-Lewin headed in unchallenged, Klopp smiled, and that was that.\n\nThe best Klopp could muster from his bench to turn the game on its head was Harvey Elliott, Wataru Endo, Qansah, Joe Gomez and Kostas Tsimikas. Having watched his starters toil for an hour, and lacking in substitute firepower, Klopp knew the game was over and - barring something miraculous - so too are Liverpool's title hopes.\n\nThey've surpassed expectations this season by staying in the race this long. We'll save the full lionising of Klopp at Liverpool for now, but the work he's done to rebuild his team and have them challenging is remarkable.\n\nBut they are quite clearly the third best team in the Premier League, and will finish in the position they deserve. Everton will finish lower than their football has merited this season after the points deductions, but they will almost certainly still be a top flight team next season, and what a way to (all-but) confirm it.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_ford@football365.com", "name": "Will Ford", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The Toffees out-fought Liverpool and were a constant threat from set-pieces, with goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin both coming from dead-ball situations.\n\nIt is a result that leaves Liverpool relying on significant favours elsewhere, trailing Arsenal by three points and with a one-point advantage over Manchester City, who have two games in hand.\n\nThe Gunners, who hammered Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday, travel to face rivals Tottenham this weekend, while City have a potentially tricky trip to Brighton on Thursday night, but Klopp could not put a positive spin on his side's title ambitions.\n\n\"They must come in a very bad moment, Arsenal and City,\" Klopp told Sky Sports when asked if Liverpool were still serious contenders.\n\n\"It didn't look yesterday like that [when Arsenal beat Chelsea]. I don't know, I can only apologise for today to the people.\n\n\"Everybody who is with us knows how hard it is for us as well, but I know it's for the people especially hard. We should have done better, we didn't and that's why we lost.\"\n\nLiverpool made a slow start to the match, with Everton only denied an early penalty after a VAR review found Calvert-Lewin was offside before he was brought down by Alisson.\n\nThe visitors conceded a regular stream of cheap free-kicks, enabling Everton to play to their strengths and keep putting the ball in the Liverpool box, where Branthwaite and James Tarkowski won almost every header.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed,\" Klopp said. \"We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted.\n\n\"Two goals from set pieces... there they are really strong.

Man United survives another scare", "body": "LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- Jurgen Klopp's hopes of a dream send-off were left in tatters after a 2-0 loss at Everton dealt a major blow to Liverpool's Premier League title bid on Wednesday.\n\nGoals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin at Goodison Park meant Klopp tasted a bitter defeat in his last Merseyside derby before standing down at the end of the season.\n\n\"I can only apologize for today to the people. We should have done better and we didn't and that's why we lost,\" Klopp said.\n\nThe loss keeps Liverpool three points behind league leader Arsenal in second place and one ahead of defending champion Manchester City, which is in third and has two games in hand on both of its rivals.\n\nKlopp had spoken last week of needing perfection to win his second title at the club. But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted,\" Klopp said.\n\nKlopp had dominated this fixture since taking over at Anfield in 2015, winning nine of the past 16 derbies before Wednesday's match.\n\nStatistics showed Everton won 75% of all duels in the opening half hour, a league record for any top flight team this season.\n\nAfter just six minutes, Liverpool was grateful for VAR as it escaped an early penalty when Alisson brought down Calvert-Lewin in the box and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot. The decision was overturned because of an offside in the build up.\n\nThat pressure was made to count when Everton took the lead in in the 27th. Liverpool's defenders repeatedly failed to clear the danger from a free kick and Branthwaite's shot squirmed through the hands of Alisson and off the post before crossing the line.\n\nAgain there was an agonizing wait for a VAR check, but on this occasion there was no reprieve for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz had the chance to level before the break, but was denied by the legs of Jordan Pickford from close range.\n\nLiverpool came out with more intent for the second half without forcing Pickford into serious action before conceding a second goal.\n\nAgain the visitors failed to deal with a set piece when Dwight McNeil swung a deep corner to the far post and Calvert-Lewin rose unmarked to head home.\n\nLiverpool came close to pulling one back in the 69th, but Diaz's effort came back off the post.\n\nUNITED SCARE\n\nManchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat last-place Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry in the FA Cup semifinals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in its bid qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz in each half at Old Trafford. But Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st and and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited is up to sixth in the standings, 13 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa.\n\nPALACE SAFE\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle.\n\nPalace is on 39 points -- 14 clear of 18th-place Luton, which can only pick up a maximum of 37 if it wins its last four games of the season.\n\nIt was Palace's third-straight win to erase fears of being relegated. Defeat saw Newcastle drop to seventh.\n\nBournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 at Molineux through Antoine Semenyo's first-half strike.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Instead, this is a title challenge that has slowly ebbed away ever since Liverpool returned from the international break a month ago, the monumental efforts of a new-look team to continue challenging for a quadruple amid a relentless injury crisis ultimately catching up with them.\n\nIndeed, with only five points still required for Champions League qualification and the League Cup in the bag, this is a Reds squad that has far surpassed expectations and one that offers the new manager - and that increasingly appears to be Feyenoord head coach Arne Slot - a strong foundation on which to build.\n\nNot that it makes this dire defeat any easier to take. Having not won a home derby in approaching 14 years, the law of averages suggested Everton - buoyed by easing their long-held relegation fears - were due a victory. Liverpool can't avoid defeat every time.\n\nBut what will irk is the seeming lack of heart and aggression shown from too many players, particularly in dealing with Dominic Calvert-Lewin, and being outmuscled in midfield during the game's formative stages. This was always going to be a huge test for Liverpool's title credentials and they failed miserably, not helped, it must be said, but some questionable Klopp decisions both in terms of the starting line-up and substitutions.

We played the game Everton wanted and they scored two goals from set-pieces.\n\n\"We should have done better but we didn't. No good thoughts at all. Very disappointed and frustrated.

Juergen Klopp's men are three points behind the Gunners (77) with four games to play.\n\nHolders Manchester City remain in the driver's seat on 73 points but with two games in hand, while Everton's victory has them breathing easier, eight points above the relegation zone in 16th.\n\n\"Very disappointed in so many ways and I think everyone has to look in the mirror look at their own performances, did they give everything and do they really want to win the league?\" Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk said.\n\n\"Obviously there are still games after tonight, but if we play like we did tonight, we have no chance to win the title. It's a tough one and obviously we have to do much better against a side that is playing against relegation.\"\n\nEverton were sharper from the start and won a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Liverpool keeper Alisson only for it to be overturned by the VAR for an offside.\n\nYet it wasn't long before Branthwaite had the old stadium shaking in the 27th minute when he capitalised on poor defending from Liverpool, slotting home from close range after the Reds missed several attempts to clear the ball.\n\nAlisson could not quite get his hands on the ball which rolled off the post and in.\n\nBranthwaite is the first Everton player to score against Liverpool since Demarai Gray in a 4-1 league home loss in late- 2021.\n\n\"We spoke about the desire and the energy of the team and the physical side of the game,\" Everton manager Sean Dyche said. \"The lads did it on Sunday (2-0 win over Nottingham Forest) and they'll have to do it again. That's the challenge.\n\n\"Sunday was massive and now it was a massively important derby game.\"\n\nCalvert-Lewin leapt to head home from a corner kick to double the Toffees' lead in the 58th minute, and while Liverpool have mounted some masterful comebacks this season, Everton held strong to hand Klopp, who is leaving his role at the season's end, his first defeat at Goodison in his final derby.\n\n\"It's extra special, isn't it? Local derby -- I've been here long enough to know what it means to the fans, what it means to me,\" Calvert-Lewin told Sky Sports. \"Where we are in the league, we needed a massive three points and everything kind of came together tonight.\"\n\nLiverpool kept Everton keeper Jordan Pickford busy in the dying minutes as he leapt to bat Harvey Elliott's shot over the crossbar and then dived to save a shot from Reds talisman Mohamed Salah while Everton manager Sean Dyche looked at his watch in frustration, desperately wanting the final whistle to blow.\n\nIt was joyful bedlam when it finally did, with Everton's faithful serenading the team off the pitch.\n\n\"Great atmosphere, thoroughly deserved it, was a massive win. Hard work pays off,\" Pickford told Sky.\n\nWhile Liverpool, who had 77% possession and seven shots on target to Everton's six, won the League Cup earlier this season, the Premier League is the final trophy up for grabs for the Reds after they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Europa League.\n\nManchester United captain Bruno Fernandes came to his side's rescue with two goals in a 4-2 home victory over the Premier League's bottom club Sheffield United on Wednesday just when more trouble loomed for beleaguered manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nTwice United trailed against a side destined for a quick return to the Championship with Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz both on target for the visitors but Fernandes helped avert another damaging result.\n\nHe levelled from the penalty spot in the 61st minute after a foul on Harry Maguire, scorer of United's first equaliser.\n\nFernandes then smacked home a sizzling left-footed shot to edge his side in front before setting up Rasmus Hojlund to finally subdue their battling opponents.\n\n\"At the end we came back. We put ourselves in a position where it's tough to win games. But also it shows a bit of character,\" the Portuguese said.\n\n\"We're scoring lots of goals. It's just about that compactness we need to have as a team.\"\n\nIt was another far-from-convincing display from Ten Hag's side who have conceded 50 league goals although victory moved them above Newcastle United into sixth place to keep them in the hunt for a European qualifying spot.\n\n\"Many positives today,\" Ten Hag said. \"The resilience to fight back after losing two times. But also there were negatives. We gave it away, it can't happen, unacceptable, we have to learn from this.\"\n\nWhile Sheffield United played with plenty of heart and no little skill, time is nearly up for Chris Wilder's side who have only 16 points from 34 games and will be relegated at the weekend if they lose to Newcastle.\n\nUnited's FA Cup-semi-final win on penalties was dubbed embarrassing in some quarters after squandering a 3-0 lead against second-tier Coventry City and being spared defeat only by a controversially disallowed goal in extra time.\n\nTen Hag came out fighting this week, branding the criticism disgraceful but the Dutchman appeared to be staring into the abyss as his side again conjured trouble of their own making.\n\nThey could and should have been well ahead as chances went begging and Sheffield keeper Wes Foderingham pulled off several great saves, one from Diogo Dalot in the opening minute and another from teenager Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nBut United's habit of shooting themselves in the foot returned in the 35th minute as keeper Andre Onana aimed a pass towards Dalot but it was under hit and the alert Bogle ran through to squeeze in a shot.\n\nUnited were level before halftime as Alejandro Garnacho, one of the shining lights in a poor season, whipped in a low cross that Maguire delicately glanced in with his head.\n\nThe second half was only five minutes old when United's defence was breached all too easily again with Ben Osborn cutting back a pass for Brereton Diaz to stab high into the net.\n\nUnited looked stunned and quite what new technical director Jason Wilcox and head of football operations Dave Brailsford made of it from the directors box one can only imagine.\n\nBut United were handed a lifeline when Maguire went down in the box and Fernandes stepped up to send his kick into the corner. Fernandes then showed his class with a superb finish and United could finally breathe easy as Hojlund, who scored the winning penalty on Sunday, steered in Fernandes's pass.\n\n\"He is really leading the team. I'm very happy with his performance,\" a grateful Ten Hag said of his skipper.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You have to give it to them. You have to accept that as a Liverpool fan.\n\n\"This is the end of the title run for Liverpool. It almost feels like the end. They just have to make sure they finish the season strongly.\n\n\"They had enough chances in the game but at the moment they are not clinical enough in both boxes.\n\n\"I don't think you can get too angry with the team or Jurgen Klopp. It's been a great ride and a great journey. But tonight is Everton's night and you have to take it on the chin.\"\n\nKlopp accepted Liverpool's performance was \"not good enough\" and bemoaned the way his side played into Everton's hands, conceding both goals from set-pieces.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, Klopp - who was coaching his last Merseyside derby before standing down at the end of the season - said: \"I'm very disappointed.\n\n\"We let it happen to become the game Everton wanted. Two goals from set-pieces. They are really strong.\n\n\"But we created a lot and didn't score. Then in the second half we were emotional and in a rush, not really clear enough.\n\n\"Then we concede a second goal with a routine they do the whole season - we knew the ball was going there, we just didn't defend it well enough.\n\n\"It was free-kick after free-kick. That was part of the story. But we weren't good enough.\n\n\"I didn't expect that performance but it happened. It's not the greatest moment we're in but you have to fight through it, use your moments to get your momentum.\n\n\"We had a bit of that after Fulham but our two strikers, one is injured [Diogo Jota] and the other is a father [Cody Gakpo]. That's not helpful.\n\n\"You don't play your best football and are 2-0 down to a passionate, fighting opponent. We tried but it wasn't good enough. When you win there are 500 reasons, but when you lose it's just not good enough. That's how it is.\n\n\"I can only apologise to everyone who is with us - it's hard for us but I know for our people it is especially hard. We should've done better but we didn't and that's why we lost.\"\n\nSpeaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Neville agreed with Carragher's view on Liverpool's title chances, saying: \"It's going to be very difficult for them to win the league.\n\n\"It's not over because things can happen - Brighton could somehow beat Manchester City and Arsenal could lose in the North London Derby.\n\n\"But I think they'll go into that dressing room tonight and it'll be a sullen atmosphere. They'll know it's probably gone.\n\n\"That's where I'd be at. I can't see them winning the title from here. It would be difficult anyway but from here? No.\n\n\"In my mind, you'd almost have to be perfect if you were Liverpool and Arsenal, and I think losing tonight is a real problem for them.\"\n\nNeville also echoed Klopp's opinion that Liverpool were below par at Everton, saying it reflected a pattern in their recent performances.\n\n\"There were parts of their first half at Fulham that I didn't like on Saturday,\" said Neville. \"I don't like Liverpool but I like Liverpool's style, when they play quickly and there's a real fizz in their passing.\n\n\"They just played a little slowly from the back - a little more predictable.\n\n\"I know they've changed over the years under Jurgen Klopp. That first period was fast and furious, and at times a bit erratic, but I'd rather them go back to that.\n\n\"Tonight they were sloppy, they gave the ball away and free-kicks away. They missed big chances.\"\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk urged his team-mates to question their desire to win the Premier League, telling Sky Sports: \"Very disappointed in so many ways.\n\n\"I think everyone has to look in the mirror, look at their own performance and if they really gave everything. Do they really want to win the league?\n\n\"We are fighting, there are games after tonight, but play like we did overall in the game like today - not winning challenges and giving the ref an opportunity to give a free kick, like he did many times - then you have no chance to win a title.\n\n\"It's a tough one and we need to do much better against a side that's fighting relegation. We had clear-cut chances in the first half that we should have scored but we weren't good enough and it starts with the fight.\n\n\"We can't let the season go out like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North London derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/04/1600x900/skysports-jurgen-klopp-luis-diaz_6532431.jpg?20240424234024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Everton meanwhile sits 16th and is not yet assured of its Premier League status for next season.\n\nKlopp has lost just one of his 18 derbies as Liverpool manager -- a 2-0 defeat at Anfield in 2021, with the match played behind closed doors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has won just two of seven visits to Goodison Park.\n\nREAD MORE: Four things 'definitely' happen if Liverpool hires Arne Slot including transfers and formation\n\nREAD MORE: Six players could benefit if Arne Slot replaces J\u00fcrgen Klopp amid Liverpool next manager latest\n\nThe German has relished the rivalry, having faced off against eight Everton managers during his time on Merseyside. But Klopp says he will not necessarily miss derby day, such is the pressure on his team.\n\nHe said ahead of the match: \"The pressure is higher so why should the joy be higher? You win it, great, but why should I miss the pressure around it?\n\n\"This time, when you're really playing for something, that's the pressure. But when you are both not in a great moment, it's the one game you have to win, definitely. That kind of pressure - why would I miss that? It's not enjoyable.\n\n\"Everyone else can only watch it and think 'oh my God, it looks exciting'. But somebody has to make the decisions, somebody has to do this, somebody has to do that.\n\n\"So many people visit me always around the games and say 'we will not see that anymore or that anymore' and I just want to tell you - I work all the time while you just come here and watch the games.\n\n\"I'm constantly in it, even when the game is over I can't switch off. It's not great to be in this situation all the time. Maybe other people enjoy that more than me. But that's something I definitely will not miss.\"\n\nKlopp admits he won't even be able to enjoy the match as a neutral when he leaves Liverpool this summer. He adds: \"I will never be able to watch a Merseyside derby without any kind of (emotion).\n\n\"I feel exactly the same as everybody else around these games, but as long as I'm involved, I have to be calm. But if I am just watching it, then I will feel a different kind of emotion, definitely. I want Liverpool to win all of them, definitely. That means it's important.

Man United survives another scare - The Daily Reporter - Greenfield Indiana", "body": "LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- Jurgen Klopp's hopes of a dream send-off were left in tatters after a 2-0 loss at Everton dealt a major blow to Liverpool's Premier League title bid on Wednesday.\n\nGoals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin at Goodison Park meant Klopp tasted a bitter defeat in his last Merseyside derby before standing down at the end of the season.\n\n\"I can only apologize for today to the people. We should have done better and we didn't and that's why we lost,\" Klopp said.\n\nThe loss keeps Liverpool three points behind league leader Arsenal in second place and one ahead of defending champion Manchester City, which is in third and has two games in hand on both of its rivals.\n\nKlopp had spoken last week of needing perfection to win his second title at the club. But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted,\" Klopp said.\n\nKlopp had dominated this fixture since taking over at Anfield in 2015, winning nine of the past 16 derbies before Wednesday's match.\n\nStatistics showed Everton won 75% of all duels in the opening half hour, a league record for any top flight team this season.\n\nAfter just six minutes, Liverpool was grateful for VAR as it escaped an early penalty when Alisson brought down Calvert-Lewin in the box and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot. The decision was overturned because of an offside in the build up.\n\nThat pressure was made to count when Everton took the lead in in the 27th. Liverpool's defenders repeatedly failed to clear the danger from a free kick and Branthwaite's shot squirmed through the hands of Alisson and off the post before crossing the line.\n\nAgain there was an agonizing wait for a VAR check, but on this occasion there was no reprieve for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz had the chance to level before the break, but was denied by the legs of Jordan Pickford from close range.\n\nLiverpool came out with more intent for the second half without forcing Pickford into serious action before conceding a second goal.\n\nAgain the visitors failed to deal with a set piece when Dwight McNeil swung a deep corner to the far post and Calvert-Lewin rose unmarked to head home.\n\nLiverpool came close to pulling one back in the 69th, but Diaz's effort came back off the post.\n\nUNITED SCARE\n\nManchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat last-place Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry in the FA Cup semifinals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in its bid qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz in each half at Old Trafford. But Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st and and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited is up to sixth in the standings, 13 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa.\n\nPALACE SAFE\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle.\n\nPalace is on 39 points -- 14 clear of 18th-place Luton, which can only pick up a maximum of 37 if it wins its last four games of the season.\n\nIt was Palace's third-straight win to erase fears of being relegated. Defeat saw Newcastle drop to seventh.\n\nBournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 at Molineux through Antoine Semenyo's first-half strike.", "source": {"uri": "greenfieldreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now we need a crisis at City and Arsenal.\n\n'And we need to win football games. Because if they start losing all the games and we do what we did tonight, nothing changes.\n\n'And we are not safe in the Champions League [places] either, so we should just play better football. That would be really good.'\n\nLiverpool are currently 14 points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, who have two games in hand, and it would take an astonishing series of results for the north Londoners to overtake them.\n\nKlopp was also asked in his TV interview if Liverpool can still challenge for the title, telling Sky Sports: 'That must happen a lot. They must come in a very bad moment, Arsenal and Man City, and actually yesterday it didn't look like that.\n\n'I don't know [if we're still in the race]. I can only apologise to the people. Everybody who is with us knows how hard this is for us as well, but I know for other people it's especially hard. So we should have done better but we didn't and that's why we lost.'\n\nSpeaking to Match of the Day, he added: 'Arsenal didn't look very weak last night. We have to play better, that is it. We need points. We are not safe in the Champions League. Tottenham have played a lot of games less than us.'\n\nMORE : 'What is he doing?!' - Jamie Carragher slams Liverpool duo after shock Everton defeat\n\nMORE : Mauricio Pochettino's Chelsea future 'in the balance' with three replacements being considered", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_roberts@metro.co.uk", "name": "Ewan Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Pochettino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mauricio Pochettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2150020363.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C20px%2C1024px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

look certain to extend their 70-year stay in the English top flight despite being deducted eight points on two charges of breaching financial rules.\n\nKlopp had never lost on his previous eight visits to Goodison but his final taste of the Merseyside derby was a bitter one.\n\nHopes of a glorious goodbye for the German after a nearly nine-year reign that has transformed the club's fortunes are fading fast.\n\nAccording to reports, Feyenoord boss Arne Slot is being lined up as Klopp's successor and the past few weeks have exposed weaknesses that need addressing in a huge summer for the Liverpool hierarchy.\n\nThe Reds have won just one of their last four league games and have also bowed out of the FA Cup and Europa League in recent weeks.\n\nKlopp made six changes after resting a number of key players for Sunday's 3-1 win at Fulham but did not get the response he desired.\n\nSlow starts have been a recurring factor as Liverpool's quest for four trophies has unravelled.\n\nBuoyed by their weekend win over Nottingham Forest to pull clear of the relegation zone, Everton are a side transformed from the one that went 13 Premier League games without a win between December and April.\n\nThe home side thought they had a penalty when Calvert-Lewin was tripped by Alisson Becker but VAR intervened to save the visitors as the Everton striker was offside.\n\nAlisson then clawed away a Calvert-Lewin header and Ben Godfrey nodded wide as Liverpool struggled to cope with Everton's threat from set-pieces.\n\nMore comical defending from the Reds led to the opener on 27 minutes.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister's mishit fell perfectly for Branthwaite and the defender's effort went in off the post despite Alisson's best efforts.\n\nGoing behind woke Liverpool from their slumber and only a combination of wasteful finishing and Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's lead until half-time.\n\nDarwin Nunez blasted straight at the England number one when clean through before the Uruguayan teed up Luis Diaz to fire too close to Pickford.\n\nMohamed Salah's loss of form has come at the worst possible time for Liverpool's title challenge and the Egyptian sliced another good opening well over the bar.\n\nLiverpool were camped in the Everton half after the break, yet the hosts pulled further clear just before the hour mark from another dead ball.\n\nCalvert-Lewin was afforded a free header at the back post to power home Dwight McNeil's corner.\n\nLiverpool's night was summed up when Diaz's powerful effort came back off the post with Pickford finally beaten.\n\nBut it was Klopp who was crestfallen come the final whistle as he looks set to depart Anfield with just one Premier League title to his name.", "source": {"uri":

For the first time in 14 long years, Everton emerged victorious against their local rivals at Goodison Park. Victory will taste all the sweeter for Sean Dyche's team with their top-flight status almost certainly secured at the expense of Liverpool's title chances.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" sang the home crowd as they rejoiced in a deserved Everton victory, an outstanding Everton performance and the best night of Dyche's reign. Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals that consigned Liverpool to a hugely damaging defeat.\n\nEverton were fired up and Goodison responded in kind. The old ground pulsated as Dyche's team performed with an intent, intensity and quality that has been absent too often this season. Calvert-Lewin, an injury doubt on the eve of the game, led the line superbly. It was no coincidence that the supply to the centre-forward was vastly improved too. Jack Harrison and Dwight McNeil delivered the service that Calvert-Lewin craves while working tirelessly to help Idrissa Gueye and James Garner assert control in midfield. Liverpool were rattled and vulnerable long before Branthwaite gave Everton a richly deserved lead.\n\nLiverpool were missing both Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo, the latter joining the injured striker on the sidelines after his partner went into labour hours before kick-off. They were also missing composure for long periods of the first half, although it may be more accurate to say Everton refused to allow them to have it.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 spurned the first good chance of the derby when turning Dwight McNeil's low cross wide from close range. Branthwaite instigated the move with a pinpoint diagonal ball that turned the Liverpool defence and sent Harrison scampering away from Andy Robertson.\n\nHarrison was also involved in an incident that threatened serious repercussions for the visitors' night. The winger put Calvert-Lewin through on goal with a delightful cross with the outside of his foot. The striker nudged the ball around Alisson and was sent sprawling by the Liverpool goalkeeper before he could convert into an unguarded net. The referee Andy Madley immediately pointed to the penalty spot and showed Alisson a yellow card, to the fury of the home crowd. Their mood deteriorated further when VAR found that Calvert-Lewin was offside when receiving Harrison's delivery. No penalty and no yellow card.\n\nThe reprieve did not shake Liverpool out of their pedestrian approach. Ben Godfrey launched himself into a vital challenge to prevent Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez or Curtis Jones converting a first-time cross from Mohamed Salah, but Everton remained in the ascendancy until the final 15 minutes of the first half. Godfrey headed wide when well placed at a McNeil free-kick. Another McNeil free-kick found its way to Calvert-Lewin via James Tarkowski but Alisson saved the striker's close range header.\n\nIt was third time lucky for McNeil free-kicks when another needless Liverpool foul, this time Jones on Gueye, presented the winger with one more opportunity to worry the visiting defence. The initial delivery was cleared as far as Tarkowski, who hooked the ball back across the penalty area to Harrison. His first-time touch teed up Godfrey and, though his shot was blocked, the rebound fell invitingly for Branthwaite lurking unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box. The defender's low shot squirmed under Alisson, rolled against the inside of a post and trickled in. There was another VAR check for offside against the goalscorer but, after a lengthy delay, Everton were not denied for a second time.\n\nNow Liverpool responded. Klopp's side finally began to control possession and stretch the Everton defence. Jordan Pickford, previously untroubled, saved from N\u00fa\u00f1ez when the Uruguay international was played through by Salah. The Everton keeper also denied Luis D\u00edaz with his legs after N\u00fa\u00f1ez turned provider. N\u00fa\u00f1ez created a clear opening for Salah too but, having scuffed his initial shot against Branthwaite, Liverpool's leading goalscorer skied the rebound wastefully.\n\nEverton also mounted fierce resistance in the face of Liverpool's belated pressure. Branthwaite and Gueye threw themselves in the way of goalbound shots. Tarkowski dominated his penalty area to repel numerous crosses.\n\nThe pattern continued after the restart but, from their first attack of note, Everton unearthed the luxury of a second goal. McNeil stung Alisson's fingertips with a powerful drive from 25 yards. From the resulting corner, taken deep by McNeil, Calvert-Lewin soared into a gap left by Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk to head into the bottom corner.\n\nMcNeil was close to making it three when Harrison dispossessed Wataru Endo, a Liverpool substitute, on the edge of the area. His well-placed shot was deflected wide. Liverpool, in desperate need of a way through, peppered the Everton area with crosses but struck a royal blue shirt all too frequently or were instantly closed down when they did have sight of goal. D\u00edaz did eventually beat Pickford with a shot that curled in from the left but it smacked the inside of the far post and bounced away. \u00adPickford also denied Harvey Elliott and Salah late on as Everton held on to a famous win.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_hunter@theguardian.com", "name": "Andy Hunter",

Philippe Coutinho put Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool ahead early on, but Kevin Mirallas quickly equalised for Roberto Martinez's Everton.\n\nLuis Suarez restored Liverpool's advantage before two goals from Romelu Lukaku gave Everton a late lead. However, they could not hold on as Sturridge scored in the last minute to ensure a point apiece in a six-goal thriller.\n\nLiverpool raced into a two-goal lead at Goodison Park thanks to a Leighton Baines own goal and one for Luis Suarez. He celebrated with a dive in front of Toffees boss David Moyes, who before the game had said the Uruguayan fell to ground too easily.\n\nEverton fought back with goals from Leon Osman and Steven Naismith and it ended 2-2, despite Suarez, controversially and incorrectly, having what would have been a late winner ruled out for offside.\n\nThis was the first match since John W Henry and Tom Werner bought Liverpool, but it was the Toffees fans left celebrating.\n\nTim Cahill and Mikel Arteta scored the goals that left the Reds in the rare position of being in the relegation zone with only six points from eight games and only goal difference keeping them off the bottom of the table.\n\nWhat a day for Everton fans.\n\nThe Toffees secured their biggest win over their city rivals in more than 40 years thanks to a goal from Tim Cahill and two from Andrew Johnson.\n\nA five-goal thriller at Goodison Park with late drama.\n\nEmile Heskey gave Liverpool an early lead before Duncan Ferguson equalised. Markus Babbel restored the Reds advantage, Robbie Fowler missed a penalty that would have made it 3-1 before Igor Biscan was sent off for the visitors.\n\nDavid Unsworth converted an 83rd-minute spot-kick to make it 2-2, but Liverpool won it in the last minute with Gary McAllister's superb free-kick.\n\nAnd one for the older fans...\n\nWe know this did not take place in the 21st Century but it was just too good to be left out.\n\nEverton came from behind four times in this pulsating 4-4 draw after extra time with Liverpool in the 1991 FA Cup fifth round, in what was to be Kenny Dalglish's final match as manager in his first term with the Reds.\n\nThis was the last season of multiple replays in the FA Cup, with Everton winning the second replay 1-0.", "source": {"uri":

And make no mistake: This was not just a famous win. It was one that was deserved.\n\nEFC RATINGS: Three score perfect 10 in famous Liverpool victory\n\nREAD MORE: Everton 2-0 Liverpool reaction and analysis\n\nAfter so many years, so many disappointments in this fixture, and so much heartbreak and heartache, it was an emotional one too. This is a club and a fanbase that has suffered their lowest as their biggest foes have ridden the crest of a silverware-laden wave. All those taunts, all those jibes, all that devastation - all now a thing of the past. On April 24 - and that date is significant - the underdogs bit back, roared on by a crowd that has deserved far more nights like this in recent years. \"You lost the league at Goodison Park\" was the cry that rang out as this game entered stoppage time. This was not just a win, it was an exorcism. It was the night a tormented fanbase banished some of its most spiteful ghosts.\n\nThis was the first time Goodison had hosted a match on this date since 1985, that incredible night when Bayern Munich were put to the sword in L4. The spirits of better days may have woken from the corners and rafters of Goodison to inspire this win but it was a victory sealed by the stars of the present - because there are some in this Everton team. One for the future, Jarrad Branthwaite created hope when he opened the scoring in the first half. Jordan Pickford, the player who has done more than anyone else to help this club survive some of its darkest days, once again supplied a performance that will have his many critics frothing in indignation at his greatness.\n\nAnd then there was Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Hope turned to belief when he leapt highest at the back post in the second half to create a memory that will last a lifetime. When he wheeled away in delight he ran, followed by his team-mates, to the same corner Conor Coady had charged to when he thought he had ended Everton's winless home derby run in this fixture last year. VAR then intervened. Of course it did. That memory, that frustration and disappointment, like so many other such moments in this fixture, was released for good on Wednesday night.\n\nThat was because, and this is the simple reality, a truth that should be savoured, Liverpool could not cope. This was Sean Dyche football at its very best. Everton launched out of the traps and left Liverpool shellshocked. The illustrious names that run through the opposition line-up were reduced to clumsy, late fouls as they tried - and failed - to halt the growing momentum and belief from a home side that fed off the reaction their efforts sparked in the stands around them. Calvert-Lewin harried Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk, Ben Godfrey snapped at the heels of Luis Diaz and Jack Harrison produced devilish crosses. It was from one of the wide man's clever balls that Everton thought they had stolen the advantage. Harrison's chip bounced into no man's land between Alisson and his defence. Calvert-Lewin exploited the uncertainty and poked the ball around the Liverpool goalkeeper, who then brought him down. What looked set to be just Everton's third penalty of the season of course proved too good to be true. Not for the first time, VAR provided a sucker-punch to this team.\n\nAny concern that would prove a turning point was misplaced. Everton kept coming and Liverpool kept conceding free-kick after free-kick. If the fouls were tactical, the plan was wrong. Everton caused issues from almost every set-piece and both Godfrey and James Tarkowski came close with the score goalless. When Curtis Jones gave away Liverpool's eighth foul his side was eventually punished. Dwight McNeil's cross caused carnage in front of the Park End and Branthwaite's back-post header was only half-dealt with. When the ball was sent back into the box, Godfrey's skewed effort ricocheted around the area and fell to Branthwaite, who squeezed his effort in to send Goodison wild. VAR tried, but failed, to ruin this moment and the hosts had a lead they deserved.\n\nThe Blues continued to snap and snarl but, to the frustration of Dyche, started to drop back once they had a lead to protect. The intensity remained but the pressure on the defence increased and Liverpool, while unconvincing, created opportunities. Pickford, a hero of so many key games for this club, had to be on top form once again and he saved from Darwin Nunez, Diaz and Andy Robertson to protect his side's advantage going into a break that Everton needed. With the game in the balance against Nottingham Forest on Sunday he saved from Chris Wood to inspire another clean sheet in another must-win game that was ultimately won by this team. These saves, and his late stop from Mohamed Salah, were not as good as that point-blank block, but this was another volley of shots fired in the direction of his doubters who, somehow, remain. This was also his sixth clean sheet against Liverpool in his career. Apparently he is a liability.\n\nIn the second half a home crowd heady with nerves and hope feared an onslaught in Jurgen Klopp's final derby. Liverpool tried but were not good enough. As those in Red pushed forward, they left gaps that were exploited by the players with more energy, more desire. Abdoulaye Doucoure rode challenges from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mac Allister to set up Idrissa Gueye. The Senegal international was unable to repeat his goalscoring heroics of the weekend but he deserved his standing ovation when he was brought off.\n\nBefore that substitution, Everton pounced again with McNeil forcing Alisson to tip over after another counter attack. From the corner that followed Calvert-Lewin scored his most important goal, and Goodison's most-celebrated goal, since his header on that memorable night when Everton came back to secure survival against Crystal Palace.\n\nThis beautiful stadium has deserved better than relegation fights in its final years. But it is at its fiercest best when this side has its back against the wall. This was a spiteful, aggressive, ruthless performance when this club really needed it. The reward, as supporters used to torment realised this would not be another night of pain, was a final 15 minutes that will be remembered long after this stadium is no more. The sound of Liverpool was Spirit of the Blues. The place to be was under the lights at Goodison Park. And the pay-off, a win that moves Everton eight points clear of the bottom three, is a fanbase that should be able to sleep soundly in May. There are no prizes for guessing what the subject of those dreams will be.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In their previous meeting earlier this season, the Reds ran circles around the Blues at Anfield Stadium, securing a comfortable 2-0 victory. At Goodison, Everton returned the favor, clinching a 2-0 win against the Premier League aspirants. It marked their first victory over Liverpool at Goodison Park since October 17, 2010. That game also ended 2-0, with now Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, scoring Everton's insurance goal.\n\nToiling near the relegation zone, Everton needed a stellar performance to get something out of their game against their more accomplished rivals. Sean Dyche understood the assignment perfectly and set up his team to the best of his ability. Dominic Calvert-Lewin got the license to hound the Reds' defenders while the likes of Jarrad Branthwaite and James Tarkowski took the fight to them in set-pieces.\n\nCalvert-Lewin had the first stab at the Liverpool backline in the sixth minute as he won a penalty after tumbling inside the Reds' box under pressure from Alisson. The referee pointed the spot right away but the VAR overturned his decision a couple of minutes later. Calvert-Lewin was adjudged to be in an offside position when he received the ball from Jack Harrison and barged into the box. The visitors created a couple of decent chances of their own in the following 10 minutes, but their finishing was not up to the mark.\n\nHaving been under the cosh, Everton put their noses in front in the 27th minute, thanks to Branthwaite's sharp reflexes. Alisson did well to parry the center-back's header from a free-kick. However, he could not hoof it out of danger. The ball found its way to Ben Godfrey, who attempted to poke it home. The ball once again encountered a few roadblocks and landed at Branthwaite's feet, who had another go from close range. His shot slid underneath Alisson and went over the goalline before Calvert-Lewin smashed it in. Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz, and Andy Robertson all tested the keeper before the referee blew the whistle for the end of the first half, but Jordan Pickford refused to surrender.\n\nJust under the hour mark, Everton doubled their advantage, thanks to an unstoppable header from Calvert-Lewin. Dwight McNeil delivered an impeccable corner at the far post and the striker made use of his neck muscles to send the ball sizzling past the goalkeeper.\n\nDiaz hit the post in the 69th minute while Harvey Elliott and Salah saw two excellent shots saved by Pickford at the death, capping off a disappointing night for the away fans.\n\nWhen Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp announced his decision to step down at the end of the season, his team were alive and well in all major cup competitions. They were the favorites to progress to the UEFA Europa League semi-final at Atalanta's expense, were expected to blow Manchester United away in the FA Cup quarter-finals, and were in with a real opportunity to win the Premier League.\n\nOver the last month and a half, everything took a turn for the worse. In mid-March, Manchester United beat them 4-3 in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Last week, they crashed out of the UEFA Europa League after suffering a 3-1 aggregate defeat to Atalanta. Now, they have slipped to second place in the Premier League rankings, having played two games more than third-placed Manchester City who are only a point behind. Even if the Cityzens slip, Liverpool would not have the advantage in the title race, as provision leaders Arsenal -- sitting 3 points ahead -- would pounce.\n\nThanks to the Carabao Cup win in February, Klopp will not end the season without a trophy. But it is unlikely to be the dream send-off every Liverpool fan was praying for.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Paul ELLIS / AFP/File\n\nJurgen Klopp's nearly nine years at Liverpool have been filled with memorable milestones but an unwanted first of his reign leaves his final few weeks at Anfield with little left to play for.\n\nKlopp tasted defeat in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park for the first time in nine visits as a 2-0 defeat against Everton left the Reds' dreams of sending their manager off as a Premier League winner in tatters.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Liverpool were on course for a potential quadruple but have come off the rails, said AFP.\n\nA run of four wins in nine games has seen Klopp's men crash out of the Europa League and FA Cup as well as falling off the pace at the top of the Premier League.\n\nLiverpool trail leaders Arsenal by three points and are only one point ahead of defending champions Manchester City, who have two games in hand.\n\nAFP Sport looks at what has gone wrong to leave Klopp's fitting farewell at risk of fizzling out.\n\nSlow starts\n\nLiverpool's habit of fighting back from losing positions was lauded earlier in the campaign as a sign of the \"mentality monsters\" Klopp has created throughout his time at Anfield.\n\nThey have amassed 27 points after falling behind in the Premier League alone this season, but have seen their luck run out after falling behind to Crystal Palace and Everton in shock defeats over the past 10 days.\n\nIn all competitions, Liverpool have conceded the opening goal 22 times this season.\n\nThey never recovered from a sluggish start at Goodison as Everton wasted a number of chances and had a penalty overturned by VAR even before Jarrad Branthwaite opened the scoring on 27 minutes.\n\nWasteful finishing\n\nLiverpool's forward line has also gone off the boil come the business end of the season.\n\nThey have failed to score from open play in four of their last five games.\n\nMohamed Salah has looked out of sorts since returning from a hamstring injury picked up at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nLuis Diaz and Darwin Nunez were again guilty of wasting huge chances against Everton.\n\nAnd Diogo Jota, often heralded as the most natural finisher at the club, has been sidelined again by injury after just returning from a two-month layoff.\n\n\"You can see we are in a rush in front of goal,\" said Klopp. \"We create a lot but we don't score often enough.\n\n\"You can see that and that's the problem. You have to fight through these periods. It's not a problem of attitude, the boys want it but it is my job to bring them into a situation where they feel confident to do it.\"\n\nFatigue\n\nThe quest for the quadruple could now be coming back to haunt Klopp as Liverpool look to have run out of steam.\n\nThey have played 54 games this season and will have four more before the end of the campaign.\n\nA number of academy graduates stepped up during an injury crisis in the early months of 2024 and helped ensure Klopp did at least secure some silverware in his final season by winning the League Cup in February.\n\nYet, just as they are getting major players back with Alisson Becker and Trent Alexander-Arnold returning in recent weeks, those that have been relied on most during the winter months are fading.\n\nKlopp admitted after the Palace match that midfield duo Alexis Mac Allister and Wataru Endo are struggling due to the burden placed upon them earlier in the campaign.\n\n\"Players who played all the games are less fresh but it is the same for the other teams. I don't want that to be an excuse,\" added Klopp.\n\n\"A lot of things come together so it is not great timing. I would prefer to be sitting here winning 4-0 and flying but the job is to win football games and the more you win, the more successful you are.\n\n\"In the moment we didn't win enough to get anything from the season.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Cup_of_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa Cup of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2024-04/623856_0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Liverpool started a first-choice team for the high-stakes match and maintained the edge in possession throughout but went down after just 27 minutes when Jarrad Branthwaite scored. Everton maintained a similar attacking prowess to the Reds throughout the game and eventually scored a second in the 55th minute through Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nThe loss means Liverpool are now three points behind league-leaders Arsenal, who beat Chelsea 5-0 on Tuesday.

Both Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez are out of sorts and are irking fans with subpar performances. Everton's triumph is crucial in their fight to avoid relegation, and they managed to win despite their wastefulness in front of goal.\n\nLiverpool received a hammer blow in their pursuit of Premier League gold in a disheartening 2-0 loss against Merseyside rivals Everton who, in turn, gave themselves a timely boost in their bid to stay afloat.\n\nManchester United-linked Jarrad Branthwaite opened the scoring. The young Englishman's frantic shot goalward crept under Alisson and in off the post as Goodison Park was sent into elation.\n\nWasteful in their chances, Jurgen Klopp's side would come to rue their toothlessness as Dominic Calvert-Lewin produced a salmon-like leap to power home Dwight McNeil's corner to compound more misery on the aforementioned German's farewell tour.\n\nIn the wake of the surprise, what are fans pondering over? Here are five of the many talking points that supporters are talking about after Everton one-upped their local rivals for the first time since February 2021.\n\nNunez's Substandard Finishing 'I'm done with Nunez'\n\nDarwin Nunez is a divisive figure among the Anfield faithful - but it seems as if some Liverpool supporters are losing their patience with their Uruguayan striker. As much of a nuisance as he is to opposition defenders, his footballing intelligence is not up to scratch for a club the size of the Reds.\n\nOne Liverpool fan on X (formerly Twitter) suggested that he is 'done' former Benfica man Darwin Nunez, thanks to his lack of output, citing his inability to stay onside or turn up in 'meaningful matches'. Since arriving from Benfica, he has been an unreliable figure in terms of his finishing and his substandard performance against the Toffees could seemingly be the final nail in the coffin for some Liverpool fans.\n\nRelated 10 Worst Finishers in the Premier League in 2023/24 Season Erling Haaland and Nicolas Jackson are both among the 10 worst finishers in the Premier League this season, according to stats. Liverpool's Title Hopes All but Over Arsenal and City in stronger positions\n\nThe thought of securing their second Premier League title in their history was a brilliant one for the Reds pre-Everton, given they could do so in Klopp's final season as boss. But, now, with Arsenal and Manchester City showing no signs of slowing down, their 2-0 hiccup could be costly.\n\nThey now reside three points behind the table-topping Gunners and just one point ahead of Pep Guardiola's side. The problem? The latter have two games in hand, which has left a seed of doubt in the minds of fans in terms of Liverpool's chances.\n\nPoor Defensive Record Scuppers Liverpool's Title Charge Reds have gone behind 22 times in 34 games\n\nLiverpool are doubtlessly brilliant going forward. The likes of Salah, Nunez, Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota all have the capability of being elite forwards - but it's from a defensive standpoint that the biggest change is needed in the post-Klopp era.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Liverpool have gone 1-0 down in 15 different Premier League games this season. Only in 2022/23 (16) have they conceded first in more games in a single league campaign under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nOne fan has suggested their leaky defence, which results in them going behind in games so often has dampened their aspirations of winning a league title this term. Reddit user OnePieceAce said:\n\n\"You can't and don't win a league title going behind 22 times in 34 games.\"\n\nMohamed Salah's Struggles Continue Two goals in his last seven Premier League matches\n\nMohamed Salah is a Liverpool icon, there is no doubt about that. But given their current circumstances, it's odd to see him not take the team by the scruff of the neck. The Egyptian was relatively anonymous against Everton - and some fans are questioning why he is shooting as if he's never kicked a ball in his life.\n\nSince the turn of the year, Salah has been completely out of sorts. There is currently a dark cloud looming over the winger's future at the club, and he is certainly not doing himself any favours with the summer looming, too. Everton aside, he has just two goals in his last seven Premier League outings.\n\nRelated 6 Reasons it Could be Time for Mohamed Salah to Leave Liverpool Mohamed Salah may actually be better off departing Liverpool at the end of the 2023/24 season due to several factors. Everton Get Job Done Despite Wasteful Finishing Now eight points clear of relegation spots\n\nFor all of Liverpool's deficiencies, 16th-placed Everton deserve credit for overseeing what could be such a crucial win in their fight to stay up. It may have been frantic for Sean Dyche's side - largely thanks to their own wasteful nature in front of goal - but it could have been made much simpler if they had finished more of their 16 chances.\n\nAnd the fan writing on Reddit is certainly right. Liverpool were not at the races from the first minute to the end of time, and it was for Everton's taking all throughout. Sure, they got the job done, but it was much more difficult than what it needed to be with the relegation dogfight as fierce as ever. The boys in blue are now eight points clear.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

You have to fight through these periods. It's not a problem of attitude, the boys want it but it is my job to bring them into a situation where they feel confident to do it.\"\n\nFatigue\n\nThe quest for the quadruple could now be coming back to haunt Klopp as Liverpool look to have run out of steam.\n\nThey have played 54 games this season and will have four more before the end of the campaign.\n\nA number of academy graduates stepped up during an injury crisis in the early months of 2024 and helped ensure Klopp did at least secure some silverware in his final season by winning the League Cup in February.\n\nYet, just as they are getting major players back with Alisson Becker and Trent Alexander-Arnold returning in recent weeks, those that have been relied on most during the winter months are fading.\n\nKlopp admitted after the Palace match that midfield duo Alexis Mac Allister and Wataru Endo are struggling due to the burden placed upon them earlier in the campaign.\n\n\"Players who played all the games are less fresh but it is the same for the other teams. I don't want that to be an excuse,\" added Klopp.\n\n\"A lot of things come together so it is not great timing. I would prefer to be sitting here winning 4-0 and flying but the job is to win football games and the more you win, the more successful you are.\n\n\"In the moment we didn't win enough to get anything from the season.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/7142aa88-f506-11ee-b9e5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/622357c147fd7588699ee6a9cf8b23cdfc87bee7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\nKlopp had dominated this fixture since taking over at Anfield in 2015, winning nine of the past 16 derbies before Wednesday's match.\n\nStatistics showed Everton won 75 percent of all duels in the opening half hour, a league record for any top flight team this season.\n\nAfter just six minutes, Liverpool was grateful for VAR as it escaped an early penalty when Alisson brought down Calvert-Lewin in the box and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot. The decision was overturned because of an offside in the build up.\n\nThat pressure was made to count when Everton took the lead in in the 27th. Liverpool's defenders repeatedly failed to clear the danger from a free kick and Branthwaite's shot squirmed through the hands of Alisson and off the post before crossing the line.\n\nAgain there was an agonizing wait for a VAR check, but on this occasion there was no reprieve for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz had the chance to level before the break, but was denied by the legs of Jordan Pickford from close range.\n\nLiverpool came out with more intent for the second half without forcing Pickford into serious action before conceding a second goal.\n\nAgain the visitors failed to deal with a set piece when Dwight McNeil swung a deep corner to the far post and Calvert-Lewin rose unmarked to head home.\n\nLiverpool came close to pulling one back in the 69th, but Diaz's effort came back off the post.\n\nUnited scare\n\nManchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat last-place Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry in the FA Cup semifinals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in its bid qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton in each half at Old Trafford. But Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st and and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited is up to sixth in the standings, 13 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa.\n\nPalace safe\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle.\n\nPalace is on 39 points -- 14 clear of 18th-place Luton, which can only pick up a maximum of 37 if it wins its last four games of the season.\n\nIt was Palace's third-straight win to erase fears of being relegated. Defeat saw Newcastle drop to seventh.\n\nBournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 at Molineux through Antoine Semenyo's first-half strike.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab

After dropping points at Man United and losing at home to Crystal Palace, Klopp should really find himself five points ahead of their title rivals but instead are level with the Gunners as of last weekend and a point ahead of City.\n\nFor Everton, things just seem to go from bad to worse with two points deductions costing them eight points so far this season. It would put Sean Dyche's side comfortably out of the relegation fight but instead find themselves five points above the relegation zone with Nottingham Forest, Luton Town and Burnley all separated by just three points between them.

It is very disappointing. We played the game Everton wanted and they scored two goals from set pieces. We should have done better but we didn\u2019t,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cNo good thoughts at all. Very disappointed and frustrated. It was not good enough.\n\n\u201cIt was not the most inspired performance of all time, I really feel for the people. We never lost here [it was Everton\u2019s first Goodison derby win in almost 14 years] and it feels really different. I really apologise for that.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say now that we are still fully in it; we need a crisis at Man City and Arsenal and need to win football games because if they start losing all their games and we do what we did tonight nothing changes.\n\n\u201cWe are not safe in the Champions League as well so we should just play better football.\n\n\u201cIt is not a problem of attitude or what the boys want. No one is doing that on purpose.\n\n\u201cIt is my job to bring them into a situation where they feel confident to do that. That part I am responsible and I am responsible for what happened tonight.\n\n\u201cIt is not that I feel great, that is the most tricky part of football obviously. In the moment it didn\u2019t work out and we have to keep trying.\u201d\n\nVictory for Everton lifted them eight clear of 18th-placed Luton, whom they still have to play, and almost certainly secured them top-flight survival.\n\n\u201cPleased obviously, delighted with the performance against a top side, delighted for the Evertonians and the old-school Toffees,\u201d said manager Sean Dyche.\n\n\u201cThey were terrific. Terrific on Sunday. I am pleased for the club, only the second win in 30 [derbies] I am told.\n\n\u201cI think the game was won in the tactical delivery of the team. The performance and level of the performance was top notch. I want to play beautiful football but I want to play winning football first.\n\n\u201cThis is not as satisfying as the final game of last season [when they escaped relegation with a win over Bournemouth] but it is satisfying to give something back. It is a different kind of satisfaction, believe me.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Liverpool were at full strength but they couldn't handle Everton's direct approach, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin a raging bully up top.\n\nThe Everton centre-forward only just stopped short of flushing Ibrahima Konate's head down the toilet and stealing Virgi Van Dijk's pocket money.\n\nCalvert-Lewin netted a sky-scraping header for the second goal, having been denied an early penalty before Jarrad Branthwaite's first-half opener.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nEverton are surely safe now, despite their points deductions. This was a third straight home for Dyche and it was richly deserved.\n\nLiverpool missed a shedload of chances, which has been the story of their season.\n\nAnd particularly since Klopp announced his intention to leave, back in January.\n\nThe Reds were virtually invincible until that moment but have been beaten five times since.\n\nRemarkably, they were a more effective side when they were injury-ravaged and stuffed full with kids.\n\nKlopp's only previous derby defeat had come at an empty Anfield during the pandemic season of 2020-21.\n\nDyche is the eighth Everton boss Klopp has faced in this fixture and only the second to have beaten the German, after Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nAnd how the blue half of Scouseville loved it. They have been heartily sick of all the cloying 'This Means More' sentimentality around Klopp's impending departure.\n\nKlopp has won fewer English titles than either Howard Kendall or Harry Catterick, as Evertonians have kept reminding their rivals, and that is surely how it is going to remain.\n\nThe Anfield chief made five changes after a mix-and-match team had kept them in the title hunt with an impressive win at Fulham on Sunday.\n\nBut there were two serious scares for Liverpool inside the opening six minutes.\n\nFirst, Abdoulaye Doucoure stabbed horribly wide after a flowing Everton move, then after all the shenanigans of Sunday's win over Nottingham Forest, came another penalty that never was.\n\nJames Tarkowski won a crunching tackle on the halfway line, Jack Harrison played a gorgeous outside-of-the-boot pass to release Calvert-Lewin, who was brought down by Alisson.\n\nRef Andy Madley pointed to the spot but VAR spotted Calvert-Lewin was offside\n\nA Salah ball across goal was brilliantly cleared by Ben Godfrey.\n\nBut Dyche's side were bossing it - going long, pressing high, in full dogs-of-war mode.\n\nGodfrey sent a free header wide from a Dwight McNeil free-kick and then Calvert-Lewin had another headed effort pushed out by Alisson at point-blank range.\n\nAfter 27 minutes, Everton took a lead which was thoroughly deserved.\n\nDyche's boys won a succession of headers in a goalmouth scramble and Alexis Mac Allister miscued an attempted clearance, allowing Branthwaite to poke his shot under Alisson, off the post and inches over the line.\n\nThere was a lengthy VAR delay, of course. But even Nottingham Forest would agree that Notts County fan David Coote had no reason to rule it out from Stockley Park.\n\nIt was the 16th time Liverpool had conceded first in the Premier League this season, yet more often than not, they'd come back to win.\n\nMac Allister soon opened up Everton with a cunning pass, Salah touched on but Darwin Nunez did what Darwin Nunez does, squandering a big chance by shooting straight at Jordan Pickford.\n\nSoon, Nunez was making chances, heading for Luis Diaz, who also shot too close to Pickford, and then laying off for Salah who miscued one shot, then skied his second attempt.\n\nSlowly but surely, Liverpool were getting a grip and in first-half injury-time, Andy Robertson's angled shot was pushed away by Pickford.\n\nLiverpool were dominating possession early in the second half but a cracking long-range effort from McNeil was pushed away by Alisson.\n\nAnd from the resulting McNeil, Calvert-Lewin leapt like Zebedee on ecstasy, between Van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold, to nut home at the back post.\n\nDiaz crashed a shoot against the inside of the post but that was as close as it got.\n\nThe neighbours had turned up the volume and Liverpool had collapsed amid the din.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Normally they end up creating enough chances that they can afford to miss a few, but when none of the strikers are finishing, it becomes a problem.\n\nSadly, it's become expected that Darwin Nunez will miss an easy chance or two in each game, but that has become even more of an issue as taking or missing chances is the difference between winning a trophy or not.\n\nIn order to win the league, a team needs clinical forwards putting chances away, and firing in goals they wouldn't be expected to score.\n\nNunez has his obvious strengths, but the finishing issue has become even more pertinent as Liverpool become desperate for goals as they challenge for trophies.\n\nThe Reds created two big chances in the first half, and their xG after the first 45 minutes was 1.29, per FotMob.\n\nMohamed Salah and Luis Diaz also missed good opportunities in the opening period, and this kind of wastefulness looks like it will ultimately cost Liverpool a last tilt at the title under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nIt's not all on Nunez, and Salah, as the team's star player -- someone Klopp has described as the club's best finisher by some distance -- has been disappointing in key moments.\n\nAndy Robertson mis-kicking a volley in an offside position summed up the lack of threat.\n\nYou might expect it from a left-back who rarely scores, but the forwards were no better.\n\nPlayers coming back from injury should always be a good thing, but this Liverpool side has looked disjointed as several players have all returned to the team at the same time.\n\nJust as Caoimhin Kelleher was rusty in his early starts deputising for Alisson, Liverpool's No.1 has not looked at his usual world-class best since re-taking his place between the posts and made an error for the first goal.\n\nTrent Alexander-Anold has returned and been an obvious asset, but Liverpool did look like a more orthodox, maybe even more reliable, threat when the playmakers were further forward, as Trent might be were he bombing down the right rather than dropping in.\n\nThere was a togetherness about the patchwork version of Klop's side that doesn't seem to be quite there since players have returned.\n\nAlexis Mac Alister was far from the worst player in red, but his position in midfield can affect so much of the dynamic of Liverpool's play.\n\nHe was second to things in defence, sometimes resorting to fouls, and his long balls were hit and miss in this game.\n\nThis is as much a tactical issue as it is a Mac Allister one. Liverpool spent much of the game with their playmakers too deep.\n\nBy the time Wataru Endo came on in the second half, in an attempt to remedy the situation and push Mac Allister further forward, the game felt like climbing a mountain.\n\nEndo's first touch led to an Everton chance, which summed up the atmosphere into which these substitutes were arriving.\n\nIt was an atmosphere in which Liverpool wilted. The games against Man United and Everton always looked potentially awkward in this run-in, and they proved to be so.\n\nUltimately, the first impressions of this game were what set the tone, and Liverpool's wasn't good enough to silence the Goodison crowd, and gave Everton too much hope.\n\nWhen their team are under the cosh and making mistakes, the Goodison crowd can get on top of their own team in a negative way.\n\nBut when the opposite is true, when the opposition give Everton a chance to not only stay in the game but take the lead in it, the old stadium can be a cauldron.\n\nOnce that happened, Liverpool struggled to silence it. In fact, the mistakes and misses, the annoyance and the complaints from Klopp's players, only gave Everton and their crowd more to cheer.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" sang the Everton fans at the end of the game, and though Liverpool lost the league through a string of bad performances and results, this game will in many ways define the end-of-season collapse.\n\nAll Liverpool can do is win their remaining games, but on this display that in itself looks like it will be a huge challenge.\n\nGames that once would have been looked at and points totted up to see how many they would get in the title challenge, now look more difficult.\n\nWest Ham could pose a similar threat to Everton, while Spurs, Villa, and Wolves have some really good players who could cause Liverpool problems.\n\nIt is safe to say Liverpool's season has petered out, but the players owe it to Klopp to end on a high, even if it won't end it with the trophies they wanted.", "source": {"uri": "thisisanfield.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "This Is Anfield"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_nalton@thisisanfield.com", "name": "James Nalton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thisisanfield.com/wp-content/uploads/P2024-04-24-Everton_Liverpool-90.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

This team is just not ready to compete right at the top again.\n\nFor Everton, it was sheer delight. Their first win over Klopp's Liverpool on home turf. It only took them eight tries.\n\nWith the win so rare for the Toffees fans, they understandably enjoyed themselves. And journalist James Pearce heard a chant from the stands that will make every Reds fan grimace.\n\nThe atmosphere at Goodison can really propel Everton along on nights like these. At times, the toxicity within the ground can work against the players out on the pitch.\n\nBut when they're in good voice, it can be a really hard place to go. Especially for Liverpool.\n\nIn fairness, the Reds didn't help themselves. Klopp was spotted berating his centre-back pairing, who just kept on giving encouragement to Everton.\n\nA goal up within half an hour, the crowd quickly became raucous. The Reds just couldn't live with it.\n\nAfter the second goal went in before the hour, Liverpool never looked like coming back into it. And that's when Pearce took to X to share what he'd heard coming from the home faithful.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" rings around the ground,\" wrote the journalist. Grim.\n\nAlthough Liverpool can mathematically still win the Premier League, it now looks to be beyond them.\n\nArsenal and Manchester City will have taken great heart in this result tonight and are in good form themselves.\n\nThe reality is that the Reds will now need both teams to lose more than one game in the final batch of fixtures. It simply isn't going to happen.\n\nLiverpool did not lose the league at Goodison as the Everton fans would have you believe, it was gone after the defeat against Crystal Palace, really.\n\nHeads need to be picked up and players need to get back to basics.

Very disappointed, frustrated obviously,\" the Liverpool boss said. \"Had now a few injuries.\n\n\"To sum up, it was not good enough. We played the game, or let it happen, what Everton wanted. They scored two goals from set-pieces.\n\n\"The first one we somehow defended three times but in the end we put it on a plate. Branthwaite scored it, didn't even kick the ball properly, but the ball rolls over the line.\n\n\"After that we had our best period, I would say. We really put them under pressure. We created big chances, didn't score.\n\n\"That obviously, going like that into half-time, each situation we missed gave Everton momentum even more. Took it away from us, we never had it, but didn't help.\n\n\"Second half, as well not good enough. Without the real pressure phase we had at the end of the first half.\n\n\"Then you concede second goal. I think everybody who is with Everton saw that goal already 20 times. That's their routine, everybody knows they put the ball there. The player is completely free. I didn't see it back but pretty sure we could have defended that better.\n\n\"It's 2-0, the atmosphere, we played like we played. Obviously not the most inspired performance of all times.\n\n\"I really feel for the people, I am really sorry for that. That's how it is. People told me so often about the great record, especially before the derby, but you never win here. But we never lost and that feels really different.\n\n\"I really apologise for that. It was absolutely unnecessary but it happened. We cannot change it anymore.\"\n\nKlopp continued: \"Now we have to recover because the quickest of all turnarounds is waiting for us. Can imagine it will be a challenge, mentally and physically.\n\n\"Physically was clear. If you win a game then the mental turnaround is obviously not a massive problem. But we now have both things to do.\n\n\"And probably West Ham is waiting and rubbing their hands and hoping that we come there on one leg.

His last trip to Goodison Park was his worst.\n\n\"On a night when Everton had multiple reasons to celebrate, they saw off Klopp with the result that all but secures them a 71st consecutive season of top-flight football and may in effect finish off Liverpool's title challenge.\n\n\"'You lost the league at Goodison Park,' chorused the Evertonians.

But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.While the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.That fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached a ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.\n\nWith Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.\n\nSecond-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.\n\nThird-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton on Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.\n\nIt hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February.\n\nBack then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.\n\nInstead, the end of Klopp's nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although

In midfield Alexis Mac Allister was regularly hurried out of possession while the front three did not give the impression of knowing what the goal even looked like with Darwin Nunez woefully below the level required.\n\nThe hosts' positive approach seemed to have paid off after just six minutes when Calvert-Lewin was brought down by Alisson Becker after nicking Jack Harrison's outside-of-the-boot pass past him but the penalty was rescinded after VAR ruled the striker was offside.\n\nThe goal Everton deserved came in the 27th minute when Branthwaite forced the ball under Alisson and in off the post after Liverpool made a mess of clearing a free-kick with Konate getting in the way of Mac Allister.\n\nPickford then came to the fore as Nunez blasted at him rather than opting for the more open left side of the goal, then blocked Diaz's volley with his legs from Nunez's nod on and finally stuck out an arm to repel Robertson's shot from a narrow angle.\n\nAnother poor performance from Salah saw him scuff a shot into Branthwaite, sparing him the embarrassment of seeing it sail wide, but then slashed the rebound into the Gwladys Street.\n\nIn keeping with the emerging pattern over recent weeks Liverpool faded after the break after Virgil van Dijk headed straight at Pickford and when McNeil's long-range shot was tipped over, Calvert-Lewin rose unchallenged at the far post to nod home the resulting corner.\n\nDyche and his team had done a brilliant job of exposing Liverpool's weakness as that was the sixth successive time Klopp's side had failed to win the first ball at a set-piece.\n\nBranthwaite could have added further embarrassment but headed wide while the closest Liverpool came to a response was when Diaz's curling shot rebounded off the post and they played out the final minutes with 'you lost the league at Goodison Park' ringing around the ground.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

I mean, that is the name of the game for Everton,' the Reds legend said on Sky Sports at half-time of the match.\n\n'Everton have been fantastic, certainly with the set pieces, they've looked like scoring on every single one.\n\n'The amount of times Liverpool have given fouls away in their own half and Konate, what is he doing?!

Jarrad Branthwaite netted Everton's first, before Dominic Calvert-Lewin then added another with a towering header. Liverpool struggled to break down Everton's resilient defense, with missed chances and poor defending all but ending their title hopes.\n\nEverton took a huge step to Premier League survival and stuck a dagger in the heart of Liverpool's title bid with a dogged 2-0 win at Goodison Park on Wednesday evening.\n\nA frantic start highlighted the need for points in both teams' campaigns. The hostile, vitriol-brewing home crowd were vying to put another nail in the coffin of Jurgen Klopp's fairytale farewell tour with a defiant act of schadenfreude, and that looked to have worked when Dominic Calvert-Lewin won a penalty after just six minutes.\n\nHowever, VAR intervened and adjudged him to have been offside from Jack Harrison's trivela through ball. Though it was the Toffees who deservedly went ahead - pinball in the box saw Jarrad Branthwaite strike towards goal, with his shot creeping under Alisson and in off the post to send Goodison delirious. Liverpool huffed and puffed, battling hard to find an equaliser, but glorious chances missed from Darwin Nunez and Andy Robertson made it seem like it wouldn't be their day.\n\nThat was compounded on the hour; some horrific Liverpool defending from a corner saw Dominic Calvert-Lewin with the freedom of Stanley Park to nod home at the back post, and from there it was an uphill battle for the Reds. Diaz hit the post as the game entered the business end, but the Reds found it so hard to break down a resilient Everton side under the lights - and that has seen them likely surrender their title hopes.\n\nEverton\n\nStats\n\nLiverpool\n\n7\n\nShots on target\n\n8\n\n6\n\nShots off target\n\n4\n\n24\n\nPossession\n\n76\n\n6\n\nFouls\n\n13\n\n4\n\nCorner kicks\n\n13\n\n0\n\nYellow cards\n\n3\n\nEverton Player Ratings GK - Jordan Pickford - 8/10\n\nOutstanding save from Darwin Nunez just after the half-hour mark. The authority he showed gave the Toffees' defence the confidence to go on and perform the way they did.\n\nRB - Ben Godfrey - 7/10\n\nGreat awareness from the stand-in right-back to deny Curtis Jones from turning home after nine minutes. Should've scored shortly after, but it was a great performance from a player who doesn't play all too often.\n\nCB - James Tarkowski - 9/10\n\nOutstanding tackle that set up the early penalty incident, one that Gary Neville said came from \"1986\". Had enough chances in the area in the opening stages and will be disappointed he didn't tuck one away, but he was everything you would want in a centre-back on a huge night at Goodison.\n\nCB - Jarrad Branthwaite - 8/10\n\nEngland squad-bound and could be on the move in the summer, but he's a player that the Toffees faithful will cherish until he does depart. Got the opener and dominated in the Liverpool area\n\nLB - Vitaliy Mykolenko - 7/10\n\nLooked to be in real pain after an ankle injury that replays initially didn't show but battled on bravely. He's becoming more and more of a dependable defender as his Goodison stint goes on. Subbed at half-time due to the injury.\n\nRM - Jack Harrison - 7/10\n\nStarted the game superbly and was so unfortunate not to have found Calvert-Lewin in an onside position for the early penalty incident. Worked tirelessly against Liverpool's wing-backs and was decent going forward.\n\nCM - Idrissa Gueye - 8/10\n\nThe experienced midfielder was absolutely everywhere, winning crunching tackles and breaking up Liverpool attacks early doors. If he had a touch more composure, he'd be an outstanding midfielder, but you couldn't ask for much more from the Senegalese star.\n\nCM - James Garner - 6/10\n\nThe game wasn't one for Garner with Everton's direct approach bypassing the midfield, but his tireless efforts didn't go unnoticed.\n\nLM - Dwight McNeil - 7/10\n\nLively and more than held his own against Alexander-Arnold. Quietly went about as one of Everton's best performers on the night, and stung the gloves of Alisson from range before grabbing an assist from the resulting corner.\n\nCF - Abdoulaye Doucoure - 5/10\n\nPossibly the only Everton player who wasn't quite up to scratch. Just before half-time, it was clear that he wasn't working in tandem with Calvert-Lewin, with the duo failing to link up and keep hold of the ball despite Liverpool onslaughts.\n\nST - Dominic Calvert-Lewin - 9/10\n\nNot many can beat Virgil van Dijk in the air, but the Toffees' frontman was superb in that regard. Unfortunate not to win a penalty, he was millimetres from turning Branthwaite's goal in. Konate will be having nightmares about him and he scored the all-important second. Imperious aerially.\n\nSub - Ashley Young - 6/10\n\nCame on for Mykolenko after his injury and was generally sturdy at left-back after his controversial outing against Nottingham Forest.\n\nSub - Amadou Onana - 5/10\n\nCame on for Gueye in a bid to have fresh legs and tackling nous in the centre of the park.\n\nSub - Youssef Chermiti - N/A\n\nCame on for Dominic Calvert-Lewin with 90 seconds to go. Not on long enough to award a rating.\n\nLiverpool Player Ratings GK - Alisson Becker - 6/10\n\nFortunate not to have given away a penalty but bravely got to Calvert-Lewin's header. Perhaps should've saved Branthwaite's strike, but nothing he could do about the second.\n\nRB - Trent Alexander-Arnold - 5/10\n\nCreatively lacking. Picked out Mohamed Salah for a chance that should have resulted in a goal, and the opener wasn't his fault. But whilst he is usually one of the brighter sparks for Liverpool, his lack of creativity was apparent.\n\nCB - Ibrahima Konate - 4/10\n\nA very inferior performance against Calvert-Lewin. The Frenchman was second-best and bullied, which is very much unlike him. Subbed just after the hour after a horror show.\n\nCB - Virgil van Dijk - 5/10\n\nSimilar to Konate, it just wasn't his night. Booked for dissent and didn't exude the authority that he usually does on a weekly basis - and a lack of marking from the second-half corner saw Calvert-Lewin go free. One to forget.\n\nLB - Andrew Robertson - 4/10\n\nRobertson failed to produce his usual energetic best. The Scot was finding the right positions, but his final ball just lacked the panache to find its way through to the Reds' attack. Missed a sitter in the second half to equalise and couldn't get going.\n\nCM - Alexis Mac Allister - 5/10\n\nUnusually sloppy from the Argentine. Had a hand in the first goal though, in fairness, a lack of a defensive-minded midfielder may have been Liverpool's downfall with no support for Konate or Van Dijk.\n\nCM - Dominik Szoboszlai - 6/10\n\nFound himself in some decent positions and was arguably Liverpool's biggest creative threat on the night. But he needs to add more to his tally if he is to become a top Premier League player, and that was evidenced tonight.\n\nCAM - Curtis Jones - 6/10\n\nClumsy start from the boyhood Red, but slowly grew into the game. Tidy at times, but he didn't seem to have any influence on the game all in all.\n\nRW - Mohamed Salah - 5/10\n\nHas been off the boil for a few weeks and that continued. You would always count on him in these situations, but he didn't have any of his usual burst of pace. Little to shout about.\n\nST - Darwin Nunez - 3/10\n\nEntirely anonymous throughout the clash. First touch was not there all night, and he should have scored a gilt-edged chance on the half hour. Another performance that will only add to his doubters.\n\nLW - Luis Diaz - 6/10\n\nDidn't find much luck against Godfrey's pace, though he looked to be Liverpool's best outlet. Hit the post with a venomous strike with 20 minutes to go.\n\nSub - Wataru Endo - 5/10\n\nBrought on in a flurry of changes but almost gave Dwight McNeil the chance to make it 3-0.\n\nSub - Harvey Elliott - 5/10\n\nCame on to influence the game in the pockets but couldn't muster chances against a physical Toffees side who were shutting up shop.\n\nSub - Jarell Quansah - 5/10\n\nCame on for the struggling Konate to deal with Calvert-Lewin.\n\nSub - Kostas Tsimikas - 4/10\n\nEnded Robertson's nightmare by replacing him with 10 minutes to go\n\nSub - Joe Gomez - 4/10\n\nBaffling substitution to replace Alexander-Arnold when you're chasing two goals, but the Englishman did well on the right-flank.\n\nMan of the Match James Tarkowski\n\nThis was such a toss-up between Calvert-Lewin and Tarkowski - but a superb defensive performance just edged it, despite Calvert-Lewin's heroics. Tarkowski didn't play a part in the opener and missed the boat on quite a few chances in the first half - but defensively, he was incredible.\n\nEvery ball that was crossed into the box seemed to be dealt with by the one-time England cap, and if the Three Lions are under the cosh at the Euros, you would definitely have Tarkowski up there as one of the options to come on. Whether Gareth Southgate takes him is another story, but having dealt with a star-studded line-up with ease, he certainly impressed.\n\nBrave in the tackle, impeccable in the air and barking out orders to keep his defensive shape in line, Tarkowski has been a superb signing on a free transfer for the Toffees and fans will be hoping he stays at the club for a prolonged period. Essentially, if he hadn't performed the way he did, it may not have given Everton that springboard to win.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"},

We should have done better and we didn't and that's why we lost,\" Klopp said.\n\nThe loss keeps Liverpool three points behind league leader Arsenal in second place and one ahead of defending champion Manchester City, which is in third and has two games in hand on both of its rivals.\n\nKlopp had spoken last week of needing perfection to win his second title at the club. But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted,\" Klopp said.\n\nKlopp had dominated this fixture since taking over at Anfield in 2015, winning nine of the past 16 derbies before Wednesday's match.\n\nStatistics showed Everton won 75% of all duels in the opening half hour, a league record for any top flight team this season.\n\nAfter just six minutes, Liverpool was grateful for VAR as it escaped an early penalty when Alisson brought down Calvert-Lewin in the box and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot. The decision was overturned because of an offside in the build up.\n\nThat pressure was made to count when Everton took the lead in in the 27th. Liverpool's defenders repeatedly failed to clear the danger from a free kick and Branthwaite's shot squirmed through the hands of Alisson and off the post before crossing the line.\n\nAgain there was an agonizing wait for a VAR check, but on this occasion there was no reprieve for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz had the chance to level before the break, but was denied by the legs of Jordan Pickford from close range.\n\nLiverpool came out with more intent for the second half without forcing Pickford into serious action before conceding a second goal.\n\nAgain the visitors failed to deal with a set piece when Dwight McNeil swung a deep corner to the far post and Calvert-Lewin rose unmarked to head home.\n\nLiverpool came close to pulling one back in the 69th, but Diaz's effort came back off the post.\n\nUNITED SCARE\n\nManchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat last-place Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry in the FA Cup semifinals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in its bid qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz in each half at Old Trafford. But Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st and and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited is up to sixth in the standings, 13 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa.\n\nPALACE SAFE\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle.\n\nPalace is on 39 points -- 14 clear of 18th-place Luton, which can only pick up a maximum of 37 if it wins its last four games of the season.\n\nIt was Palace's third-straight win to erase fears of being relegated. Defeat saw Newcastle drop to seventh.\n\nBournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 at Molineux through Antoine Semenyo's first-half strike.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And while there are only two home games remaining, one other assignment in the city now looms large for the Liverpool boss.\n\nThat comes at Goodison this evening when Klopp takes charge of his 19th and final Merseyside derby with both the Reds and Everton in need of three points for vastly contrasting reasons.\n\nFor Liverpool, there is the desire to keep pace with both Manchester City and Arsenal as the Premier League title race reaches a thrilling conclusion. And on the other side of Stanley Park, victory would arguably banish any lingering fears of relegation after yet another season hovering above the drop zone.\n\nREAD MORE: Jurgen Klopp sends warning Liverpool players after 'over the top' Everton derby moments\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool new manager latest as Feyenoord boss Arne Slot becomes leading contender\n\nKlopp can boast an impressive record against Everton, having lost only one of his previous 18 derbies as Liverpool manager, the 2-0 Anfield reverse behind closed doors in February 2021 to a visiting side helmed by Carlo Ancelotti. His record at Goodison has seen two wins - the most recent a 4-1 romp in December 2021 - and five draws.\n\nBut when the German packs his bags and bids farewell to Merseyside next month, the scraps to claim local bragging rights will not be among the things he misses too much.\n\n\"Around the derby is just pressure,\" he says. \"The pressure is higher so why should the joy be higher? You win it, great, but why should I miss the pressure around it? This time, when you're really playing for something, that's the pressure. But when you are both not in a great moment, it's the one game you have to win, definitely. That kind of pressure - why would I miss that? It's not enjoyable.\n\n\"Everyone else can only watch it and think 'oh my God, it looks exciting'. But somebody has to make the decisions, somebody has to do this, somebody has to do that.\n\n\"So many people visit me always around the games and say 'we will not see that anymore or that anymore' and I just want to tell you - I work all the time while you just come here and watch the games. I'm constantly in it, even when the game is over I can't switch off. It's not great to be in this situation all the time.\n\n\"Maybe other people enjoy that more than me. But that's something I definitely will not miss.\"\n\nHaving been part of the historic fixture - tonight is the 244th meeting between the two teams - for the best part of a decade, Klopp accepts he cannot in future observe from a neutral standpoint.\n\n\"I will never be able to watch a Merseyside derby without any kind of (emotion),\" he says. \"I feel exactly the same as everybody else around these games, but as long as I'm involved, I have to be calm. But if I am just watching it, then I will feel a different kind of emotion, definitely. I want Liverpool to win all of them, definitely. That means it's important. I know so many people where the game means everything to them.\n\n\"I don't know when I can start enjoying watching football, we will see that. I might give it a try at the Euros!\"\n\nThe relentless schedule and the pursuit of honours - Liverpool saw their Europa League hopes ended last Thursday when a 1-0 win at Atalanta wasn't enough to avoid a quarter-final exit on aggregate - has meant Klopp has had little time to dwell on what life will be after he leaves Anfield.\n\nBut it appears the Reds boss will welcome the break. \"I have no idea at the moment what I will miss, but it feels like I won't miss a lot of the things for plenty of reasons,\" says Klopp.\n\n\"I had my last European game last week, yes we didn't go through and you can make a big story of it being my last game, but I just tried to figure out how I felt, and it was nothing. It's not like I felt I would never have a European game again - if that would be the case, then I wouldn't stop it.\n\n\"I had 1,000 games as a manager, probably more than 100 European games, so what do you want? 300? 500? I don't know how many you have to have to be happy with what you did. That's really not my problem. I've played for the last time at Old Trafford, the last time against City away, at home as well, I just don't feel these kind of things. Not yet.\"\n\nKlopp may not miss the Merseyside derby.

Liverpool's performance was so abysmal that a defeated Klopp came out in his press conference and issued an apology to the Liverpool supporters.\n\nEarlier this season, Jurgen Klopp had announced that come the end of this season, he will be putting an end to his memorable stint with Liverpool which saw him win the UEFA Champions League and break Liverpool's 30 year drought for the Premier League crown.\n\nIt was only in March that Liverpool were sitting at the top of the Premier League table and were in contention to win the quadruple (League Cup, Europa League, Premier League, FA Cup). However raking up just four wins in their\n\nBut with just four matches left to play in this season it seems like Jurgen Klopp's final season at Anfield will have no grand farewell as the German's stint will end with only a league cup crown.\n\nWhere it all went wrong for Liverpool, Image/X\n\nSo where did it all go wrong for Liverpool?\n\nBad Habit of Starting Clumsy\n\nThe story of the season for Liverpool had been their ability to pull out rabbit out of the hat moments as on countless occasions they came back to win games late on in the season.\n\nWhile at the start they were being lauded as 'mentality monsters' winning an astonishing 27 points this season in the Premier League but in the past few weeks that resilience has faded and they have been unable to overcome deficits.\n\nThe warning signs were there as Liverpool had conceded the opening goals on 22 occasions this season. Given the late goals are not coming anymore the habit of starting Clumsy has proved to be catastrophic.\n\nAlso Read | Van Dijk BLASTS Liverpool teammates after embarrassing Derby loss\n\nAttacking Stars Misfiring\n\nThe biggest concern for Liverpool in their barren spell has been the lack of form of their star Egyptian winger Mohammed Salah. To give a breif picture Liverpool hasn't scored a goal from open play in four of their last five matches.\n\nLiverpool Winger Mohammed Salah, Image/AP\n\nEver since returning from AFCON duties, Salah has been a bystander in Liverpool's attack and to make matters even worse there are questions over whether their 100m forward Darwin Nunez is the right fit at Anfield anymore or not.\n\nShocking Cup Runs\n\nThe biggest issue for Liverpool in their quest for the Premier League has been their FA Cup and Europa League shockers.\n\nThe team seem to have been startled by their heartbreaking defeat in the final minute of Extra Time at the hands of Manchester United in the FA Cup. The Europa League quarter-final hammering against Atalanta further put the nail in coffin for Liverpool's momentum.\n\nThe team never seemed to recover from those defeats and have simply ran out of gas towards the crucial part of the season.\n\nAlso Read | Xavi commits to Barcelona coaching role till 2025 in a surprising U-turn\n\nThe Buck Stops at Manager\n\nEventually, the Buck always comes down to the manager and Jurgen Klopp in his final few weeks has cut out a dejected figure on the sidelines.\n\nContrary to Klopp's time at Liverpool where he was known for showing passion, guile and was always in the referee or the opposition's ear, Klopp is simply looking running on fumes on the dugouts.

The Merseyside Derby clash ended in bitter disappointment for Klopp and his squad, marking a significant setback in their quest for Premier League glory.\n\nLiverpool's defeat to Everton left Klopp visibly disheartened, as his side collapsed against their local rivals. The loss not only dented Liverpool's confidence but also dealt a severe blow to their title hopes. With just four games remaining in the season, Liverpool now find themselves trailing league leaders Arsenal by a mere three points, adding further pressure to their already challenging campaign.\n\nJurgen Klopp's post-match reflection\n\nIn the aftermath of the defeat, Klopp offered a candid assessment of Liverpool's performance and their slim chances of clinching the title. Speaking to Sky Sports, Klopp expressed his disappointment and acknowledged the team's shortcomings:\n\n\"Arsenal and Manchester City must have a very bad moment. I don't know. I can only apologise for today to the people. We should have done better but we didn't and that's why we lost. Obviously very disappointed about a lot of things. We let it happen, then it became exactly the game Everton wanted.\"\n\n\"But we were not good enough, that's what we have to admit. I didn't expect that today but it happened. Obviously it's not the greatest moment we are it but you have to fight through, try to get the momentum back.\"\n\nKlopp's candid admission reflects the gravity of Liverpool's situation, as they grapple with the reality of falling short in their pursuit of silverware. Despite his disappointment, Klopp remained hopeful, emphasizing the need for his team to regroup and fight through adversity to regain momentum.\n\nThe defeat at the hands of Everton marked a historic moment for the Toffees, who secured their first home victory against Liverpool in the Premier League since October 2010. Everton's triumph not only bolstered their own fortunes but also added salt to Liverpool's wounds, exacerbating the disappointment of their Merseyside rivals' resurgence.\n\nLiverpool's road to redemption\n\nLiverpool faces a daunting task ahead as they seek to bounce back from their defeat against Everton. With a crucial fixture against West Ham on the horizon, Klopp's side must quickly regroup and rediscover their winning form to keep their title hopes alive. As Arsenal and Manchester City continue their pursuit of the title, Liverpool's margin for error diminishes, underscoring the importance of every remaining fixture in their quest for glory.\n\nAs the Premier League season nears its end, Liverpool's fate hangs in the balance. With pivotal matches against West Ham and other top contenders looming, Klopp's squad faces a critical point in their campaign. As Arsenal clashes with Tottenham and Manchester City contends with Brighton and Nottingham Forest, the title race intensifies, adding further drama to an already gripping season.\n\nJurgen Klopp's leadership will be tested in the coming weeks as Liverpool navigates through challenging circumstances. With their title hopes hanging by a thread, Klopp must rally his squad and instill belief as they strive to overcome the odds and emerge triumphant in the face of adversity. As Liverpool prepares for the battles ahead, the resilience and determination of Klopp's team will define their season's legacy.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Liverpool-news-Jurgen-Klopp-gets-brutally-honest-on-Premier-League-chances.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-10-", "textStart": 1989, "textEnd": 2001}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

was tipped over, Calvert-Lewin rose unchallenged at the far post to nod home the resulting corner.\n\nDyche and his team had done a brilliant job of exposing Liverpool's weakness as that was the sixth successive time Klopp's side had failed to win the first ball at a set-piece.\n\nBranthwaite could have added further embarrassment but headed wide while the closest Liverpool came to a response was when Diaz's curling shot rebounded off the post and they played out the final minutes with 'you lost the league at Goodison Park' ringing around the ground.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 24

In truth, Klopp was let down by his players in a derby display that was all too timid at times - but the boss was guilty of his own errors.\n\nA lack of intensity proved particularly damaging for the visitors, but that's an area in which Klopp can only have so much influence. Daily Star Sport considers some of those factors the German did have control over but failed to manage correctly.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Liverpool lost the Merseyside derby and had two men sent off - I shouldn't have played'\n\nREAD MORE: What Arne Slot is really like - from stars who played under possible next Liverpool boss\n\nPlaying Everton's game\n\nIt was almost immediately evident how Dyche and his men were approaching the midweek derby duel, bringing an intensity and pace that Liverpool struggled to match. But therein laid the problem, as tying the Toffees' all-action methods should never have been the objective.\n\nToo often were the Reds caught out in the race to play things at 100 miles per hour, and the mistakes that came as a result were only too predictable. Just see Alexis Mac Allister's fluffed attempt to clear his lines before gifting Jarrad Branthwaite his chance for the game's opening goal.\n\nWill Liverpool win the Premier League? Let us know in the comments section below.\n\nAnd that's where Klopp should have intervened (preferably prior to that breakthrough) to urge his players to take said pace out of the game, confident in the notion Liverpool would find their openings in time. Instead, the game of catch-up only worsened when Dominic Calvert-Lewin doubled Everton's advantage, forcing Liverpool further into the hosts' hands.\n\nNo Endo, No Party\n\nOne area in which Liverpool looked inferior from the first whistle was midfield, where the trio of Curtis Jones, Mac Allister and Dominik Szobozslai were rendered ineffective by their Toffees counterparts. It's that much easier to say in hindsight, but that engine room was always lacking a certain bite that Everton carried in spades.\n\nKlopp's team have performed their best this season when Wataru Endo has filled in the 'Fabinho role'. Granted, the Japan international doesn't have the same verve on the ball as a Jones or Szobozslai, but players can't showcase that skill without the ball.\n\nIn the end, Idrissa Gana Gueye and James Garner had a field day in edging the intensity battle in what proved the most critical part of the pitch. Starting Endo may have slowed things down slightly, but the added possession Liverpool would have gleaned thanks to his presence would have paid dividends.\n\nDarwin's Theory\n\nKlopp has displayed avid affection for Darwin Nunez since his \u00a364million arrival at the club, even when many fans have called for the player to be dropped. The Uruguayan has rewarded that faith with a career-best scoring season in England - though his goal ratio is actually very similar to that of his debut campaign.\n\nMuch to the joy of Everton's defence, Nunez was again the preferred option up front on Wednesday. And the centre-back pairing of Branthwaite and James Tarkowski in particular had all too straightforward a job in muting the hothead altogether.\n\nAfter all, it's not as though Cody Gakpo was brought to Anfield s a bench option, and the Dutchman's nuance working the channels could have offered more trouble on this occasion. Some Liverpool have even been calling for academy wonderkid Jayden Danns to receive his shot in the first team, though that's perhaps a risk too far for this point in the campaign.\n\nSlow subs\n\nIn line with the logic that Klopp got some of his selections wrong in the first place, it only compounded things when the man pulling the strings was slow to correct course. As if the first half wasn't evidence enough that the Reds needed swift change, the boss allowed the stagnation to carry on for nearly 20 minutes of the second half before making his first swaps.\n\nHad he switched things up at the half-time interval, Liverpool might have prevented themselves falling two goals behind in what was the nail in the coffin given their dismal finishing up front. By that point, however, the game was already gone as they failed to find anything resembling space around the Toffees area.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_sunderland@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Tom Sunderland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabinho_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fabinho (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Tarkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Danns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Danns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrissa_Gueye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idrissa Gueye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32665251.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS331351014.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin struck in either half on a night where Liverpool were second best by a distance.\n\nAfter a dire opening 27 minutes where they were overpowered by Sean Dyche's side, Branthwaite put the Toffees deservedly in front. But on the stroke of half-time, with Liverpool in the ascendency, Nunez had the opportunity to put them in level at the break with a guilt-edged chance.\n\nBut the Uruguayan missed, Liverpool went in behind, lost their momentum, and found themselves two down before the hour mark after a lacklustre start to the second period.\n\nCarragher was scathing in his assessment of Liverpool's No.9 and his oft-wayward finishing.\n\n\"The chance that Nunez misses before half-time, that is unforgivable at this level,\" said the ex-Liverpol captain. \"That is not acceptable at this level, certainly when Liverpool are going for the title.\"\n\nAnd Carragher would go further, wondering if, after two years on Merseyside, and 33 goals in 92 games for the club, it might be time for Liverpool to cut ties with the ex-Benfica hitman already this summer.\n\n\"I think there is a question to ask,\" he added. \"You want him to do well because there is so much that you like because he gives everything, he runs and causes trouble and gets the odd goal and gets an assist.\n\n\"But after two years when Liverpool this season are going to the title and those big games, you need your man to score away at Old Trafford, away at Goodison, in the European game at Atalanta. There is no time to waste, this is not October or November. This is the business end\n\nDarwin Nunez of Liverpool speaks with manager Jurgen Klopp after the final whistle\n\n\"In terms of Nunez and where the club go forward now, we have all been in squads where someone comes in and maybe you talk about the first year and maybe say, okay he's getting up to speed with and he's improving, and it looked like he was at the start of the season. But it has ground to a halt.\n\n\"You are looking at it now and after two years, I don't think there is going to be a massive improvement in him. What we have seen in the last two years is what he is.\n\n\"He can cause trouble, he can be erratic with his finishing. I don't think it is going to be enough to win you the biggest trophies so I think there is a big decision to be made on him in the summer.\"\n\nWho will win the Premier League title? Have your say in the comments section\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil van Dijk admitted he was disappointed in his side's showing and said a few of his team-mates need to have a serious think about whether they put in the effort required after being overrun by their hosts.\n\n\"Very disappointed in so many ways,\" he said. \"Everyone has to look in the mirror and look at their own performance and think if they gave everything.\n\n\"Do they really want to win the league? If you play like this overall in the game and not win any challenges and give the referee an opportunity to give a free-kick away then we have no chance to win the title.\n\n\"We have to do much better.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

But this was the latest setback for his team, which has lost two of its last three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\nKlopp had dominated this fixture since taking over at Anfield in 2015, winning nine of the past 16 derbies before Wednesday's match.\n\nStatistics showed Everton won 75% of all duels in the opening half hour, a league record for any top flight team this season.\n\nAfter just six minutes, Liverpool was grateful for VAR as it escaped an early penalty when Alisson brought down Calvert-Lewin in the box and referee Andrew Madley pointed to the spot. The decision was overturned because of an offside in the build up.\n\nThat pressure was made to count when Everton took the lead in in the 27th. Liverpool's defenders repeatedly failed to clear the danger from a free kick and Branthwaite's shot squirmed through the hands of Alisson and off the post before crossing the line.\n\nAgain there was an agonizing wait for a VAR check, but on this occasion there was no reprieve for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz had the chance to level before the break, but was denied by the legs of Jordan Pickford from close range.\n\nLiverpool came out with more intent for the second half without forcing Pickford into serious action before conceding a second goal.\n\nAgain the visitors failed to deal with a set piece when Dwight McNeil swung a deep corner to the far post and Calvert-Lewin rose unmarked to head home.\n\nLiverpool came close to pulling one back in the 69th, but Diaz's effort came back off the post.\n\nUNITED SCARE\n\nManchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat last-place Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry in the FA Cup semifinals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in its bid qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton in each half at Old Trafford. But Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st and and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited is up to sixth in the standings, 13 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa.\n\nPALACE SAFE\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle.\n\nPalace is on 39 points -- 14 clear of 18th-place Luton, which can only pick up a maximum of 37 if it wins its last four games of the season.\n\nIt was Palace's third-straight win to erase fears of being relegated. Defeat saw Newcastle drop to seventh.\n\nBournemouth beat Wolves 1-0 at Molineux through Antoine Semenyo's first-half strike.\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\nAP soccer:

Defending champions Manchester City is third, five points back of Arsenal. But with two games in hand on both the pacesetters and Liverpool, Pep Guardiola's City remains the favorite to claim an unprecedented fourth consecutive English title.\n\nKlopp, who in 2019 led Liverpool to its first league triumph in 30 years, announced in January that he would leave Anfield at season's end after almost a decade. The Reds have yet to name a successor for the wildly popular German manager, though Feyenoord's Dutch coach Arne Slot has emerged as the frontrunner in recent days according to reports in Europe.\n\nWednesday's win was as important for Everton as it was deflating for Liverpool. The Toffees -- who snapped a five-game winless streak in the Merseyside derby -- are one of just six clubs never to have been relegated since the Premier League's inaugural 1992-93 season. But the club have been battling the drop this campaign since November, when they were docked a Prem-record 10 points for breaching financial rules. The penalty was later reduced to six points, though further two points were taken away earlier this month. Everton is now in 16th place, eights points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool now must win each of its remaining four games and hope Arsenal and Man City slip up multiple times to have any realistic chance of claiming a 20th English crown next month.

AP\n\nLiverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.\n\nWith Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.\n\nSecond-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.\n\nThird-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton on Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.\n\nIt is hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February.\n\nBack then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.\n\nInstead, the end of Klopp's nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.\n\n\"Arsenal and Manchester City must have a very bad moment,\" Klopp said when asked if Liverpool can win the title.\n\n\"I don't know. I can only apologise for today to the people. We should have done better but we didn't.\"\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nFernandes to the rescue\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shootout win after blowing a three-goal lead against second-tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\n\"I think we played quite well, also creating many more chances. Many positives. But also negatives. Conceding two goals from giveaways. It's unacceptable. We want to play dynamic, attacking football,\" Ten Hag said.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nAttwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle.\n\nMateta broke the deadlock in the 55th minute and added the second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of qualifying for Europe.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [],

The Reds are now three points adrift of league leaders Arsenal, with a significantly worse goal difference, and although they sit a point above City, Pep Guardiola's side have two games in hand.\n\n\"I can only apologise for today to the people. It is very disappointing. We played the game Everton wanted and they scored two goals from set-pieces. We should have done better but we didn't,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"No good thoughts at all. Very disappointed and frustrated. It was not good enough.\n\n\"It was not the most inspired performance of all time, I really feel for the people. We never lost here (it was Everton's first Goodison derby win in almost 14 years) and it feels really different. I really apologise for that.\"\n\nOn the title race, Klopp admitted Liverpool now need things to go drastically wrong at Arsenal and City. He said: \"I can't say now that we are still fully in it; we need a crisis at Man City and Arsenal and need to win football games because if they start losing all their games and we do what we did tonight nothing changes.\"\n\nREAD MORE: How Arsenal can complete 22-year Premier League title dream vs Man Utd in historical repeat\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal have two hidden North London Derby motivations vs Tottenham in Premier League title race\n\n\"We are not safe in the Champions League as well so we should just play better football. It is not a problem of attitude or what the boys want. No one is doing that on purpose.\n\n\"It is my job to bring them into a situation where they feel confident to do that. That part I am responsible and I am responsible for what happened tonight.\"\n\n\"It is not that I feel great, that is the most tricky part of football obviously. In the moment it didn't work out and we have to keep trying.\"\n\nA triumph for Everton lent them an eight-point buffer over 18th-ranked Luton, whom they still have yet to face, thus all but cementing their Premier League status. \"Pleased obviously, delighted with the performance against a top side, delighted for the Evertonians and the old-school Toffees,\" said manager Sean Dyche.\n\n\"They were terrific. Terrific on Sunday. I am pleased for the club, only the second win in 30 (derbies) I am told.\"\n\n\"I think the game was won in the tactical delivery of the team.

For the Merseyside derby defeat to Everton there were six changes to follow on from the half-dozen made for Sunday's win over Fulham. On this occasion, however, it did not work.\n\nThe latter weeks of the season are a tricky balance for any coach with so much at stake. Trying to maintain a rhythm and build momentum while keeping everyone fresh for crucial fixtures is an unenviable task. It cannot help a manager when hours before the match a starter withdraws but not even the riches of football can dictate when a mother-to-be enters labour.\n\nSean Dyche knew there was fatigue in the Liverpool ranks, considering Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez was making his 50th appearance of the season for his club, in addition to the air miles involved for Europa League travel and the international breaks in South America. Everton's most-used player is James Tarkowski, who has played 41 times, and not troubled Gareth Southgate in the process.\n\nNow Dyche has ditched his suit to become a tracksuit manager, it seems more fitting that his team have increased their work rate and physicality under the gaze of their personal trainer, rather than a bouncer. The instructions were clear: to play on the physical and mental tiredness within the Liverpool squad.\n\nIn the early stages Everton pressed relentlessly, letting those in red know the game was unlikely to be enjoyable despite the 14-place and 38-point difference in the standings before kick-off.\n\nA tired child, as Cody Gakpo is about to find out, is liable to get frustrated and angry as their bodies fight it, something Dyche wanted to exacerbate in Liverpool.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin, recovered from injury sustained on Sunday, was tasked with being the irritant striker, chasing Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Virgil van Dijk, ensuring each press included contact. They were not fouls but, like a flea bite, the more received, the more irksome the matter became.\n\nOne key ploy for Everton was to buy free-kicks anywhere from the halfway line onwards. Two Dwight McNeil set pieces resulted in the goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin as Liverpool failed to deal with the height and power of Everton in the box. Andrew Madley obliged whenever a blue shirt was touched, much to Liverpool's chagrin, explaining why Van Dijk's remonstrating earned him a yellow. It was an accumulation of issues that saw the Dutchman vent at the referee.\n\nEverton disrupted the Liverpool gameplan. The visitors became quickly distracted by the shock tactics on show from the repeated free-kicks into the box and the multi-ball system that ensured Liverpool could not switch off, even if their brains were eager for a rest and blue shirts buzzed around them. In midfield Liverpool's trio were disjointed, unable to cope with the battle they had walked into. Curtis Jones and Dominik Szoboszlai departed after just over an hour of Everton ferocity, with little to show for their war wounds. Whenever Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 motored through the middle, he was able to brush aside all-comers with ease.\n\nLiverpool had 76% of possession but were met with nine blue shirts - Calvert-Lewin did not retreat - and despite their best efforts, it was difficult to find a way through. In the final stages, few had the energy to attack for Liverpool as their attempts to progress up the pitch became more direct. The quick, sharp passing that has been instrumental this season was lost with minds and legs depleted of resources.\n\nAs has often been the case in recent weeks, Liverpool have created chances but lacked the clinical finishes required. N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Luis D\u00edaz were foiled by Jordan Pickford in the first half, while the Colombian hit the inside of the post in the second. There are fine lines when scoring and a tired mind can make the difference. Diogo Jota's and Mohamed Salah's injuries during the season have put more pressure on N\u00fa\u00f1ez and D\u00edaz, limiting Klopp's level of rotation in his front three.\n\nWithout a forward on the bench, Klopp lacked options and with Everton two goals clear and fewer than 10 minutes to go, all he had to turn to was Kostas Tsimikas and Joe Gomez. Both good players, but when an attacker was needed there was nothing the manager could do.\n\nIt has been a gruelling season for Liverpool amid their attempts to win four competitions and the emotional uncertainty provided by Klopp's summer exit.\n\nThe Everton fans sang: \"You lost the league at Goodison Park\" but the weariness has been growing and is hard to counteract. There will be no shame if Liverpool do not take their title challenge to the final days. Nine months of exertions take their toll.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_unwin@theguardian.com", "name": "Will Unwin",

The skipper's decision to mention the issue in light of such a poor defeat did not go down well with Sky Sports pundit Wayne Rooney.\n\nREAD HERE: Noel King On Dundalk Appointment: 'It Was 100 Per Cent Unexpected'\n\nREAD HERE: Erik Ten Hag Calls Out 'Embarrassing' Media Reaction To Coventry City FA Cup Result\n\nVirgil van Dijk admitted that Liverpool had been subpar at Goodison Park on Wednesday, and stated that they were on the verge of slipping out of the title races if such performances continued.\n\nThe Dutch centre-back then went on to subtly reference the issue of Liverpool repeatedly being scheduled to play in the 12:30pm Saturday kick-off slot, with their weekend fixture against West Ham again falling at that time:\n\nIf we play like we did overall in the game like today, not winning challenges and giving the ref opportunities to give free kicks like he did many times, then we have no chance to win the title.\n\nIt's a tough one, obviously we have to do much better against a side that's playing against relegation.\n\nIt's time to focus on the 12:30 kick-off again.\n\nIt is an issue which has been raised throughout the season by Liverpool fans, with the team repeatedly scheduled to play in the spot immediately after players returned from international breaks. Jurgen Klopp has been vocal on the topic and earlier this season slammed a reporter for questioning why he had such an issue with the repeated 12:30 kick-offs.\n\nNonetheless, Wayne Rooney was unimpressed with Virgil van Dijk's choice to bring the matter up in his post-match interview.\n\nThe Manchester United legend was a guest pundit at Goodison Park on Wednesday night alongside Daniel Sturridge and Jamie Carragher. The former Everton striker could not understand why van Dijk chose to slip in a mention of the 12:30 kick-offs in his post-match interview and questioned what it meant about Liverpool's mentality:\n\nI think a worrying thing there is - and it's happened a lot throughout the season - as Daniel [Sturridge] said, he's the captain and he's talking about Liverpool being outfought.\n\nBut, again, we're hearing about 12:30 kick-offs after he's just lost a derby. He should and that Liverpool team should be wanting to be on the pitch tomorrow morning to get the next game going.\n\nWhen you lose a game, especially a derby game, you want the next game to come quick. We've heard it so many times about Liverpool this season with 12:30 kick-offs. Get on with it! That's part of your job, get on with it and you should be ready to play.\n\nThe frequency of early kick-off slots received by Liverpool both this season and last has undoubtedly been unusually high, especially at periods of the season when teams would have preferred to avoid it.\n\nNonetheless, it is hard to argue with Rooney's assessment of van Dijk's post-match interview and inquisition as to why he chose to mention the matter in the heat of the moment, minutes after a crushing derby defeat.\n\nThe loss to old rivals Everton could spell the end of Liverpool's title challenge, with Arsenal three points ahead of the Reds, and Manchester City a point behind with two games in hand.\n\nLiverpool return to action on Saturday at (you guessed it) 12:30pm, away to David Moyes' West Ham. Anything other than a win will unequivocally end their hopes of claiming a 20th league title this season.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eoin_harrington@balls.ie", "name": "Eoin Harrington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sturridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Sturridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coventry City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dundalk F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNFxcXC8yNTA5NTc1MFxcXC9XYXluZS1yb29uZXktdmFuLURpamstTGl2ZXJwb29sLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJiZDgyODY3Y2MxNWMzYzNhNGQ1MDNhZmE1MDA3Y2FjMzk2Zjg5ZGZkIn0=/waynerooneyslatesvandijkcommentsafterliverpoolderbydefeatballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

after ruining Liverpool's title pursuit", "body": "Liverpool's Premier League title bid was left in tatters after being bullied and beaten by a better side as Everton won a Merseyside derby at Goodison Park for the first time in almost 14 years.\n\nIn doing so Sean Dyche's side, 2-0 victors courtesy of goals in either half from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, virtually assured their own top-flight future after moving eight points clear of 18th-placed Luton with four matches to go.\n\nJurgen Klopp's much-celebrated 'last dance' is turning into an undignified stagger towards the exit as his first defeat across Stanley Park after two wins and five draws previously came less than a week after they were knocked out of the Europa League by Atalanta.\n\nThe club have moved on his successor - Feyenoord's Arne Slot - by opening negotiations with the Eredivisie club but this would not have made for a happy watch from his Netherlands home.\n\nIn March 2019 Everton fans laid claim to ruining Liverpool's title chances after a goalless draw here as Klopp's side finished second to City by a point.\n\nThey will take even greater delight in ruining Klopp's farewell.\n\nA third successive home league win for the first time since September 2021 means Everton can breathe easier at the other end of the table and bask in the warmth of a derby well won - only their second in the last 30 encounters in total.\n\nThey set about dominating the visitors physically and centre-back Ibrahima Konate, in particular, struggled against Calvert-Lewin, who was only passed fit a couple of hours before kick-off.\n\nThe hosts' positive approach seemed to have paid off after just six minutes when Calvert-Lewin was brought down by Alisson Becker after nicking Jack Harrison's outside-of-the-boot pass past him but the penalty was rescinded after VAR ruled the striker was offside.\n\nBen Godfrey, who headed wide a Dwight McNeil free-kick, slid in to divert behind Mohamed Salah's goalbound angled shot from Trent Alexander-Arnold's delightfully-chipped pass into the penalty area with Curtis Jones and Nunez waiting to turn it in.\n\nHaving people in the right place at the right time was a theme of the first half as Jordan Pickford saved from Nunez, Luis Diaz and Andy Robertson - although the first two made his job easier by shooting straight at him.\n\nThe goal Everton deserved came in the 27th minute when Branthwaite forced the ball under Alisson and in off the post after Liverpool made a mess of clearing a free-kick with Konate getting in the way of Mac Allister.\n\nAnother poor performance from Salah saw him scuff a shot into Branthwaite, sparing him the embarrassment of seeing it sail wide, but then slashed the rebound into the Gwladys Street.\n\nIn keeping with the emerging pattern over recent weeks Liverpool faded after the break after Virgil van Dijk headed straight at Pickford and when McNeil's long-range shot was tipped over, Calvert-Lewin rose unchallenged at the far post to nod home the resulting corner.\n\nDyche and his team had done a brilliant job of exposing Liverpool's weakness as that was the sixth successive time Klopp's side had failed to win the first ball at a set-piece.\n\nBranthwaite could have added further embarrassment but headed wide while the closest Liverpool came to a response was when Diaz's curling shot rebounded off the post and they played out the final minutes with 'you lost the league at Goodison Park' ringing around the ground.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com",

The Reds sit second in the Premier League, three points adrift of league leaders Arsenal.\n\nThe Gunners put five past Chelsea on Tuesday night and has a considerably better goal difference than Liverpool and third-place Manchester City, who does have games in hand.\n\nLiverpool won the reverse fixture against Everton 2-0 back in October and J\u00fcrgen Klopp does have an excellent record in derby matches. He has lost just once in 18 games, with that coming behind-closed-doors at Anfield in 2021.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool team vs Everton predicted as Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 in and Harvey Elliott drops out\n\nREAD MORE: Virgil van Dijk has already raved about assistant Arne Slot could bring with him to Liverpool\n\nRemarkably that is just one of four Everton league successes over Liverpool since the turn of the century, with the Reds so often having the upper hand over their city rivals. Former world champion boxer and boyhood Everton fan Tony Bellew previously reflected on that record and one match in particular that stood out.\n\nLiverpool had fallen behind to an early Kevin Campbell goal at Goodison Park in September 2001 but roared back thanks to a stunning strike from Steven Gerrard. The visitors went in front as Michael Owen scored from the spot before John Arne Riise secured the win.\n\nBellew though still recalls being irate at Gerrard's celebration after equalizing. Speaking to BBC Sport's Match of the Day from inside Goodison Park, he said: \"I sat here for the derby, the horrible derby when that horrible man Steven Gerrard scored.\n\n\"He ran right down this way with his tongue out, 'Blaaa!' If I get hold of you, I'll pull that tongue out of our mouth. Just kills me that he is probably the best player this city's ever produced. Well it is him or Wayne Rooney -- he's unbelievable.\"\n\nGerrard had an excellent record in Merseyside derby matches, scoring 10 times against Everton. His tally includes a memorable hat-trick in an Anfield victory back in 2012.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Arne_Riise", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Arne Riise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahima_Konat\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibrahima Konat\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Campbell_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Campbell (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/liverpool_com_951/1483e7245d200aa685d7af97f6256920", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-", "textStart": 1213, "textEnd": 1227}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

What a talent he is.\n\nLB: Vitaliy Mykolenko - 6/10 - Played well until being forced off with injury at half-time.\n\nRM: Jack Harrison - 6/10 - Faded a little as the game went on but as a constant menace as well as working hard on the defensive side of things.\n\nCM: James Garner - 7/10 - Helped swarm Liverpool's midfielders and kept it simple with the ball.\n\nCM: Idrissa Gana Gueye 7/10 - A major part of Everton's control of the centre of the park. Ran himself into the ground and\n\nLM: Dwight McNeil - 7/10 - Always there to help out defensively or get Everton up the pitch and his set-piece deliveries were brilliant.\n\nAM: Abdoulaye Doucoure - 6/10 - Not always neat and tidy in possession but was always an outlet and got close to Calvert-Lewin to make the most of his flick-ons.\n\nST: Dominic Calvert-Lewin - 8/10 - Made something of every ball lofted up towards him, giving Liverpool's centre-backs hell in the process. Deserved his goal.\n\nSubs not used: Virginia, Keane, Gomes, Warrington, Danjuma, Hunt.\n\nSean Dyche - 8/10 - Got his tactical plan spot on, setting Everton up to dominate their neighbours in a manner rarely seen in the last decade.\n\nGK: Alisson Becker - 5/10 - Set the tone for the night in clumsily giving a penalty away before the let-off of a VAR offside call. Takes no blame for the goals, though.\n\nRB: Trent Alexander-Arnold - 6/10 - Liverpool's best creator during his time on the pitch but frequently let down by those around him.\n\nCB: Ibrahima Konate - 3/10 - Completely bullied by Calvert-Lewin and poor in possession along with it. Deserved to be hooked just past the hour mark.\n\nCB: Virgil van Dijk - 5/10 - Not quite as ineffective as Konate but it's rare you see a defence he is part of dominated in this way.\n\nLB: Andy Robertson - 5/10 - Got into so many promising positions going forward but was found wanting in terms of quality in key moments.\n\nCM: Alexis Mac Allister 5/10 - One of Liverpool's better midfielders, which isn't saying much. A shadow of the player seen earlier in the season.\n\nCM: Dominik Szoboszlai - 4/10 - Wasteful with the ball and physically meek off it. The Hungarian's form has gone off a cliff since his mid-season injury.\n\nCM: Curtis Jones - 5/10 - Another one who seems to be suffering a hangover from a recent injury. Could not wrestle control of the game back from Everton.\n\nRW: Mohamed Salah - 3/10 - Just hasn't been himself since that injury at the Africa Cup of Nations, as he showed in missing several chances here. Liverpool may have an interesting decision to make on his future this summer.\n\nST: Darwin Nunez - 2/10 - Has never shaken off that knack for missing big opportunities and did it again here. Rarely troubled Everton's centre-backs, either. A puzzle for the new manager to solve.\n\nLW: Luis Diaz - 5/10 - Did about as well as any Liverpool attacker but that only amounted to missing a one-on-one and hitting the post.\n\nJurgen Klopp - 4/10 - Appears to be working with a hugely fatigued squad but his lack of answers for this recent stumble has been surprising.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"},

We create, we don't use them often enough.\n\n\"To the end of the season it's obviously not great because the first thing you need is results, for that you need to score goals, shouldn't concede, would be helpful as well. Yeah, nothing good to say about this today.\"\n\nOne huge chance in particular fell to Darwin Nunez, who had a clear shot at goal, but he could only fire his effort straight at Jordan Pickford when he should arguably have found the bottom corner.\n\nThe Uruguayan is Liverpool's second top scorer all season on 18 goals but club legend Jamie Carragher doesn't think he can produce when it matters.\n\nSpeaking on the missed chance, he told Sky Sports: \"The chance Nunez misses before half-time, that's unforgivable at this level.\n\n\"These lads [Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge] know a lot more than me about that, but that's not acceptable at this level, certainly when Liverpool are going for the title.\"\n\nCarragher later said there is a 'real discussion' with Liverpool's new manager, who could be Arne Slot amid opened talks, about the future of Mohamed Salah amid his contract expiry next summer.\n\nHowever, he doesn't think this is the same when it comes to Nunez: \"I think I'm at the stage now with Nunez where I don't think there is a question to ask.\n\n\"I think after two years at the club, and I've probably been guilty of this, you want him to do well so much, there's so much of what you like because he gives everything.\n\n\"He runs, he causes trouble, he gets the odd goal, he gets an assist but after two years now and when Liverpool this season are going for the title, in those big games you need your man to score.\n\n\"Away at Old Trafford, away at Goodison, in the European game at Atalanta. There's no time to wait, this is not October, November, this is the business end of the title race.\"\n\nPremier League title glory was all that was left for Liverpool following exits in the FA Cup and Europa League, but this now looks a distant possibility.\n\nOnly three points separates them and Arsenal but with the Gunners looking strong and Manchester City still able to take top spot, it could be out of reach for the Reds.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_calcutt@talksport.com", "name": "Robert Calcutt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Sturridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Sturridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/DF-TALKSPORT-KLOPP_bf1926.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Neville Southall has made the most Merseyside derby appearances and kept a clean sheet in his final derby in October 1997, which Everton won 2-0. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Merseyside derby is contested between Liverpool and Everton and the rivalry between the two teams has earned its status as one of the fiercest in English football. Despite the fact the fixture has seen more red cards than any other in Premier League history, it is affectionately referred to as 'the friendly derby' due to the tradition of fans attending derbies together while supporting opposing sides.\n\nThe two teams first met all the way back in 1894, with the Toffees emerging as 3-0 winners. Since then, there have been 242 more games played between the two and the Reds have won the lion's share with 99.\n\nTheir meetings are always hugely competitive affairs and players can earn a place in their club's folklore with the winner in the derby. There are many players on either side who have left a notable impression on the derby's history and here are all 11 players who have appeared in 30 or more Merseyside derbies.\n\nPlayers with the most Merseyside derby appearances\n\nRank\n\nPlayer\n\nTeam\n\nNo. of appearances\n\nYears\n\n1\n\nNeville Southall\n\nEverton\n\n41\n\n1982-1997\n\n2\n\nIan Rush\n\nLiverpool\n\n36\n\n1981-1996\n\n3\n\nBruce Grobbelaar\n\nLiverpool\n\n34\n\n1981-1993\n\n4\n\nAlan Hansen\n\nLiverpool\n\n33\n\n1977-1990\n\n5\n\nSteven Gerrard\n\nLiverpool\n\n33\n\n1999-2015\n\n6\n\nKevin Ratcliffe\n\nEverton\n\n32\n\n1981-1991\n\n7\n\nIan Callaghan\n\nLiverpool\n\n31\n\n1962-1977\n\n8\n\nRonnie Whelan\n\nLiverpool\n\n31\n\n1981-1994\n\n9\n\nGraeme Sharp\n\nEverton\n\n30\n\n1982-1991\n\n10\n\nDave Watson\n\nEverton\n\n30\n\n1987-1999\n\n11\n\nJamie Carragher\n\nLiverpool\n\n30\n\n1998-2013\n\nRelated 10 Best Matches in Merseyside Derby History (Ranked) We have ranked the most entertaining and intense Merseyside derbies between Liverpool and Everton of all time. 11 Jamie Carragher 30 appearances for Liverpool\n\nGiven his career-long devotion to Liverpool, a 17-year association that saw him make 737 appearances for the Reds, it's quite hard to believe that Jamie Carragher was a die-hard Evertonian in his youth. However, the centre-back admitted that it didn't take long for his allegiances to switch, claiming that as early as 1999, he was hoping the Toffees would get beat.\n\nCarragher made his senior debut for Liverpool in early 1997 and appeared in his first Merseyside derby the following year, keeping a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park in October 1998. He would go on to play in exactly 30 derbies during his career, helping his side win more than half of those matches, and his final derby ended in the same scoreline as his first, this time at Anfield in May 2013.\n\nJamie Carragher\n\nClub\n\nLiverpool\n\nDerbies played\n\n30\n\nGoals scored\n\n0\n\nFirst derby\n\n0-0 draw, 17th October 1998\n\nLast derby\n\n0-0 draw, 5th May 2013\n\nWins\n\n16\n\nDraws\n\n9\n\nLosses\n\n5\n\nWin percentage\n\n53.3%\n\n10 Dave Watson 30 appearances for Everton\n\nWhile Jamie Carragher was a supporter of the blue half of Merseyside in his childhood, Everton legend Dave Watson actually began his footballing career with Liverpool. However, the centre-back didn't make a single senior appearance for the Reds before he was sold to Norwich City at the age of 19, and he later arrived at Goodison Park in 1986.\n\nWatson spent the next 15 years of his career with the Toffees, making over 450 appearances for the club, which included 30 Merseyside derbies. The defender started in a 3-1 defeat for his side at Anfield in April 1987 to mark his first derby appearance and his final start against the Reds came 12 years later, when the 37-year-old captained the Toffees in a 3-2 loss.\n\nDave Watson\n\nClub\n\nEverton\n\nDerbies played\n\n30\n\nGoals scored\n\n2\n\nFirst derby\n\n1-3 loss, 25th April 1987\n\nLast derby\n\n2-3 loss, 3rd April 1999\n\nWins\n\n7\n\nDraws\n\n11\n\nLosses\n\n12\n\nWin percentage\n\n23.3%\n\n9 Graeme Sharp 30 appearances for Everton\n\nGraeme Sharp is the second-highest goalscorer in Everton's history, with 160 goals to his name in 426 appearances. In 11 years at Goodison Park, the Scotsman managed to appear in 30 Merseyside derbies and scored seven goals against the club's arch rivals, including a memorable winner at Anfield in October 1984 which won the BBC Goal of the Season award.\n\nHaving signed for the Toffees as a 19-year-old in 1980, Sharp had to wait two years to appear in his first derby, and scored the consolation goal in a 3-1 defeat at Goodison Park.

The Irishman also played in his fair share of Merseyside derbies and boasts the highest win percentage out of any other player on this list.\n\nWhelan made the trip over from Dublin to Liverpool in 1979, but didn't play in his first Merseyside derby until November 1981, when he helped his side to a 3-1 victory. He captained Liverpool in the 1989 FA Cup final, in which they beat their Merseyside rivals 3-2, and played against Everton for the final time in March 1994, as goals from Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler took his win tally up to 18.\n\nRonnie Whelan\n\nClub\n\nLiverpool\n\nDerbies played\n\n31\n\nGoals scored\n\n1\n\nFirst derby\n\n3-1 win, 7th November 1981\n\nLast derby\n\n2-1 win, 13th March 1994\n\nWins\n\n18\n\nDraws\n\n7\n\nLosses\n\n6\n\nWin percentage\n\n58.1%\n\n7 Ian Callaghan 31 appearances for Liverpool\n\nIan Callaghan's record of 857 appearances for Liverpool is higher than any other player, so it's no surprise that his name is also on the list for most Merseyside derby appearances, despite him starting his Anfield career when the Reds were still in the second tier of English football. Therefore, he had to wait two years to make his first derby appearance in 1962, which was the first league fixture between the two sides for over 11 years and ended in a 2-2 draw at Goodison Park.\n\nOver the next 16 years, Callaghan would play a key role in Liverpool becoming one of the most feared clubs in English and European football, and he would appear in a further 30 derbies, weighing in with two goals in the fixture. His final derby appearance came in October 1977 and ended in a goalless draw at Anfield.\n\nIan Callaghan\n\nClub\n\nLiverpool\n\nDerbies played\n\n31\n\nGoals scored\n\n2\n\nFirst derby\n\n2-2 draw, 22nd September 1962\n\nLast derby\n\n0-0 draw, 22nd October 1977\n\nWins\n\n12\n\nDraws\n\n11\n\nLosses\n\n8\n\nWin percentage\n\n38.7%\n\n6 Kevin Ratcliffe 32 appearances for Everton\n\nKevin Ratcliffe is one of the most distinguished names in Everton's history, having captained the side during their most successful period in the mid-1980s. The Welshman is also the club's second-highest appearance-maker in the Merseyside derby, having played against Liverpool 32 times during his 12-year stint at Goodison Park.\n\nThe defender's first derby appearance came in January 1981 as he helped the Toffees record a famous 2-1 win over Bob Paisley's side to knock them out of the FA Cup in the fourth round. Ratcliffe also notably scored one of only two goals in his Everton career with a long-range effort at Anfield in February 1986, which somehow squirmed under Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar.\n\nKevin Ratcliffe\n\nClub\n\nEverton\n\nDerbies played\n\n32\n\nGoals scored\n\n1\n\nFirst derby\n\n2-1 win, 24th January 1981\n\nLast derby\n\n1-3 defeat, 31st August 1991\n\nWins\n\n7\n\nDraws\n\n9\n\nLosses\n\n16\n\nWin percentage\n\n21.9%\n\n5 Steven Gerrard 33 appearances for Liverpool Close\n\nSteven Gerrard epitomised Liverpool Football Club throughout his 17 years representing his boyhood club. As an avid Red himself, he knew precisely what the Merseyside derby meant to supporters and gave his all every time he featured against the Toffees, weighing in with an impressive 10 goals in 33 derbies.\n\nGerrard made his first derby appearance as a substitute in Liverpool's 3-2 win over Everton in April 1999 and scored his first goal in the fixture in a 3-1 win at Goodison Park in September 2001. The midfielder memorably scored all three goals when the Reds thrashed the Blues 3-0 in March 2012, but he also holds the unwanted record of being one of only two players to receive multiple red cards in a Merseyside derby, alongside Phil Neville.\n\nSteven Gerrard\n\nClub\n\nLiverpool\n\nDerbies played\n\n33\n\nGoals scored\n\n10\n\nFirst derby\n\n3-2 win, 3rd April 1999\n\nLast derby\n\n0-0 draw, 7th February 2015\n\nWins\n\n17\n\nDraws\n\n11\n\nLosses\n\n5\n\nWin percentage\n\n51.5%\n\nRelated Every Red Card Given in Merseyside Derby History The Merseyside Derby between Liverpool and Everton is famous for its red cards, we look at every single one given in the Premier League era. 4 Alan Hansen 33 appearances for Liverpool\n\nAlan Hansen was a key component of the hugely successful Liverpool team in the late 70s and the 80s and is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders in English football history. He signed for the Reds from Partick Thistle in 1977 and made his first Merseyside derby appearance later that year, helping his new club keep a clean sheet in a goalless draw at Anfield.\n\nThe Scotsman played in 33 derbies throughout his Liverpool career and is most infamously remembered by Everton supporters for deliberately handling on the line to prevent Everton forward Adrian Heath from scoring in the 1984 League Cup final, which ended in a 0-0 draw and saw Liverpool triumph in the replay.

The Zimbabwean international arrived at Anfield in 1981 and was the first-choice goalkeeper for the Reds for over 10 years, helping them win numerous honours and appearing in 34 Merseyside derbies.\n\nGrobbelaar made his first appearance against Everton in a 3-1 victory for Liverpool in November 1981. He suffered the indignity of conceding an own goal in the 1984 Charity Shield, which Everton won 1-0, and his final Merseyside derby appearance is remembered for an infamous coming together between himself and teammate Steve McManaman after the Toffees opened the scoring in a 2-0 win at Goodison Park.\n\nBruce Grobbelaar\n\nClub\n\nLiverpool\n\nDerbies played\n\n34\n\nClean sheets\n\n13\n\nFirst derby\n\n3-1 win, 7th October 1981\n\nLast derby\n\n0-2 defeat, 18th September 1993\n\nWins\n\n17\n\nDraws\n\n9\n\nLosses\n\n8\n\nWin percentage\n\n50%\n\n2 Ian Rush 36 appearances for Liverpool\n\nNot only did Ian Rush make more Merseyside derby appearances than any other Liverpool player, he also scored by far the most goals in the fixture's history, edging out second-placed Dixie Dean by six goals. The Welshman marked his first derby in October 1981 with the clinching goal in a 3-1 home victory for the Reds.\n\nThe following year, Rush netted four goals in Liverpool's 5-0 win at Goodison Park, becoming the first player since the Second World War to achieve such a feat in the fixture, and he also bagged a brace in both FA Cup finals between the two clubs in 1986 and 1989, which were each won by the Reds.

After signing for Everton in 1981, he made his derby debut later the following year, but was unable to prevent the Reds firing three past him in a 3-1 defeat at Goodison Park.\n\nSouthall, who also holds Everton's appearance record with 751, managed to keep 15 clean sheets against the Reds during his Everton career, which was no mean feat given the goalscoring prowess of his international teammate Ian Rush during that period.

The issues are glaring and the room for improvement is sizeable.\n\nIn the space of a grim six weeks Klopp has gone from potentially signing off with an unprecedented quadruple to his farewell tour quickly unravelling. It started with a self-inflicted defeat to Manchester United in the FA Cup. Then came the error-strewn Europa League exit at the hands of Atalanta.\n\nNow their title challenge lies in ruins after taking just four points out of the last 12 on offer against Crystal Palace, Fulham and now Everton. This was not how it was supposed to end.\n\nThe TV documentary makers, who have been filming behind the scenes at Liverpool since December, thought they would be capturing a valuable, victorious and historic goodbye. However, the 'Last Dance' as some players and staff have called it -- a reference to the hit Netflix series about Michael Jordan's final season with the Chicago Bulls -- has involved far too many missteps.\n\nAt Goodison Park on Wednesday night they fell flat on their faces. The Merseyside derby has given Klopp so many memories to cherish during his reign. He once had to shell out \u00a38,000 to the Football Association for deciding to celebrate a dramatic late winner from Divock Origi by manically running into the centre circle to embrace Alisson.\n\nKlopp had lost just one of his first 18 meetings with Everton, and no fans were there to see it as it took place behind closed doors at Anfield during the pandemic. But his last taste of this fixture provided one of the most gut-wrenching lows of his tenure.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" crowed the jubilant home crowd as Everton celebrated their first home win over Liverpool since October 2010.\n\nBack then a beleaguered Roy Hodgson fielded a line up including Paul Konchesky, Sotirios Kyrgiakos and Joe Cole. The failings were grimly predictable with the club in chaos.\n\nThis was very different. This was Liverpool in title contention in the final month of the campaign and seeking to crank up the pressure on Arsenal and Manchester City after Sunday's morale-boosting win at Craven Cottage. What they produced against relegation-threatened opposition was pitiful. The array of empty seats in the away end when the final whistle sounded was both stark and understandable.\n\n\"I think everyone has to ask if they really gave everything and do they really want to win the league?\" said captain Virgil van Dijk, who bemoaned them \"not winning challenges\" and wasting chances \"we should have scored from\".\n\nRather than unleashing a flurry of fist pumps, there was an apology from a downbeat Klopp to the supporters for the paucity of what had been served up. So vulnerable at one end, so toothless at the other.\n\nThere was an alarming naivety to Liverpool as they conceded a succession of cheap free-kicks and allowed themselves to be bullied as Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin both punished dreadful defending from set-pieces.\n\nTheir firepower has enabled Klopp's side to dig themselves out of numerous holes when they have fallen behind this season but that ability has waned with Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah hopelessly out of form.\n\nIf, as expected, Slot takes over, he has some big decisions to make alongside new sporting director Richard Hughes.\n\nIs Nunez really the No 9 capable of taking Liverpool where they want to be? The Uruguayan's return of 18 goals and 13 assists in all competitions this season is on the face of it respectable.\n\nBut when the stakes have been raised he's failed to deliver at the business end of the season - firing blanks in eight of his last nine appearances. Nunez turns 25 in June, he isn't a kid but the rough edges and erratic displays remain there for all to see. So many chances have been snatched at and squandered by him.\n\nNunez was so ineffective against Everton that Klopp's reluctance to replace him with young striker Jayden Danns in the second half was baffling.\n\nAnd what about Salah, who will enter the final year of his contract this summer? At Christmas, offering him an extension looked like a no-brainer given his prolific return.\n\nBut since suffering a hamstring injury at the Africa Cup of Nations and then breaking down again shortly after making his comeback for Liverpool, he has been nowhere near his usual levels. The Egyptian, who turns 32 in June, has only scored twice in his last seven outings - both penalties. Like Nunez, he looks bereft of confidence and was wasteful against Everton.\n\nThe tireless Luis Diaz was the only Liverpool attacker to carry any kind of sustained threat as the absence of Diogo Jota due to a hip problem and the late withdrawal of Cody Gakpo after his partner went into labour was keenly felt.\n\nLiverpool's frontline clearly needs reinforcing this summer. The same is true of the midfield and defence with Joel Matip and Thiago expected to depart when their contracts expire. We're talking about three or four high quality additions rather than sweeping changes.\n\nIt looks like Slot will be entrusted with trying to revive the fortunes of Dominic Szoboszlai, who lit up the Premier League in the first half of the season but has lost his way since. Centre-back Ibrahima Konate is another concern given his recent downturn in form and the amount of football he misses. Jarell Quansah should certainly have started ahead of him at Goodison.\n\nYou can blame injuries or players returning to action lacking rhythm for what's transpired during the run-in as Liverpool resemble such a fading force. You can also point a finger at mental and physical fatigue given the absence of energy and dynamism.\n\nMaybe the pressure and the emotion of Klopp's farewell has played a part too. The manager has repeatedly referenced the damage done to the mood by the two visits to Old Trafford in quick succession when his side came away feeling short-changed. He hasn't been able to come up with the solutions to problems at both ends of the field.\n\nWhat you can't blame is Klopp's decision to go public with his decision to step down in late January. For a start, Liverpool won nine of their next 10 matches. And keeping it secret simply wasn't an option as Liverpool embarked on an extensive search for his successor. For one thing, Klopp's staff needed to know where they stood in terms of the future.\n\nRewind to last August and after such a turbulent summer, most Liverpool supporters would have gleefully accepted a season a trophy and a top-four finish. But expectation levels rocketed after a flying start and once Klopp made his intentions clear, landing the big prize became an energy-sapping obsession.\n\nThree weeks ago Liverpool beat Sheffield United 3-1 to move two points clear of their rivals with eight games to go. They were masters of their own destiny. It feels like a lifetime ago given how momentum has been squandered since.\n\nWhatever happens, Klopp's Anfield legacy is secure. He's been the most transformative figure in the club's history since Bill Shankly. He's still guaranteed the warmest of send-offs next month, but his remarkable era seems destined to have a decidedly underwhelming finale.\n\nSlot has made it clear he wants the job as Liverpool seek to agree a compensation package with Feyenoord. His attacking style, a track record of developing young talent and punchy personality are all deemed to fit the bill.\n\nThere are big boots to fill but the final stages of Klopp's reign has also exposed some glaring frailties as one era ends and another one begins.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin sealed victory for the Blues on that occasion.\n\nPrior to that, Everton had not beaten the Reds in three years, failing to win on five different occasions in all competitions.\n\nBefore the win in 2024, Everton last tasted success in a 2-0 win at Anfield on February 20, 2021 in the Premier League, in a game overseen by manager Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nStrikes from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson ended Liverpool's long-running winning streak over the Toffees.\n\nIt also marked the first time Liverpool lost four top-flight home games in a row since 1923.\n\nThe win ended more than a decade of Everton failing to defeat their Merseyside rivals, their previous win coming on October 17, 2010 at Goodison Park in the Premier League.\n\nEverton won their first game over Liverpool in 24 meetings in all competitions - drawing 12 times and losing 11 games - and put an end to what was Liverpool's longest unbeaten run against a single team.\n\nIn 2010, Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta both netted in the 2-0 win, overseen by then-manager David Moyes.\n\nFor more context, Roy Hodgson was a few months into his disastrous reign as Liverpool manager, with the defeat placing the Reds at 19th in the table following the full-time whistle.\n\nIt led the Liverpool manager to admit that the Reds were facing a relegation battle, despite it only being October.\n\n\"There is lots of speculation and negative things being said but we understand that,\" said Hodgson at the time.\n\n\"Most of the players and myself are more accustomed to pats on the back than kicks in the teeth but we also know that in football kicks in the teeth are part of the game. What you do is try to keep as many teeth as you can and try to get on with it.\"\n\nThe likes of Steven Gerrard, Fernando Torres and Jamie Carragher all started, along with Pepe Reina, Paul Konchesky, Lucas Leiva and Martin Skrtel.\n\nFenway Sports Group had just begun their reign as owners of the club, though the Blues ensured they were to have the most disastrous of welcomes.\n\nTorres, who already had his head turned with his desire to leave the club, was shut out for most of the derby, and captain Gerrard was unable to spark any inspiration.\n\nSince that derby win in October 2010, Everton fell to 11 defeats and 12 draws in all competitions against their Merseyside rivals.\n\nIn that same period, the Toffees went through six permanent managers - Moyes, Roberto Martinez, Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce, Marco Silva and Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nTheir heaviest defeats came twice in two 4-0 losses, in January 2014 and then again in April 2016, while they suffered a 5-2 defeat at Anfield in December 2019.\n\nLiverpool have won two December Merseyside derbies in stoppage time. Sadio Mane scored in the 90th minute in December 2016 to edge out a 1-0 win at Goodison Park, and Divock Origi netted a memorable winning goal in the 96th minute at Anfield in December 2018.",

Stuart Atwell has been heavily scrutinised this week for his role in the Toffees' controversial win over Nottingham Forest at Goodison Park.\n\nThe 41-year-old, who was born in Nuneaton - a town in Warwickshire - was appointed lead Video Assistant Referee for the clash, with Simon Long named as his assistant. During the game, Anthony Taylor, the on-field referee, dismissed appeals for a penalty in favour of the Midlands-based outfit on three separate occasions.\n\nWhile the 45-year-old may not have been convinced by what he had seen in real-time, Atwell adjudged his colleague to have made the correct decision after several reviews at Stockley Park. Furious that VAR overlooked several incidents, Nottingham Forest published an eye-opening statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, warning that their 'patience has been tested'.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool might have to shake hands with the enemy until perfect new manager is available\n\nREAD MORE: Marco van Basten names perfect Jurgen Klopp heir as next Liverpool manager prediction made\n\nAs a result of Everton's win at the weekend, Nuno Espirito Santo's side have been plunged deeper into a relegation battle.

I don't want to use that as an excuse, really, as long as the boys are fit, not injured, that helps.\n\n'Let me say, Gabriel and [William] Saliba played all the games for Arsenal. Did they play a little bit less than us? I don't even know 100 per cent but they played a lot of games as well.\n\n'Coming back from injury obviously is then slightly different, because of the intensity, the game is not waiting for you. Up front it is a super-intense job to do, always high sprint, always go, go, go and that we cannot change [players] there is difficult.\n\n'I know we had Dannsy [Jayden Danns] on the bench, but we didn't know we had to bring him in [to the squad] because of the two situations - with Diogo [Jota] we only learned two days ago [about his injury] and with Cody [Gakpo] actually today really.\n\n'So, that's now not a game for an 18-year-old boy and [James] Tarkowski and [Jarrad] Branthwaite kill you in these situations and it doesn't help. So, a lot of things came together [and] it's not great timing, I admit that.\n\n'I would prefer to be sitting here, winning 4-0, flying and can't wait for the next game. How I said, the job is to win football games and the more you win, the more successful you are. In the moment, we didn't win enough to get anything out of the season yet so we should better start winning again.'\n\nKlopp also believes Liverpool need a 'crisis' at both Arsenal and City in order to finish the season as Premier League champions.\n\n'I understand it, it's part of the business, but I don't know why I have to answer this question - obviously you can read the table,' Klopp said.\n\n'So, should I say now we are still fully in? We need a crisis at [Manchester] City and Arsenal, and need to win football games, because if they start now losing all the games and we do what we did tonight, nothing changed. And we are not safe in the Champions League as well so we should just play better football.\n\n'You can see we are in a rush in front of the goal, you can see that. It's long ago but I blame a little bit the [Manchester] United game for it; that many chances and you play really good but you don't get anything for it. That's really bad.\n\n'Since then, we create but we don't score often enough and that doesn't help. It's not like in a situation like that you don't score and then just [think], 'Ah, forget it, who cares?' You cannot act like you scored 15 goals in the last two games or whatever. You can see that and that's a problem.\n\n'It's always like this - you have to fight through these periods, it was never different. People asked me already about mentality. The mentality has different aspects. It's not a problem of attitude. The boys want; nobody is doing anything like that on purpose.\n\n'It's my job to bring them into a situation that they feel confident to do it. With that part, I'm responsible for everything that happened tonight, so it's not that I feel great. But that's the most tricky part of football obviously, and in the moment it didn't work out and now we have to keep trying.'\n\nMORE : Sheffield United boss slams referee over Manchester United penalty and free-kick in 4-2 defeat\n\nMORE : Wayne Rooney takes aim at Liverpool star over post-match comments after Everton defeat", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_davie@metro.co.uk", "name": "Chris Davie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Tarkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Danns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neil Danns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEI_201276187-cfb1-e1714026236250.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1616px%2C849px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Listen on Spotify, Apple or anywhere you get your podcasts\n\nIt was sung with a hint of trepidation at first but soon spread around this grand old stadium like a virus. 'You lost the league at Goodison Park,' was the chant, ramping up in volume and speed as the clock ticked towards 90 minutes.\n\nAfter countless occasions of last-minute goals for the red half of Merseyside in this fixture, Everton fans feared jinxing it by jumping the gun and singing too early. But as the minutes went by, an unexpected but richly deserved outcome came to fruition.\n\nLiverpool players collapsed to the turf at full-time looking like they had just ran a marathon. The Premier League title race is a marathon not a sprint and, although the Reds started fast and kept the pace for longer than most expected, they have slowed to a walk in the final miles.\n\nOf course, it is not over until it is over. But the form of Manchester City and Arsenal means a fairytale ending for Jurgen Klopp now requires a miracle more special than the long list of heroics which have come before for the German boss, who says he needs a 'crisis' elsewhere.\n\nSpeaking of Arsenal, the last Evertonian to score in a Merseyside Derby win at Goodison Park was Gunners boss Mikel Arteta way back in 2010. 'Well not any more,' laughed Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Play on Apple Spotify\n\nMore on Everton later - they deserve rich plaudits for this victory. But first, a Liverpool inquest: is this defeat, their second in three league matches, a huge surprise? All season, they have started games poorly by going 1-0 down in 15 league matches.\n\nSooner or later, it was going to catch up with them. So too was an injury crisis that has plagued the squad all year, with Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo particularly missed at Goodison Park. But this was still a multi-million pound squad who looked bereft of ideas and low on belief.\n\nIt would be wrong to question the mentality when it is something they have been praised for all season. But the Mentality Monsters have looked like Mentality Minnows in the last month. With a Premier League title well achievable, they have blown it and only have themselves to blame.\n\n'Games like these, the bare minimum is fight,' said Virgil van Dijk. 'We were lacking that at so many moments.' He added: 'You can't accept the way we let our season end, if you play like we did today, you don't deserve to win the league.'\n\nThe most obvious problem is the lack of goals. As detailed on Mail Sport before the fixture, Mohamed Salah has been sub-par and a long way from his best. Or as club legend and Sky pundit Jamie Carragher put it, 'A shadow of himself, especially after his injury.'\n\nDarwin Nunez has shown glimpses of the \u00a385million striker he is across two years on Merseyside but much of that time has been spent frustrating fans. One incident in this game saw him run through on goal only to fire straight at Jordan Pickford.\n\nFans are now fed up of making excuses for the Uruguayan forward, though obviously there are plenty of red-hot, reactionary takes after a loss. Luis Diaz left the game with some credit - the only attack-minded Reds player to do so - but he does not add enough goals to the team.\n\nDarwin Nunez has become a scapegoat amid his frustrating performances for Liverpool\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (right) has played within himself since Christmas after a promising start\n\nThere are plenty more scapegoats. Not one player has been at their best in the last month that has seen losses to Crystal Palace and Everton, a draw when dominant at Manchester United, plus a disappointing Europa League exit at the hands of Atalanta.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai, a \u00a365m summer signing, looked like he was going to set the Premier League alight in his first few months on these shores but has played within himself since Christmas. Andy Robertson has not found his best form after a lengthy injury lay-off.\n\nPlayers and staff internally referred to this season as 'The Last Dance', a nod to a documentary series about basketball icon Michael Jordan's final days at the Chicago Bulls. If Liverpool's season was indeed a dance, Strictly critics would bemoan too many careless errors.\n\nStill, late judge Len Goodman would probably give it a 'seveeeeen'. No one expected the Reds to challenge for the title this season so it is an overreaction to lambast them for being on par for their main goal of returning to Champions League football.\n\nBut at one point, this season promised so much. After the 'Kindergarten Kop' won the Carabao Cup, four trophies were a genuine possibility. The Klopp era looked like it was going to have a fairytale ending but, instead, the main feeling around Anfield is deflation and devastation.\n\nAs for Everton, there were probably a few sore heads this morning. Fans had waited 14 years to beat Liverpool at Goodison Park. Some kids have grown up and gone through the majority of their schooling not being able to poke fun at their Red class-mates.\n\nEvery single player could be mentioned for praise, from Jordan Pickford and his string of decisive stops to Dominic Calvert-Lewin who put in a near-perfect striker's display. He bullied Liverpool's defence in a way that no other striker has managed this season.\n\nEvery single Everton player could be mentioned for praise for their displays in the vital victory\n\nJack Harrison never stopped running, Idrissa Gana Gueye was imperious in the middle of the park, while Vitalii Mykolenko played through a nasty ankle injury to show the fighting spirit in the group. Goal-scorer Jarrad Branthwaite and skipper James Tarkowski barely put a foot wrong.\n\nBut mass credit must go to Sean Dyche. He was rightly questioned after an abhorrent 6-0 thrashing at Chelsea less than a fortnight ago. The former Burnley boss made changes to the 'feel' around Finch Farm and held honest talks with his squad, who responded in style.\n\nSo that 'you lost the league at Goodison Park' will be a stick to poke Liverpool fans with for years to come. It might be the penultimate derby at this iconic venue but this win means the final one will be as a Premier League club.\n\nDyche's voice box is iffy at the best of times so the boss must barely be able to speak today, after barking orders and metaphorically kicking every ball on the touchline. This was a tactical masterclass sporting his lucky-charm tracksuit. At least it'll save him from ironing duties today.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I can only apologise for today to the people. We should have done better but we didn't.\"\n\nIn other play at Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shootout win after blowing a three-goal lead against second-tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nAttwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle.\n\nMateta broke the deadlock in the 55th minute and added the second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of qualifying for Europe.", "source": {"uri": "khmertimeskh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khmer Times"}, "authors": [],

It all comes down to mentality,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I think our result played a part in Arsenal's result. They have potentially got too excited and thought this is our chance, this is what we need to do.\n\n\"Maybe they overthought things whereas if us and City both won it made them think, 'we need to just win' rather than it being a chance to breakaway from the pack. None of us have been in a three-horse race, so it's difficult.\"\n\nAlmost a week after those those comments and Arsenal bounced back from that disappointing defeat with a 2-0 win over Wolves, while Liverpool picked up all three points against Fulham.\n\nBut the Reds failed to keep up with their title rivals on Wednesday night and now, they sit three points behind leaders Arsenal, who recorded a convincing 5-0 win over Chelsea on Tuesday.\n\nThe Gunners also have a superior goal difference, which could spell the end of Liverpool's chances.\n\nJamie Carragher believes Liverpool's title hopes are all but over after their latest defeat.\n\nIn the aftermath of Wednesday's clash at Goodison Park, he told Sky Sports: \"It's Everton's night.

Palace made absolutely sure of Premier League safety with an impressive 2-0 home defeat of Newcastle United with both goals scored by Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nIt was a well-deserved win for the hosts while Newcastle's European hopes were dealt a blow with a 10th away defeat.\n\nMateta put Palace ahead with a well-worked goal in the 54th minute after a one-two with Jordan Ayew.\n\nHe sealed the

In midfield Alexis Mac Allister was regularly hurried out of possession while the front three did not give the impression of knowing what the goal even looked like with Darwin Nunez woefully below the level required.\n\nThe hosts' positive approach seemed to have paid off after just six minutes when Calvert-Lewin was brought down by Alisson Becker after nicking Jack Harrison's outside-of-the-boot pass past him but the penalty was rescinded after VAR ruled the striker was offside.\n\nBen Godfrey, who headed wide a Dwight McNeil free-kick, slid in to divert behind Mohamed Salah's goalbound angled shot from Trent Alexander-Arnold's delightfully-chipped pass into the penalty area with Curtis Jones and Nunez waiting to turn it in.\n\nHaving people in the right place at the right time was a theme of the first half as Jordan Pickford saved from Nunez, Luis Diaz and Andy Robertson - although the first two made his job easier by shooting straight at him.\n\nThe goal Everton deserved came in the 27th minute when Branthwaite forced the ball under Alisson and in off the post after Liverpool made a mess of clearing a free-kick with Konate getting in the way of Mac Allister.\n\nPickford then came to the fore as Nunez blasted at him rather than opting for the more open left side of the goal, then blocked Diaz's volley with his legs from Nunez's nod on and finally stuck out an arm to repel Robertson's shot from a narrow angle.\n\nAnother poor performance from Salah saw him scuff a shot into Branthwaite, sparing him the embarrassment of seeing it sail wide, but then slashed the rebound into the Gwladys Street.\n\nIn keeping with the emerging pattern over recent weeks Liverpool faded after the break after Virgil van Dijk headed straight at Pickford and when McNeil's long-range shot was tipped over, Calvert-Lewin rose unchallenged at the far post to nod home the resulting corner.\n\nDyche and his team had done a brilliant job of exposing Liverpool's weakness as that was the sixth successive time Klopp's side had failed to win the first ball at a set-piece.\n\nBranthwaite could have added further embarrassment but headed wide while the closest Liverpool came to a response was when Diaz's curling shot rebounded off the post and they played out the final minutes with 'you lost the league at Goodison Park' ringing around the ground.", "source": {"uri": "newsletter.co.uk",

It is very disappointing. We played the game Everton wanted and they scored two goals from set-pieces. We should have done better but we didn't,\" said Klopp.\n\n\"No good thoughts at all. Very disappointed and frustrated. It was not good enough.\n\n\"It was not the most inspired performance of all time, I really feel for the people. We never lost here (it was Everton's first Goodison derby win in almost 14 years) and it feels really different. I really apologise for that.\n\n\"I can't say now that we are still fully in it; we need a crisis at Man City and Arsenal and need to win football games because if they start losing all their games and we do what we did tonight nothing changes.\n\n\"We are not safe in the Champions League as well so we should just play better football.\n\n\"It is not a problem of attitude or what the boys want.

Terrific on Sunday. I am pleased for the club, only the second win in 30 (derbies) I am told.\n\n\"I think the game was won in the tactical delivery of the team.

It was hard to argue otherwise, even if the ideal scenario of sending Jurgen Klopp into the sunset with a second winners' medal was always an outside bet given Arsenal's form and Manchester City's, well, everything.\n\nLFC RATINGS: Darwin Nunez really bad but two others shocking against Everton\n\nLIVE UPDATES: All the reaction as Everton beat Liverpool 2-0 at Goodison Park\n\nIn the cold light of day, a more sober assessment of the campaign will reflect on progress, improvements and adjustments that have almost certainly brought about the return of Champions League football for next season, which will be contested by a new manager in the hotseat for the first time since October 2015.\n\nBut before those measured takes and sage opinions can begin to make sense of all this, Reds supporters will vent, they will fume and they will, with justification, argue just why their team were once more attempting to pull it out of the fire as the match entered the final throes.\n\nKlopp is undoubtedly one of the greats from both a club history perspective and of the current operators across European football but his inability to fix a glaring, season-long problem of starting slowly has undermined their pursuit of glory.\n\nA league-high of 27 points earned from losing positions has showcased the bags of mental resilience and quality Liverpool have when they are up against it but relying on that too much in recent weeks - against Crystal Palace at home and here, during this miserable 2-0 reverse, most notably - has left them entering the final four fixtures of Klopp's historic tenure now praying for the mother of all slip-ups from both Arsenal and City.\n\nGoals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin condemned the manager to his first Merseyside derby defeat on this side of Stanley Park and the first in front of a paying crowd, who duly lapped up the events on the pitch with the sort of gusto that derby day demands.\n\nThat, perhaps, was the difference here; Everton played with the kind of fire and fury expected of a local skirmish while too many of Liverpool's players looked like they needed telling who the opposition were.\n\nIt didn't need to be blood and thunder, and the sort of tackles that risked red cards, but of all the tactical and technical shortcomings on the day, the biggest indictment was that the visitors didn't treat the occasion with the respect it deserved. For too many it seemed to be just another game at the tail end of a long, exhausting campaign. The irony now is those last quartet of fixtures might just be exactly that.\n\nAn Everton team who have won just three of the last 17 are able to count Klopp's title-chasers among them and at the exact wrong time of the season, the Reds have run out of ideas, energy and, for their manager at least, time.\n\nA return to the top table of European football, which is always the first measure of success in the Anfield boardrooms, will be marked down as significant given the struggles of last term but this will hurt for now. And it has to, because Liverpool cannot shrug this one off as a poor day at the office; this defeat must fester and rankle in the dressing room.\n\nFor what is by now the umpteenth time this season, the Reds were slow out of the blocks and didn't start the game with the urgency that their general situation, the magnitude of the fixture or the atmosphere demanded. They were indebted to the offside lines early on after Alisson Becker had brought down Calvert-Lewin when clean through.\n\nThat should have been the alarm call that woke Klopp's side up but they hit the snooze button once more and were eventually punished when Jarrad Branthwaite bundled home after some penalty-box pinball. Defensively it was a shambles and the offside lines would not be in their favour this time.\n\nChances came and went through Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Andy Robertson but Jordan Pickford was equal to them all as the Reds were once more unable to provide a clinical touch to presentable opportunities. How their inability to show a ruthless streak has cost them in recent weeks.\n\nNunez in particular was guilty. Too often the Uruguayan's touch was loose and when given the chance for his big moment in the first period, he opted to smash the ball at Pickford rather than apply the requisite finesse.\n\nEighteen goals this season more than suggests there is a player in there but Liverpool will continue to be hamstrung if the only finish the \u00a364m striker has in the locker is the Hulk Smash. The No.9 was little more than a disinterested onlooker in the second half and would have been hooked had Cody Gakpo not missed the game due to his partner going into labour.\n\nNunez needs a strong finish to the campaign but it would be unfair to single just him out for criticism. Mohamed Salah looked like a pale imitation of the player who shone before that hamstring injury at the Africa Cup of Nations back in January while Ibrahima Konate was hauled off after enduring a nightmare of an evening up against Calvert-Lewin. Dominik Szoboszlai was once more off the pace and Alexis Mac Allister looks in need of a real rest.\n\nLuis Diaz, the one performer to emerge with credit, rattled the inside of the post in the second period but they never truly looked like getting back into the game after Calvert-Lewin had steered home a second from a corner before the hour mark.\n\nLiverpool might privately lament that their negotiations with Feyenoord over manager Arne Slot became public knowledge just hours before such a vital game but there can be no excuse making here.\n\nThe Reds got what they deserved and having done so much to delay the Jurgen Klopp Farewell Tour for so long, as they chased more glory to the Carabao Cup triumph, it now looks like it is the only show in town.

CLICK HERE TO ADD TO YOUR BETSLIP.\n\nEverton v Liverpool\n\nPremier League match at the Goodison Park, Liverpool\n\nTV: Sky Sports Premier League/Main Event, Wednesday, 8pm\n\nThe final Merseyside derby of the season is upon us and there's more than bragging rights at stake with Liverpool deep into a Premier League title challenge and Everton fighting to keep their place for next season. There's always blood and thunder in the Merseyside derby and Wednesday's game under the Goodison Park floodlights will be no different.\n\nLiverpool -1\n\nEverton have picked up two wins and two clean sheets in their past two home games but don't let that stat fool you, they are miles off Liverpool and picked those wins up against relegation-threatened Nottingham Forest and Burnley.\n\nIn the past two months, we've seen West Ham, Manchester United, and most recently Chelsea beat them by at least two goals, and title-chasing Liverpool should repeat that here. Everton have scored fewer goals than anybody except for Sheffield United and Liverpool are the league's second-highest scorers and have covered a -1 handicap in three of the past four meetings against the Toffees.\n\nMohamed Salah to Score or Assist\n\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah is now 27 games deep into his Premier League season and he's had 26 goal contributions. He's found the back of the net 17 times and set up nine goals for his teammates, as he continues to have another impressive season.\n\nHe leads Liverpool in shots per game and ranks third in key passes. Not to mention the fact that he got a brace the last time these teams met. With Everton's struggles, there's a very real chance that Salah either scores, or creates, a goal this Wednesday.\n\nDon't forget about our new Super Sub offer where if you back a player in certain markets, if they're substituted their picks transfer over to who they've been replaced by. Read more about Paddy Power's Super Sub offer here.\n\nIdrissa Gueye to Commit 2 or more Fouls\n\nIdrissa Gueye scored Everton's opener in their controversial win over Forest at the weekend but here we're backing him to commit two or more fouls. He gave up just one foul against Forest but against a far superior Liverpool midfield, who'll be throwing players forward, he should exceed it.\n\nHe's played just 20 league games this season but has collected 31 cards. On a minute-by-minute basis, he's averaging 1.88 fouls committed per 90 minutes. That should increase given the derby atmosphere and quality of the opposition.\n\nIdrissa Gueye to be Shown a Card\n\nIf we're going to see the Senegalese midfielder commit two or more fouls then it's highly likely we're also going to see him getting his name in Andy Madley's book too. Madley is averaging 3.9 yellow cards per game, having dished out 78 across 20 games officiated this season.\n\nGueye has seven yellows this season, just one behind Jarrad Branthwaite and two behind James Tarkowski, despite playing 10 and 13 games less than each of them receptively. His 34-year-old legs might struggle against Liverpool's midfield and he'll have a tough evening.\n\nHarvey Elliot to be Fouled 1 or more Times\n\nIt was a good performance against Fulham from Harvey Elliot with the 21-year-old picking up an assist. That's likely to be enough to get him the start here and if he plays then he's going to cause Everton issues, issues that are likely to see him get fouled.\n\nHe's got a great range of passing and has started to look more of a threat this season, taking a real leap forward with his game. He won a foul against Fulham at the weekend and if he performs well again on Wednesday, he's more than likely going to earn at least one more freekick.\n\nAll prices are bang up to date with our snazzy widgets, while odds in copy are accurate at time of publishing but subject to change.\n\nTHE PADDY POWER GUIDE TO SAFER GAMBLING - EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW", "source": {"uri": "news.paddypower.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddy Power News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_farley@news.paddypower.com", "name": "Sam Farley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrissa_Gueye", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Idrissa Gueye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Tarkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Madley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Madley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/news.paddypower.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/Liverpool-v-Everton-Wed-pm.png?fit=991%2C624&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The Portugal defender had been keen to remain at Goodison as he was settled in the area.\n\nBut with his contract running down and no new deal agreed, he was given the green light to depart during the 2002 January transfer window, allowing Everton to pick up a transfer fee.

He said: \"In terms of sporting and economic objectives, I didn't really have a choice.\n\n\"Liverpool were offering me Champions League football.

The result leaves Jurgen Klopp's side needing Arsenal and Manchester City to both slip up if they're to stand any chance of winning the Premier League title for the first time since 2020.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports after the loss, Van Dijk made reference to the early kick-off time for Saturday's trip to West Ham. It will be the Reds' sixth Saturday lunchtime kickoff of the season, albeit just their second of 2024 after a victory at Brentford in February.\n\nReds boss Jurgen Klopp, who is in his final season in charge, has hit out at schedulers over the early kick-offs in the past. Rooney had no time for Van Dijk bringing up the timing of the West Ham game, though, indicating Klopp's team ought to want to put Wednesday's defeat behind them as soon as possible.\n\n\"I think the worrying thing there is - and I think it's happened a lot throughout the season as well is - the captain saying about Liverpool getting outfought, but again we're hearing about 12.30 kickoffs after they've lost a derby,\" Rooney told Sky Sports. \"That Liverpool team should want to be out there tomorrow morning to get the next game going.\n\n\"When you lose a game, especially a derby game, you should want the next game to come quick. But we've heard it so many times, about Liverpool and 12.30 kickoffs. Get on with it! That's part of your job. You should be ready to play.\"\n\nLiverpool have four wins and a draw from their five Saturday 12.30 kick-offs this term. However, one of those games - a clash with title rivals Manchester City in November - prompted a vigorous response from Klopp.\n\nDo you agree with Wayne Rooney? Have your say in the comments section\n\nEverton's win was just their second against Liverpool in the Jurgen Klopp era\n\n\"OK, no one can say at the moment, but how can you put a game like this on Saturday at 12.30pm?\" the German said at the time. \"Honestly, the people making the decisions, they cannot feel football, it's just not possible.\n\n\"And if that's the moment where the world pays the most to see a football game then nobody has told us. I don't know if that's the case, I really don't.\"\n\nAs for the Everton defeat on Wednesday, Klopp was brutally honest in his assessment. \"Nothing more to say about this tonight, we conceded two goals from set pieces and we know it is one of their strengths,\" he told Match of the Day.\n\n\"The second one is a routine they use all season. It makes no sense. I thought we found a way into the game and pushed them back, created massive chances and didn't use one of them. We conceded a second goal then and we lost momentum. We couldn't turn it around, it just wasn't good enough. That is the truth.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Everyone has to look in the mirror and look at their own performance and think if they gave everything.\n\n\"It is a tough one and obviously we have to do better against a side near the relegation [positions].\n\n\"If you play like today we have no chance to consider ourselves in the title race.\"\n\nVan Dijk mentioned Liverpool's next game being an early kick-off at West Ham on Saturday.\n\nFormer Everton and England striker Wayne Rooney, a studio guest for Sky's match coverage, said: \"The worrying thing there is - and I think it's happened a lot throughout the season as well - again we are hearing about 12:30 kick-offs after he's just lost a derby.\n\n\"He should be wanting, and that Liverpool team should be wanting, to be on the pitch tomorrow morning to get the next game going, because when you lose, especially in a derby, you want the next game to come quick.\n\n\"We've heard it so many times this season with Liverpool about 12:30 kick-offs.

That was a great moment. Last second of the game, when I saw it I could feel it.\n\n'It was outstanding. Nobody expected it we all thought the ball was out so it wasn't. But you still had to be there and Div (Origi) had a nose for it. That was my best moment I think.'\n\nDespite enjoying Origi's last-gasp winner, Klopp did state he wasn't particularly fond of the pressure associated with the Merseyside derby.\n\nHe told reporters ahead of the game: 'The pressure is higher so why should the joy be higher? You win it, great, but why should I miss the pressure around it?\n\n'This time, when you're really playing for something, that's the pressure. But when you are both not in a great moment, it's the one game you have to win, definitely. That kind of pressure - why would I miss that? It's not enjoyable.\n\nThe German manager couldn't help but grin as he recalled the time Divock Origi snatched a 96th-minute winner to see Liverpool beat Everton 1-0 in December 2018\n\nThe Belgium international, who was given the nod by Klopp in the 84th minute, headed home the winner home from close range after Jordan Pickford failed to clear Virgil van Dijk's shot\n\nThe goal helped Liverpool close the gap on the Premier League leaders Manchester City to two points - leaving the German manager grinning from ear to ear after the game\n\n'Everyone else can only watch it and think 'oh my God, it looks exciting'. But somebody has to make the decisions, somebody has to do this, somebody has to do that.\n\n'So many people visit me always around the games and say 'we will not see that anymore or that anymore' and I just want to tell you - I work all the time while you just come here and watch the games.\n\n'I'm constantly in it, even when the game is over I can't switch off. It's not great to be in this situation all the time. Maybe other people enjoy that more than me. But that's something I definitely will not miss.'\n\nThe Liverpool manager went on to add: 'I will never be able to watch a Merseyside derby without any kind of (emotion). I feel exactly the same as everybody else around these games, but as long as I'm involved, I have to be calm.\n\n'But if I am just watching it, then I will feel a different kind of emotion, definitely. I want Liverpool to win all of them, definitely. That means it's important. I know so many people where the game means everything to them.'\n\nThe German manager finished by joking: 'I don't know when I can start enjoying watching football, we will see that.

I can only apologise for today to the people. We should have done better but we didn't.\"\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nFernandes to the rescue\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on 9 March.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shootout win after blowing a three-goal lead against second-tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\n\"I think we played quite well, also creating many more chances. Many positives. But also negatives. Conceding two goals from giveaways. It's unacceptable. We want to play dynamic, attacking football,\" Ten Hag said.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nAttwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle.\n\nMateta broke the deadlock in the 55th minute and added the second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of qualifying for Europe.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSo Jurgen Klopp will leave the Premier League with a place alongside Manuel Pellegrini, Claudio Ranieri, Roberto Mancini and Antonio Conte. Carlo Ancelotti and Kenny Dalglish, too, and they are company he will probably deem a compliment. But Klopp, one of the division's defining managers, will forever remain a one-time winner.\n\nAnd if that 2020 triumph was historic, as Liverpool's first for three decades, if his reign has come in the context of a wonderful rivalry with Pep Guardiola, it feels an inadequate reflection of a colossal contribution.\n\nKlopp will not sign off with a second Premier League; that was likely before Liverpool crossed Stanley Park, almost certain after Everton's demolition job.\n\n\"I can't say now we are fully in [the title race],\" he said. \"We need a crisis at [Manchester] City and Arsenal and need to win football games. You can read the table.\" It shows Liverpool second, but with City's games in hand rendering them very much third favourites.\n\nLiverpool 2.0 won't be Klopp's second champions. There was never a guarantee of his perfect finish when he announced his departure; Klopp knew as much, has maintained his decision would not change if Liverpool won everything or nothing and, long before Arne Slot was lined up as his successor, has accepted his lot.\n\nHe is not Sir Alex Ferguson and not merely because Klopp was surprised the Scot retracted his initial plans to retire in 2002; he would then have gone in 2012 but stayed on for an extra year to bow out as a winner. Maybe Klopp has a greater sense of perspective or a lesser hunger. He may instead bow out with the bittersweet distinction as the Premier League's greatest runner-up, the man who came second with 97 and 92 points.\n\nNow he has helped to fashion that rarity, a three-team title race. Amid the schadenfreude from Evertonians, the choruses of \"you lost the league at Goodison Park\", Liverpool have exceeded most pre-season expectations. The aim was merely to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nBut the last few weeks have been underwhelming. Since Klopp's announcement, there was a spell when it seemed Liverpool could be propelled to glory by an irresistible narrative; of comebacks and kids, of a managerial master of substitutions and a team overflowing with late goals. But the quadruple became a single, the Carabao Cup Klopp's last silverware.\n\nLiverpool won a trophy with Jayden Danns, James McConnell and Bobby Clark on the pitch this season. They will not win one with Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold or Dominik Szoboszlai in their kits. There was always an element of the improbable with Klopp; at least his final medal did not come in mundane fashion.\n\nBut Liverpool 2.0 may forever remain an unfinished project; this season had brought a sense of renewal, as though it was a springboard to potentially being Klopp's second great team in 2025 or 2026. Now, whatever happens with someone else in the dugout, it never will be. Encouraging as so many aspects have been, they have not touched the heights of the team of 2018-20, who won the Champions League and the Premier League, who amassed 196 points in two seasons.\n\nThis side have been entertainingly flawed. Liverpool have had fewer clean sheets than Everton, conceding first in 16 league games alone. In part, it reflects on Ibrahima Konate's mixed season and, apart from a four-month spell in mid-season when Wataru Endo excelled, the lack of a high-class defensive midfielder after Fabinho's departure. Liverpool's squad players kept them in contention for eight months: so, too, their capacity to score.\n\nYet that has deserted them of late. They had 23 shots and Everton 23 percent of possession. They had lost to Atalanta and Crystal Palace with 19 and 21 attempts at goal respectively, scoring in neither. A team with 131 goals this season are suddenly struggling to score.\n\nIt is in part because Mohamed Salah may be in the worst form of his Liverpool career, while Darwin Nunez's capacity for misses has become costly while Diogo Jota, as he too often is, is sidelined again. Of all the great Liverpool managers, Klopp is the most innately attacking. At the last, his attack is misfiring.\n\nAnd for a manager who attributed his own decision to leave to the realisation his energy levels are not bottomless, his team have started to look drained: of verve, of ideas, of the Kloppian capacity to carry on regardless and conjure something special. \"Not the most inspired performance of all time,\" said Klopp.\n\nHe might have won the title in 2019 but for a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park; he almost certainly will not win it in 2024 after a 2-0 defeat. \"We were not good enough,\" he concluded. They have been for the vast majority of this season and the vast majority of his reign.\n\nBut it has only brought him one league title and, without Klopp, the question is of when Liverpool will win their next and if it will be under Slot.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Dalglish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Dalglish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Mancini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Mancini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Ranieri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudio Ranieri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciaran_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ciaran Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabinho_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fabinho (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/25/08/SEI201288306.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Liverpool's Premier League title hopes are all but over after a tired performance saw them lose at neighbours Everton on Wednesday.\n\nDespite creating more chances and enjoying most of the possession, few could argue against a deserved 2-0 defeat that leaves them three points behind leaders Arsenal with a vastly inferior goal difference and only four games remaining.\n\nIt made for a forgettable evening at Goodison. And here's how the national media, and the ECHO's own Paul Gorst, viewed another dramatic day in the season for Jurgen Klopp's side.\n\nPAUL GORST: Liverpool get what they deserve for not fixing problem that has ruined title chances\n\nIAN DOYLE: Dominik Szoboszlai becomes a major concern as Darwin Nunez question needs answering\n\nPaul Joyce of The Times - and formerly of this parish - points to Liverpool rather foolishly falling into an obvious trap set by Blues boss Sean Dyche.\n\n\"The Premier League leaders Arsenal, three points ahead and with a far healthier goal difference, and Manchester City, who have games in hand, will not falter to the extent Liverpool now need and the unpalatable, inescapable truth is that their challenge has ended with little more than a whimper,\" he pens.\n\n\"Yet this was Everton's night. Dyche pointed out that winning on the final day of last season against Bournemouth to keep the club in the top flight represented his best moment, but this will not be far behind. There has been plenty of chatter about the direct style of play under him, though fewer dissenting voices on Wednesday night as he did a number on vaunted opponents.\n\n\"Far too often Liverpool naively conceded free kicks in their own half\u00ad -- some obvious, some less so \u00ad -- and the inability to recognise that this was a route to ruin was alarming.\"\n\nAndy Hunter, another formerly of this publication and now at The Guardian, questioned the desire of the Reds.\n\n\"Quite simply, Everton wanted it more,\" he writes. \"That is damning of the team that arrived with designs on the title and in need of responding to Arsenal's emphatic defeat of Chelsea the night before. Liverpool have faltered at the worst possible time and in the worst possible places from their perspective. Everton and Manchester United will savour their contributions to the slump.\n\n\"Liverpool were missing Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo, the latter joining the injured striker on the sidelines after his partner went into labour hours before kick-off. They were also missing composure for long periods and a clinical touch in front of goal, with the toils of Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah continuing.\"\n\nThe Telegraph's Chris Bascombe - also once of these parts - regards the derby as being a throwback to the old days and Liverpool weren't ready for it.\n\n\"Liverpool looked like a side more prepared for a fight for Champions League places, punching above its weight with title aspirations,\" he says. \"They did not look like championship contenders, let alone champions-in-waiting.\n\n\"Nor did they have the muscle or wisdom to deal with a derby tussle which put one in mind of those in the 80s and 90s, when the right to play was as significant as the ability to do so.\n\n\"Where and when it mattered, Everton demonstrated both, and once Jarrad Branthwaite pounced to beat Alisson from close range, Liverpool lacked the class and nous to recover.\"\n\nFinally, Paul Gorst of the ECHO highlights the fact Liverpool's continued inability to start games strongly has eventually come back to haunt them.\n\n\"In the cold light of day, a more sober assessment of the campaign will reflect on progress, improvements and adjustments that have almost certainly brought about the return of Champions League football for next season, which will be contested by a new manager in the hotseat for the first time since October 2015,\" he scribes.\n\n\"But before those measured takes and sage opinions can begin to make sense of all this, Reds supporters will vent, they will fume and they will, with justification, argue just why their team were once more attempting to pull it out of the fire as the match entered the final throes.\n\n\"Klopp is undoubtedly one of the greats from both a club history perspective and of the current operators across European football but his inability to fix a glaring, season-long problem of starting slowly has undermined their pursuit of glory.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk",

Jurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick. With Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.\n\nSecond-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left. Third-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton on Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper. It hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February. Back then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.\n\nInstead, the end of Klopp's nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.\n\n\"Arsenal and Manchester City must have a very bad moment,\" Klopp said when asked if Liverpool can win the title. \"I don't know. I can only apologise for today to the people. We should have done better but we didn't.\"\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nAlso read: Pep Guardiola backs referees amid Nottingham Forest controversy, says 'never had doubts' over their integrity\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left. Rasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League. Ten Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shootout win after blowing a three-goal lead against second-tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\n\"I think we played quite well, also creating many more chances. Many positives. But also negatives. Conceding two goals from giveaways. It's unacceptable. We want to play dynamic, attacking football,\" Ten Hag said.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux. Attwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener. Attwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle. Mateta broke the deadlock in the 55th minute and added the second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of qualifying for Europe.", "source": {"uri":

Branthwaite then capitalised on defensive disarray to break the deadlock, squeezing home from close range amid chaotic scenes in the Liverpool box.\n\nDespite chances for Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah before half-time, Liverpool could not find an equaliser.

Get on with it! That's part of your job, get on with it!

If they start losing all their games and we do what we did tonight then nothing will change and we're not safe in the Champions League (places) either.\n\n\"We should just play better football. You can see we are in a rush in front of the goal. You cannot act like you have scored 15 goals in the last two games. You have to fight through these periods.\n\n\"People ask me about mentality but it has different aspects. It is not a problem of attitude or whether the boys want it. No one is doing anything like that on purpose. It is my job to bring them into a situation where they feel confident to do it. That is the most tricky part of football. I am responsible. In the moment it didn't work out. We have to keep trying.\"\n\nKlopp must now lift his players with Liverpool back in action on Saturday in the lunchtime kick-off away to West Ham.\n\n\"We have to recover as a quick turnaround is waiting for us,\" he said.\n\n\"It will be a challenge both mentally and physically. Probably West Ham is waiting and rubbing their hands and hoping we come there on one leg, but I will try absolutely everything to make sure we are much more ourselves there.\n\n\"I would prefer to be sitting here winning 4-0 and flying. The job is to win football games and the more you win the more successful you are and in the moment we didn't win enough to get anything out of the season yet.

The performance and level of the performance was top notch. I want to play beautiful football but I want to play winning football first.\n\n\"This is not as satisfying as the final game of last season (when they escaped relegation with a win over Bournemouth) but it is satisfying to give something back. It is a different kind of satisfaction, believe me.\"", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/fBWBtiNWNyGD-q99Bq_rFU4ahx4=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/XVF4GZTAAZHJ7GYFRJ4PFOZ75Y.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

He made five saves, including one that came straight from Nunez.\n\nVitalii Mykolenko - 5 - Picked up a severe ankle injury that ended his game before the stroke of half-time.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite - 9 - The youngster found himself in the right place to give Everton a deserved lead, which complimented another solid defensive showing.\n\nJames Tarkowski - 8.5 - No one epitomises the grit associated with Sean Dyche's football better than Tarkowski, who served him well at Burnley before reuniting here. This was another tenacious performance.\n\nBen Godfrey - 7 - Had the unenviable task of keeping tabs on Luis Diaz, who has been flying. Godfrey gave a good account of himself and made some critical interventions.\n\nDwight McNeil - 7.5 - Stepped up on the Everton flank, creating five goal-scoring opportunities, including another Premier League assist.\n\nJames Garner - 7 - A selfless performance in the heart of Everton's midfield. Garner quietly went about his business covering for those in front of him.\n\nIdrissa Gueye - 7.5 - You know what you're getting from the Senegalese defensive midfielder who regularly won possession as Liverpool regularly dominated proceedings.\n\nJack Harrison - 7 - Another who has stepped up for Everton during another difficult campaign, the former Leeds winger attempted five take-ons, winning four.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 - 7.5 - Playing in a deep-lying forward role, the languid Doucour\u00e9 looked to bring the ball forward as much as possible, and when he did, chaos often followed.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin - 9 - He worked hard as Everton's lone centre-forward, winning half his 14 duels before powering home a header from McNeil's corner. He kept Liverpool's central defensive pairing busy.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nAshley Young (for Mykolenko 46) - 5.5 - Perhaps this would have been an off day. Still, the former England international came on and wasn't troubled by a Liverpool team chasing Premier League honours.\n\nAlisson - 5 - He could have done nothing for Calvert-Lewin's goal, but he would have been frustrated not to have kept a clean sheet.\n\nAndy Robertson - 4.5 - Had no issue marauding down the left flank but couldn't find that killer ball, which often comes easily for him.\n\nVirgil van Dijk - 5 - The first to enter Andy Madley's book after showcasing dissent, a rare moment lacking composure from the oft-cool Dutchman.\n\nIbrahima Konat\u00e9 - 4 - This was a below-par showing from a usually reliable defensive presence. He couldn't deal with Calvert-Lewin, which permanently ended his game.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - 4 - Saw ample time on the ball, though his lackadaisical defending from an Everton corner would make headlines.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister - 5.5 - The numbers suggest it was another typical Mac Allister performance, but he, more than anyone, would be disappointed with this result.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai -4 - He couldn't get into this game with one throwaway effort from a distance, the highlight before going off after the hour mark.\n\nCurtis Jones - 4 - An interesting selection that didn't pay off for Klopp, as Jones seemed off pace.\n\nLuis D\u00edaz - 4.5 - Unlucky not to score with a second-half effort crashing off the post. He wasn't his usual buzzing self.\n\nDarwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez - 4 - In recent weeks, the perception of Nunez has changed, but tonight, he reverted to a more frustrating version. Guilty of poor ball control and finishing.\n\nMohamed Salah - 4.5 - It was a less-than-stellar outing for the Egyptian forward, who enjoyed previous Goodison Park visits.\n\nJarell Quansah (for Konat\u00e9 63) - 4 - A like-for-like replacement, but the damage was already done as Everton cooled off in attack.", "source": {"uri": "squawka.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Squawka"},

survive scare", "body": "Liverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United Wednesday.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.\n\nWith Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalize, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.\n\nSecond-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.\n\nThird-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton and Hove Albion Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.\n\nIt hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February.\n\nBack then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.\n\nInstead, the end of Klopp's nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalized before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equalizer before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shoot win after blowing a three-goal lead against second tier Coventry City Sunday.\n\nThe Blades are 10 points from safety with only four games left as they sink towards relegation just one year after promotion from the Championship.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolverhampton Wanderers goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as Video Assistant Referee in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton Town.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equalizer, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nIt was not spotted in real time but Attwell opted to give the foul following advice from VAR Darren England to watch it again on the pitchside monitor.\n\nAttwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle United.\n\nMateta broke the deadlock at Selhurst Park with a smart 55th-minute finish before he added a second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of securing European football for next season.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPalace 2 (Mateta 55, 88) Newcastle 0\n\nEverton 2 (Branthwaite 27, Calvert-Lewin 58) Liverpool 0\n\nMan Utd 4 (Maguire 42,

The man who was under contract for a couple more years, who had masterminded their return to one of Europe's dominant forces, revealed he'd be leaving once the season drew to an end. The German claimed he was \"running out of energy\".\n\nAfter the shock had subsided attention immediately switched to sending Klopp off in the best possible fashion. Riding into the sunset with more silverware to his name, departing in a blaze of glory. Another Premier League title perhaps? More European glory too?\n\nIt was the dream scenario. In the cold morning after Klopp lost his unbeaten record at Goodison Park, the reality couldn't be more different.\n\nThe announcement of Klopp's departure was always going to go one of two ways. A club that so often draw on emotion had the chance to use it as fuel and build on their five point lead at the top of the table. The Carabao Cup final was just round the corner, another FA Cup remained on the table and they were firm favourites to claim the Europa League.\n\nWembley victory over Chelsea, owing to a Virgil van Dijk header, fed the narrative that Klopp's departure had only given Liverpool more motivation. The manager had increasingly begun to back youth in an effort to leave the Reds in a promising position.\n\nThe fall begins\n\nNine days after Klopp's announcement Liverpool were beaten at Arsenal, opening the door for their title rivals. Manchester City too were waiting in the wings and the Reds, in four games against their main two rivals this season, have only taken three points.\n\nMarch is where the first big dent took place - a defeat at Old Trafford in the FA Cup. Manchester United score their winning goal in the 120th minute to end Klopp's fairytale ending. The German then didn't endear himself when he took on a foreign journalist in a post-match interview.\n\nLiverpool's Premier League hopes look to have ended at Everton\n\nA quadruple had become a treble, but within five April days it came close to ending. Liverpool suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Crystal Palace. Anfield defeats are rare but the Reds fell behind early on to an Eberechi Eze goal and failed to take their chances, opening the door for long-time adversaries City, who walked straight through to take control of the title race.\n\nDays later, again at their Anfield fortress, Atalanta came and breached their defences. All eyes were on a Liverpool-Bayer Leverkusen final in Dublin, but the Italians had other ideas. Klopp stood bemused as his backline faltered, allowing the Serie A outfit to score three times.\n\nIt gave the Reds a mammoth task in the second-leg of their quarter-final. One they ultimately couldn't overcome, winning 1-0 on the night, but ultimately going out 3-1 on aggregate.\n\nAll eyes then were fixed on the league and an unlikely City slip up. Instead, as Pep Guardiola's side watched on, it was Liverpool who slipped. Form goes out of the windows in derbies, or so they say, and Everton certainly fed off that, securing a 2-0 win at Goodison Park on Wednesday night.\n\nAs final nails in the coffin go, this was a hammer blow. Klopp could only apologise to the fans, who were always destined to idolise him regardless of how the final months of his tenure played out.\n\nAtalanta humbled the Reds at Anfield to dump them out of Europe A move too early?\n\nHindsight is a wonderful thing, but just how might've Liverpool's season looked had they kept Klopp's news under wraps. Very little stays silent nowadays and the club no doubt wanted to avoid press conferences being dominated by talk of a possible exit by the German if it ever got out.\n\nWayne Rooney suggested that the announcement may have begun to filter into the players' minds. Wondering perhaps what the future hold in a post-Klopp world. For the whole squad, he is all they've known and even leading lights suggested they may be reviewing their options.\n\nVirgil van Dijk had been quizzed on whether he saw himself featuring in the next era. \"That's a big question. I don't know,\" he replied. He latter clarified those comments, insisting he was \"100% committed\" to the club. Mohamed Salah is another man who could yet depart as his contract winds down.\n\nJurgen Klopp won't be getting the fairytale ending to his tenure\n\nNevertheless, the noise around the squad was an intangible factor, but one that is now being pointed at with Liverpool having to settle for one piece of silverware, unless there's a miracle, in Klopp's final season.\n\nWayne Rooney said on Sky Sports: \"That's what I was saying before about the timing of Klopp leaving. We all know how the game is. Players will look at that and see that as their way of getting out and they will be speaking to other clubs. We know that happens.\"\n\nHe also added: \"I am not saying it is his fault, but the timing of when that came out, I think that will definitely have an effect on some of those players. I think Jurgen Klopp is almost like a father figure to a lot of those players, and for them players to go from Jurgen Klopp to whoever the next manager is going to be, it is going to be different.\n\n\"It is not going to be the same as under Jurgen Klopp. Players will find that difficult and we see it throughout football. I think some of those players will want a new challenge and I think Liverpool over the next two or three years will be in a transition period.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Trying to maintain a rhythm and build momentum while keeping everyone fresh for crucial fixtures is an unenviable task. It cannot help a manager when hours before the match a starter withdraws but not even the riches of football can dictate when a mother-to-be enters labour.\n\nSean Dyche knew there was fatigue in the Liverpool ranks, considering Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez was making his 50th appearance of the season for his club, in addition to the air miles involved for Europa League travel and the international breaks in South America. Everton's most-used player is James Tarkowski, who has played 41 times, and not troubled Gareth Southgate in the process.\n\nNow Dyche has ditched his suit to become a tracksuit manager, it seems more fitting that his team have increased their work rate and physicality under the gaze of their personal trainer, rather than a bouncer. The instructions were clear: to play on the physical and mental tiredness within the Liverpool squad.\n\nIn the early stages Everton pressed relentlessly, letting those in red know the game was unlikely to be enjoyable despite the 14-place and 38-point difference in the standings before kick-off.\n\nA tired child, as Cody Gakpo is about to find out, is liable to get frustrated and angry as their bodies fight it, something Dyche wanted to exacerbate in Liverpool.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin, recovered from injury sustained on Sunday, was tasked with being the irritant striker, chasing Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Virgil van Dijk, ensuring each press included contact. They were not fouls but, like a flea bite, the more received, the more irksome the matter became.\n\nOne key ploy for Everton was to buy free-kicks anywhere from the halfway line onwards. Two Dwight McNeil set pieces resulted in the goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Calvert-Lewin as Liverpool failed to deal with the height and power of Everton in the box. Andrew Madley obliged whenever a blue shirt was touched, much to Liverpool's chagrin, explaining why Van Dijk's remonstrating earned him a yellow. It was an accumulation of issues that saw the Dutchman vent at the referee.\n\nEverton disrupted the Liverpool gameplan. The visitors became quickly distracted by the shock tactics on show from the repeated free-kicks into the box and the multi-ball system that ensured Liverpool could not switch off, even if their brains were eager for a rest and blue shirts buzzed around them. In midfield Liverpool's trio were disjointed, unable to cope with the battle they had walked into. Curtis Jones and Dominik Szoboszlai departed after just over an hour of Everton ferocity, with little to show for their war wounds. Whenever Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 motored through the middle, he was able to brush aside all-comers with ease.\n\nLiverpool had 76% of possession but were met with nine blue shirts - Calvert-Lewin did not retreat - and despite their best efforts, it was difficult to find a way through. In the final stages, few had the energy to attack for Liverpool as their attempts to progress up the pitch became more direct. The quick, sharp passing that has been instrumental this season was lost with minds and legs depleted of resources.\n\nAs has often been the case in recent weeks, Liverpool have created chances but lacked the clinical finishes required. N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Luis D\u00edaz were foiled by Jordan Pickford in the first half, while the Colombian hit the inside of the post in the second. There are fine lines when scoring and a tired mind can make the difference. Diogo Jota's and Mohamed Salah's injuries during the season have put more pressure on N\u00fa\u00f1ez and D\u00edaz, limiting Klopp's level of rotation in his front three.\n\nWithout a forward on the bench, Klopp lacked options and with Everton two goals clear and fewer than 10 minutes to go, all he had to turn to was Kostas Tsimikas and Joe Gomez. Both good players, but when an attacker was needed there was nothing the manager could do.\n\nIt has been a gruelling season for Liverpool amid their attempts to win four competitions and the emotional uncertainty provided by Klopp's summer exit.\n\nThe Everton fans sang: \"You lost the league at Goodison Park\" but the weariness has been growing and is hard to counteract. There will be no shame if Liverpool do not take their title challenge to the final days. Nine months of exertions take their toll.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_unwin@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Will

The German manager's hopes for a triumphant end to his time were shattered as his team faltered on the pitch, leaving Klopp to confront the harsh reality of missing out on the Premier League title.\n\nAs Dominic Calvert-Lewin sealed Everton's victory with a decisive goal, Klopp's stoic demeanor betrayed a sense of resignation. With Liverpool's defence faltering and their chances slipping away, Klopp could only watch as their title hopes dwindled further. The defeat against Everton dealt a severe blow to Liverpool's aspirations, leaving them trailing behind league leaders Arsenal by three points with just four games left in the season.\n\nLiverpool's defeat against Everton exposed glaring shortcomings within the team. Darwin Nunez and Ibrahima Konate's lackluster performances raised doubts about their future at the club, while Mohamed Salah's uncharacteristic struggles on the field left fans bewildered.

From steering the club to Champions League glory to revitalizing their domestic dominance, Klopp's impact on Liverpool's history is undeniable. Yet, as the final whistle blows on his tenure, Klopp must contend with the bitter disappointment of leaving without one final piece of silverware.\n\nAs the Reds regroup for the challenges ahead, Klopp's departure looms large, casting a shadow over the team's future. With uncertainties abound, Liverpool must rally together and forge ahead with renewed determination. While the road ahead may be fraught with challenges, Liverpool's resolve remains unshaken as they strive to honor Klopp's legacy and usher in a new era of success.\n\nAs Liverpool prepares to bid farewell to Jurgen Klopp, the club must honor his legacy with the dignity and respect he deserves. From the electrifying moments of glory to the heartbreaking defeats, Klopp's tenure has been a testament to the enduring spirit of Liverpool Football Club.

The pick of the bunch was to deny Nunez on 35 minutes but also made big stops against Nunez and Robertson. Pickford was an assertive presence, as usual, when claiming crosses.\n\nBen Godfrey - 7.5\n\nHas his critics in the Everton fanbase but this was an extremely solid defensive performance from Godfrey, a centre back by trade at right back due to injuries elsewhere.

Never stops running off the ball as he leads the press. He was influential in possession, too, with a whipped cross after three minutes that could have led to a goal, plus a beautiful pass for the penalty that never was.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucoure - 8\n\nHad an excellent run early in the first half that saw him skip past Alexander-Arnold as if he was not there and then feed Harrison.

Could do little for Branthwaite's goal.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold - 5\n\nQuiet start but grew in influence late in the first half with a defence-splitting pass to Nunez that nearly led to a goal and some crosses that caused problems. Struggled defensively, with McNeil skipping past him a couple of times.\n\nIbrahima Konate - 3.5\n\nNot his finest evening by any stretch of the imagination. Everton's direct style caused the Frenchman all sorts of problems, with Calvert-Lewin in particular getting the better of him. Really poor.\n\nIt was not Ibrahima Konate's finest evening by any stretch of the imagination\n\nVirgil van Dijk - 5 (Booked)\n\nA daft booking early on for dissent summed up his evening. It was a frustrating night for Van Dijk. Marking in general for Everton's second goal was abysmal, with Calvert-Lewin boasting space in abundance at the back post.\n\nAndy Robertson - 5\n\nHad a tough first half against Harrison. Nearly scored at the end of the first half with a driven, low shot but was thwarted by Pickford. Never stopped running with bursts forward but could not have an impact.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai - 4\n\nA really worrying bane of form for Liverpool's Hungarian midfielder. Looked like he was going to take the Premier League by storm in his first few months in England but has struggled somewhat since. Barely had a kick here.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister - 5\n\nHas been Liverpool's best player in 2024 probably but the Argentine World Cup winner started in his lesser-preferred position of holding midfield here and could not impact the game how he often does. Sometimes was beaten far too easily by Doucoure.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister has been Liverpool's best player in 2024 probably but the Argentine World Cup winner started in his lesser-preferred position of holding midfield here\n\nCurtis Jones - 5\n\nAnother Reds player who barely influenced the game in a positive way. Kept trying with driving runs but nothing he tried came off.\n\nMohamed Salah - 4\n\nWhen he came back from injury, many expected Salah to be the man above all to carry Liverpool to the Premier League title. But his form has been shoddy and this was another performance that left a lot to be desired, with a few uncharacteristic big misses.\n\nDarwin Nunez - 4\n\nSlip after 24 minutes summed up his game. Was given a vote of confidence to start this game after a couple on the substitutes' bench but he was poor. Had a big moment on 35 minutes but shot straight at Pickford.\n\nA slip after 24 minutes summed up Darwin Nunez's game - poor performance from the star\n\nLuis Diaz - 6 (Booked)\n\nStarted well and saw an effort nearly deflect goalwards after four minutes but was quiet thereafter. Liverpool missed injured Diogo Jota and also Cody Gakpo, attending the birth of his child. Diaz was probably the most dangerous of Liverpool's attackers but still not at his best.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nHarvey Elliott (for Jones, 63) - 5\n\nWataru Endo (for Szoboszlai, 63) - 6\n\nJarell Quansah (for Konate, 63) - 5\n\nKostas Tsimikas (for Robertson, 84)\n\nJoe Gomez (for Alexander-Arnold, 84)\n\nSubs not used: Caoimhin Kelleher, Ryan Gravenberch, Bobby Clark, Jayden Danns.", "source":

Everton, Man United survive Blades scare", "body": "Liverpool's Argentinian midfielder Alexis Mac Allister (10) reacts after the match against Everton. -- AFP\n\nLiverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.\n\nWith Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.\n\nSecond-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.\n\nThird-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton on Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.\n\nIt hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February.\n\nBack then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.\n\nInstead, the end of Klopp's nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarterfinals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shoot win after blowing a three-goal lead against second tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\nThe Blades are 10 points from safety with only four games left as they sink towards relegation just one year after promotion from the Championship.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nIt was not spotted in real time but Attwell opted to give the foul following advice from VAR Darren England to watch it again on the pitchside monitor.\n\nAttwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth

Van Dijk missed header\n\nEverton had looked to test Liverpool's defence with crosses whipped into the box and Dwight McNeil's free-kick was a beauty, but that does not excuse Virgil van Dijk completely misjudging the flight of the ball to allow Branthwaite to get ahead and rise above Dominik Szoboszlai to win the initial header.\n\n2. Feeble attempt to clear from Alexander-Arnold\n\nLiverpool survived the first wave but questions had to be asked about Trent Alexander-Arnold's defending as he made a half-hearted attempt to flick the ball clear with his head. It enables James Tarkowski to put it back into the mixer.\n\n3. Robertson block but still nobody clears\n\nThe Liverpool full-back does well to stand his ground to block a shot from the unmarked Ben Godfrey but the ping pong inside the box continues.\n\n4. Konate's unwanted assist\n\nAfter Robertson makes the block, Konate deflects the ball across the six-yard box, perfectly into the path of Branthwaite who is left in too much space after getting back to his feet after winning the initial header.\n\n5. Alisson dives over the ball\n\nBranthwaite's strike is not a clean one and maybe the Liverpool goalkeeper expected it to be as he completely misjudges his dive, the ball squirming under his body and trickling across the goal line via the inside of the post.\n\nWatch the full calamity unfold here...", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_edwards@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Luke Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Godfrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Godfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Tarkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2024/04/24/TELEMMGLPICT000375128128_17139907557710_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxLDOUwO1qAETUgSFUTfLkKgsGXkloWhsWjd_kiZoa6Y.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

It's clear to get all the things going. We didn't qualify for the Champions League last year, that's financially a real problem for a football club like us.\n\n'So we built a squad to fight for the Champions League again. In the league, there are six or seven teams - Manchester City, Arsenal, Villa, Tottenham made the next step, then not really involved is Manchester United and Chelsea.\n\nJurgen Klopp insisted that the main goal for the season was to secure Champions League qualification\n\nKlopp claimed that the Reds took a big financial hit by not featuring in Europe's premier club competition\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n'It was clear those teams would be there. Four spots to fight for and we have (put up a fight). And we have. That's a massive achievement already. That's the job we have to do. And if you are there, and it's not a distance too far - you want to fight for everything.\n\n'For us, and in general a lesson for life, and not even just for football, you should never forget where you're coming from. That means you can really enjoy the moment and go for it. Now it looks like in this one week, from that moment we had something to lose.\n\n'I don't get that, all of a sudden things change. Wow! It's like, \"I'm not sure if he can still do it\" and stuff like this. Yes, we don't have it in our own hands, who had that in the past? City from time to time.\n\n'We cannot become favourites overnight and have something to lose. And be really down if we do this or don't do that. That's how everyone wants to see it. It's just not the way I see it. For me, we are where we should be, now let's make the absolute best of it.\n\n'If that means we win the league then I will be quite happy. As long as there's a chance for that I'll be quite happy.'\n\nLiverpool will have to overcome bitter city rivals Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday night and a win would see the Reds go four points clear of Manchester City - though the reigning champions would have two games in hand.\n\nKlopp added that the Goodison Park atmosphere can be febrile and he has learned about the importance of the Merseyside Derby during his eight and a half years at Anfield. 'My feeling and understanding has developed over the years,' he added.\n\nLiverpool have a chance to go four clear of Manchester City against Everton on Wednesday\n\n'Always difficult games especially there. At home it was more comfortable. Only Carlo Ancelotti who everyone knows now he is a really good manager, we lost against. This is a super important game for us.\n\n'It's about intensity. Goodison Park can create a good atmosphere as well. For the players, if you play Liverpool, it's much more than three points. That's the way everybody sees it there.

But that's something I definitely will not miss.\"\n\nAnd so his weary players trooped across Stanley Park to be throttled by a sinewy, insurgent Everton. Liverpool are frankly not good enough to avoid at least part of every game becoming a streetfight, and tonight they didn't have Everton's appetite for the fight.\n\nIt was summed up a few minutes before the hour mark. Virgil van Dijk swept up a loose ball and nodded it down to Mo Salah, whose attempted touch was diffident and lame. An Everton player leaped onto possession - they were first to everything, always - and they swept forward for Dwight McNeil's snapshot to be pushed over the crossbar by Alisson.\n\nNo matter. Everton hoiked the corner to the backpost where Dominic Calvert-Lewin rose completely unmarked to head the ball in. Virgil van Dijk protested at being blocked, but Trent Alexander-Arnold stood cowering and rooted to the ground, looking like an airfield passer-by who was frightened by the noise of the jet engines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that was that for Liverpool.\n\nLuis Diaz slalomed forward a few minutes later and hit the post. From the moment it didn't go in, Liverpool gave up the ghost as it was all they had left to give.\n\nLiverpool have earned praise this season for their comeback qualities but it should be asked as to why they can't start playing until they fall behind: this was the 16th league game in which they conceded the first goal, but, just like against Palace and against Atalanta, this time they couldn't stir themselves for yet another comeback.\n\nThe team has collapsed in recent weeks. Perhaps this is a reversion to the mean of an over-performing team, but that makes it no less painful for Liverpool fans. From a position of having the title in their hands at the start of the month, the dream of a perfect Klopp farewell is all over, with Everton and Manchester United doing much of the damage. Ouch.\n\nThe FA Cup loss at Manchester United will be remembered as the moment something was fundamentally lost; the point at which Liverpool were shaken out of the self-perpetuating fervour that was loosed by the reaction to Klopp's exit. The desire to do well by their manager one last time gave them an enormous push, but they kicked for home too early. Now they've fallen before the finish line.\n\nBecause the team has collapsed. Even van Dijk has started to make clumsy errors, while restocked midfield options has coincided with a complete breakdown in their ability to control a game's tempo. They have vanished as an entity in recent games, with this game another in recent weeks to feature endlessly desultory, useless passing.\n\nBut of course the greatest problem has been up front. Liverpool have continued to create chances, and their forwards continue to miss them. Mo Salah appears to losing his battle with a profound career decline. Every aspect of his game has deserted him. His touch has been heavy, he has been shucked easily off the ball, he has lost the ability to dribble past an opponent, and his finishing has become anxious and wayward.\n\nAnd then there is Darwin. Across Liverpool's most important part of the season, he has flopped. Tonight was another night to show he is not good enough for this rarified level of the sport. Once picked out in space in the box he took a lumpy touch and the moment was gone, and he also wasted Liverpool's glorious chance, blasting right at Pickford one-on-one with the whole of the goal to aim for. A great big thump forward has become Darwin's signature - and often useless - finish. The first the man will have heard of the verb to Slot will be when his next manager arrives.\n\nKlopp can at least cheer himself that he has only a few terrible weeks left of having to rely on Darwin's finishing. It's the equivalent of someone needing their bet to come in to make this month's rent payment. Darwin's phone number might be the first Klopp deletes once he finishes up.\n\nLiverpool yet again missed Diogo Jota, who was injured yet again against Fulham at the weekend. The cold truth is that Liverpool have found a wretched way of giving into gravity's pull: this team has qualities and potential but it isn't yet good enough to win the league. Look at Klopp's five changes: Endo, Quansah, Elliot, Gomez, and Tsimikas. These are not game-changing subs.\n\nSo there will be no glorious farewell for Jurgen Klopp, it will be warm and rich but tinged with regret. Nobody brought a greater fight to Manchester City than Klopp's Liverpool, which effectively legitimised the Premier League as a sporting pursuit.\n\nHe was ripped off in the trophies he got in exchange and now he won't collect another. Klopp is leaving because he has met the moment in which he has no more to give.\n\nHe is weathered and beaten down and he can't deal with another press conference or another 12.30 kick-off or another whistle-swallowing referee and his team can't either. It was strangely telling that Van Dijk was talking about 12.30 kickoffs in his post-match fronting-up. Further proof that Klopp has modelled Liverpool completely in his image.\n\nTonight, that was the problem.", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gavin_cooney@the42.ie", "name": "Gavin Cooney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park,_Liverpool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Park, Liverpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostas_Tsimikas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kostas Tsimikas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gomez_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gomez (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6363387/listing?version=6363431&width=590", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But even though only the Reds had won more League Championships than Everton when the title last came to Goodison Park in 1987, the Premier League era has generally been a trail of tears for the Blues, especially these traumatic last couple of years.\n\nREAD MORE: What Everton supporters chanted in injury time sums up feeling as Goodison Park gets what it deserves\n\nREAD MORE: Wayne Rooney sends desperate message from TV studio as Liverpool star endures another Everton nightmare\n\nA whole generation of Evertonians have been weaned on an attritional diet, with relegation battles and now points deductions. But as the Blues prepare for their final season at Goodison Park and their historic move to a new stadium, legions of Merseysiders still place their allegiance to the senior club in the city with over 30,000 now on the season ticket waiting list.\n\nHere's a revelation that might shock you. I've been coming to Goodison Park for over 34 years and have covered both clubs professionally for almost two decades but this is the FIRST time I ever saw Everton beat Liverpool... honestly.\n\nI've been to hundreds of matches either side of Stanley Park, I've seen Everton beat Liverpool in the women's derby, I've seen Everton's reserve and youth teams beat their Liverpool counterparts - but not in the fixture that has been played some 244 times.\n\nFor a time, the 1990s were something of a golden era for the Blues' 'Dogs of War' against the Reds' 'Spice Boys' but while I was in the stands on those final day escapes against Wimbledon and Coventry City, the only derby 'action' I witnessed up close was a goalless pre-season stalemate in the Sir John Moores Centenary Tournament in 1996. During my three years at university I had a season ticket in the Gwladys Street but that hat-trick of games included another brace of goalless draws (the second when Everton were denied a last-second winner off Don Hutchison's backside with Graham Poll finally admitting years later he was wrong to disallow it) and then the 3-2 loss when Liverpool scored from miles out when the name 'McAllister' was associated with late goals rather than a midfielder who just went around kicking Blues players.\n\nCutting my teeth in professional journalism, I was working for the Ellesmere Port Pioneer covering Vauxhall Motors FC when Lee Carsley was the hero in 2004 and then two years later I was on honeymoon when I rushed my new - Liverpool-supporting - bride (like many in Merseyside, ours is a 'mixed marriage'), to an internet caf\u00e9 in Santa Barbara, California, to see that Everton had triumphed 3-0. Over five thousand miles away from Andrew Johnson's exploits, I was hardly going to rub it in with my nearest and dearest, while as I said on Twitter ahead of this latest derby, the beautifully-penned piece by Sam Carroll about our friend and late colleague Dan Kay taught us that you can passionately support one club in this city while also respecting both.\n\nThe vagaries of the rota saw me confined to the office for both the 2009 (unlike many, I at least saw Dan Gosling score his extra time winner on television) and 2010 (that felt rather different as Roy Hodgson's side were so bad) successes for the Blues and like most, I wasn't inside Anfield for the 2021 behind closed doors victory due to coronavirus restrictions with even press numbers limited.\n\nIn the meantime, along with thousands of others, I had to endure Mark Clattenburg's 2007 debacle, several thrashings and various other cruel and bizarrely novel ways of Everton losing to Liverpool.\n\nSo there you have it. The first Everton Derby win I've ever witnessed - in my 45th year - so any Kopites, either young or old, feeling glum today after what has been a tough few weeks by their stellar standards should put their disappointments into perspective (given how superstitious people are about football, at least nobody can blame me for being the 'Jonah' now).", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk",

Jarrod Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin were the goal scorers for Everton, as the Reds are now three points behind Arsenal.\n\nMikel Arteta's side now have a huge chance to distance themselves further in the race for the title.

I'm going to be there at the north London derby.\n\n\"It's a game I've loved over the years, probably my favourite game I've commentated on for Sky in my 11 years; it always seems to give us something, and this one has got a lot on it at the weekend, a lot on it.\n\n\"Arsenal go to that amazing stadium, and they've got to go and play. I was there a few years ago when there was a battle for the Champions League and Tottenham did them over and Arsenal didn't handle it.

For all the experience they have, they just got caught out, shocked, surprised by what they found.\n\n\"Arsenal cannot be shocked on Sunday, it's potentially going to be a bloodbath in the first 15, 20 minutes, Tottenham fans don't want Arsenal to win the league.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp namechecks two Arsenal stars after damaging Everton defeat\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal can prove title credentials by passing huge test Liverpool have already failed\n\n\"It's a big game on Sunday and it's [Liverpool's defeat to Everton] is a big lesson for Arsenal tonight.

Am I still gonna be a Liverpool player? Do I still want to be a Liverpool player?'\"\n\nKlopp's hand may well have been forced in the timing of his statement.\n\nHaving told his staff of his intention to leave in November, there was always a chance that news would get out.\n\nBut the idea that it would not have a negative impact on Liverpool's campaign was wishful thinking on the German's part.\n\nWhether consciously, or subconsciously, the knowledge that a long-serving boss was on his way, was always likely to play on the minds of his squad.\n\nThe futures of Liverpool's best two players, Mo Salah and Virgil Van Dijk, were already in doubt.\n\nBut the imminence of Klopp's exit has thrown those two situations into a sharper focus, with other players also becoming less certain about their career paths.\n\nLiverpool's injury crisis has eased significantly, yet their form has nosedived.\n\nKlopp has been an outstanding manager, yet there have been more near misses than glories during his eight-and-a-half-year reign.\n\nUnless Arsenal and Manchester City both suffer serious dips down the final stretch, Klopp's final Anfield honours list will read: one Champions League, one Premier League, one FA Cup, two League Cups and a Club World Cup.\n\nThat is a very decent haul, yet not one which does full justice to the impact he has had on his club and on English football.\n\nAnd the timing of his exit announcement has not helped, as Ferguson would doubtless recognise.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_kidd@thesun.co.uk", "name":

This year marks a quarter of a century since Everton last celebrated a victory at Anfield in front of their fans.\n\nTheir only triumph at their old stomping ground in the past 25 years was a 2-0 win in a match held behind closed doors in February 2021. The last victory is arguably the most heated Merseyside derby in Premier League history.\n\nREAD MORE: Arne Slot nearing Liverpool appointment with negotiations on over Feyenoord compensation\n\nREAD MORE: 'I kept asking Liverpool manager if I could leave - but he did, and I found redemption'\n\nWatch football, F1, golf, tennis, cricket and more Get all the sport you could ever ask for\n\nSky Sports is bringing you 500 live football games to watch, as well access to Cricket, Golf, F1, Boxing, NFL, NBA and more across eight dedicated channels. Sky Sports is the only way to watch all the action this year.\n\n\u00a322 a month\n\nSky Get it here\n\nBack in September 1999, Kevin Campbell netted the sole goal in a game that saw three players sent off. Left-back Steve Staunton ended up in goal after Reds keeper Sander Westerveld and Toffees forward Francis Jeffers were shown red cards following a punch-up.\n\nHamann, meanwhile, was making his Merseyside derby debut that day, with manager Gerard Houllier boldly fielding the German despite him being out of action for seven weeks due to ruptured ankle ligaments sustained during his first appearance for the club on the opening day of the 1999/2000 season, reports the Liverpool Echo. In hindsight, it was a risky move that didn't quite pay off. Hamann was substituted just after the hour mark, with Steven Gerrard coming on to replace him, only to be sent off in extra time.\n\nHow do you think Everton vs Liverpool will play out? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nReflecting on the match, Hamann admits he should never have played against Everton that day 25 years ago, and only did so because Houllier asked him to. \"I had just come back from injury and the ankle still wasn't right,\" Hamann, courtesy of Free Bets, exclusively told the Liverpool Echo. \"I probably shouldn't have played, but the manager wanted me to play.\n\n\"But yeah, I probably shouldn't have played. I was taken off early and Stevie came on. It was quiet in the dressing room afterwards. The manager was never one for saying a lot after games.\n\nWatch the Champions League here Catch every minute of the Champions League 2023/2024\n\nTNT is the only place you can watch all the action from the Champions League this year.

Gerard always said, 'Talk about it tomorrow. It's gone now, we can't change it'. Obviously it was disappointing to lose that derby, but Everton were probably deserved winners. I was there a few years and don't think I lost too many after that so I got the first one out of the way early!\"\n\nHamann would win five of his 10 Merseyside derbies during his seven years at Anfield, losing just twice. Meanwhile, he was part of the Reds side that won four successive clashes at Goodison Park. While Klopp has only lost one of his 18 Merseyside derbies to date, Goodison victories have often eluded him in contrast to his compatriot.\n\nDespite only securing two victories from seven visits to Everton, former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann is sure the Reds can bag a win in their upcoming vital clash at Goodison Park.\"I think the games at Goodison are always a bit quicker than they are at Anfield because the atmosphere is really hostile,\" he shared, explaining his optimism about the Liverpool side under Jurgen Klopp. \"And the fact that Liverpool have been the more successful for a number of years. So yeah, you need resilience and cool heads.\"\n\nReiterating the home team's struggles, Hamann said: \"Everton are having a tough time at the moment but regardless of where they are in the league, it's never an easy place to go. It'll be the same on Wednesday night. But this team of Jurgen Klopp's, they've got through so many difficult situations and adversities. Obviously they know they have to win.\"\n\nAdding a dash of realism to the hopes, he stated: \"If they want to keep tabs with Man City, it probably helps if you win most games if not all the games. Even then, you're not guaranteed to win the league.\"\n\nSecuring his faith in the side, Hamann concluded: \"It's a huge game but I've got faith after the game against Fulham. They played well. Also Palace, I didn't think they actually did much wrong apart from scoring. On another day they probably would have got five or six. I've got every faith they get the result they need.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_staplehurst@dailystar.co.uk", "name":

We should have done better, and we didn't and that's why we lost,\" Klopp said.\n\nThe loss kept Liverpool three points behind league leaders Arsenal in second place and one ahead of defending champions Manchester City, who are in third and have two games in hand on both of the teams above.\n\nKlopp had spoken last week of needing perfection to win his second title at the club, but this was the latest setback for his team, who have lost two of their past three games in the league.\n\nWhile the result hurt Liverpool's title chances, it delivered a boost to Everton's survival bid, with the win moving Sean Dyche's team eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nThat fact seemed to be of less concern to the home fans, who were too busy reveling in the damage caused to Liverpool's season.\n\n\"You lost the league at Goodison Park,\" they chanted as the final whistle approached and the majority of the 39,000 crowd remained inside the stadium to drink in the atmosphere as the players celebrated on the field.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed. We let it happen exactly the game that Everton wanted,\" Klopp said.\n\nElsewhere, Manchester United survived another scare -- twice coming from behind to beat bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United 4-2.\n\nHaving been taken to the wire by second-tier Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday, Erik ten Hag's team looked in danger of dropping points in their bid to qualify for Europe.\n\nSheffield United led 1-0 and then 2-1 through goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton Diaz in each half at Old Trafford, but Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes from the penalty spot leveled on each occasion.\n\nFernandes put United ahead in the 81st minute and Rasmus Hojlund sealed the points four minutes later.\n\nUnited moved up to sixth in the Premier League standings, 13 points behind Aston Villa in fourth.\n\nCrystal Palace ensured top-flight safety after Jean-Philippe Mateta struck twice in a 2-0 win against Newcastle United.\n\nThey moved to 39 points, 14 clear of 18th-place Luton Town, who can only pick up a maximum of 37 if they win their final four games of the season.\n\nNewcastle dropped to seventh.\n\nAFC Bournemouth beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-0 at

We should have done better but we didn't.\"\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nFernandes to the rescue\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on Mar 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shootout win after blowing a three-goal lead against second-tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\n\"I think we played quite well, also creating many more chances. Many positives. But also negatives. Conceding two goals from giveaways. It's unacceptable. We want to play dynamic, attacking football,\" Ten Hag said.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nAttwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle.\n\nMateta broke the deadlock in the 55th minute and added the second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of qualifying for Europe.", "source": {"uri": "thephuketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Phuket News"}, "authors":

They were stung by goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, though, paying for some errant finishing of their own.\n\nDefending champions Manchester City sat a point adrift of the Reds, but with two games in hand on their rivals after Wednesday's action. The first of those comes against Brighton on Thursday, where a point would be enough to lift them above Liverpool.\n\nWith just weeks of the season to go, there's little margin of error for any of the sides in title contention. Liverpool's midweek defeat might indeed have ruled them out of contention entirely, as they now need both rivals to slip up.\n\nAll three contenders have matches against fifth-placed Tottenham to come, with Arsenal first to play Ange Postecoglou's side. There are also games which could impact the relegation battle and the fight for European qualification.\n\nArsenal have the advantage when it comes to goal difference, with their midweek win helping. With more games, though, City could yet close the gap in that regard.\n\nFor Liverpool, though, it will be tough to reel in their rivals with so little time remaining.

Liverpool now stand a 13.2% chance of winning the title, per Opta, while Manchester City leads the race at 56% with two games in hand.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he told broadcasters after the game about Liverpool's title chances. \"I can only apologize for today, to the people, everybody who's with us. I know how hard this is for us as well but for the people, it's especially hard. We should have done better. We didn't.\"\n\nKlopp admitted that Liverpool played right into Everton's hands, as Sean Dyche's team thrives on a lack of possession and capitalizes on set pieces. The outgoing Reds manager said the Toffees' play on set pieces was disruptive but also admitted his team did not step up when it came to defending or taking advantage of their 21 shots. He pointed specifically to the second half when Dominic Calvert-Lewin made it 2-0 to the hosts.\n\n\"Second half [was] emotional, we were in a rush, not really clear and then we conceded in the second half with a routine they do the whole season. We knew exactly the ball would end up there, we just didn't defend it,\" Klopp said. \"They had free kick after free kick. We had the ball, they earned the free kick. It's an important start of the story.\"\n\nThe manager was reluctant to say his team had run out of gas after a busy season in the Premier League, two domestic cup competitions and a run to the Europa League quarterfinals. He did little to defend the performance, though.\n\n\"We tried but at the end, it's not good enough,\" he said. \"There's nothing we can explain and if you win, you have 500 reasons and when you lose, it's just not good enough.\"\n\nHe also said the team intends to finish off the season -- and his impressive tenure in charge -- on a high, considering there are just four games remaining on the schedule.\n\n\"It's not the greatest moment we are in and we still have to play football games so we have to try to get through,\" he admitted. \"We have to use these moments to build, to get the momentum back.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pardeep_cattry@cbssports.com", "name": "Pardeep Cattry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_piece_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Set piece (football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/04/24/eb7acf63-13af-4bb4-9bfe-3cb66bd5e658/thumbnail/1200x675/32e95063c71d415aa0c3be95734e316b/klopp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

"body": "Liverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.\n\nWith Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.\n\nSecond-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.\n\nThird-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton on Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.\n\nIt hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February.\n\nBack then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.\n\nInstead, the end of Klopp's nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shoot win after blowing a three-goal lead against second tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\nThe Blades are 10 points from safety with only four games left as they sink towards relegation just one year after promotion from the Championship.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nIt was not spotted in real time but Attwell opted to give the foul following advice from VAR Darren England to watch it again on the pitchside monitor.\n\nMateta broke the deadlock at Selhurst Park with a smart 55th-minute finish before he added a second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of securing European football for next season.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

announcement spark Liverpool demise?", "body": "Jurgen Klopp may have inadvertently contributed to Liverpool's slump in form as a result of his leaving announcement.\n\nThat is the view of ex-Aston Villa striker Gabby Agbonlahor following the Reds' 2-0 Merseyside derby defeat to Everton at Goodison Park.\n\nAt the time of the German's announcement in January that he would be standing down at Anfield at the end of the season, Liverpool were five points clear.\n\nBut they now look set to miss out on a second Premier League title under Klopp, leading Agbonlahor to question whether it is the reason for the club's downfall.\n\nHe said on the talkSPORT Breakfast show: \"I remember us talking about it and we said it can go one of two ways.\n\n\"You either fight for your manager even more because you want him to leave with him winning the treble/double/quadruple they were in.\n\n\"But it's gone the opposite way, players have started to not look at it.\n\n\"I think even Trent [Alexander-Arnold] before they played in the Carabao Cup [final], he said, 'We want to win the quadruple, we want to go for four trophies.'\n\n\"Now the farewell tour of Jurgen Klopp is going to be one trophy and maybe finishing third in the league.\"\n\nLiverpool appeared to look galvanised following Klopp's announcement - winning the Carabao Cup with a depleted squad against a full-strength Chelsea team.\n\nAnd despite suffering a 3-1 defeat to Arsenal early on after Klopp's shock news, their form was formidable in all competitions.\n\nA hard-fought 1-1 draw with City in March gave fans hope that they could give their beloved boss the fairy tale send off he deserves.\n\nBut their season has slowly begun to unravel after they were knocked out of the FA Cup to rivals Manchester United in a seven-goal thriller the week after their 1-1 draw against the Citizens.\n\nLiverpool were on course to advance into the semi-finals, only to concede at the death, before succumbing to an Amad Diallo strike deep in extra-time stoppage time.\n\nGritty wins against Sheffield United and Brighton followed, before they once again left deflated at Old Trafford after drawing 2-2 against Erik ten Hag's side.\n\nIt was a result that tipped the balance in favour of Arsenal and City, and things then took a turn for the worse in the Europa League.\n\nSerie A side Atalanta silenced Anfield with a 3-0 victory, and while Liverpool emerged as 1-0 winners in the quarter-final second leg, it wasn't enough to keep them in Europe's second-tier competition.\n\nSandwiched between those matches against the Italian outfit was a 1-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace.\n\nThey were handed a get out of jail free card after Arsenal lost to Aston Villa hours later, but Liverpool's worrying form has continued.\n\nA nervy win at Fulham followed, before they were outfought at Everton to lose their first derby at Goodison Park since 2010.\n\nAnd with a tough trip to West Ham next for Liverpool, Klopp's farewell tour could turn into a nightmare ending.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_lambourne@talksport.com", "name":

And it's the engine room, or at the very least part of it, that will again need to be addressed in the coming transfer window.\n\nThat the meek surrender in the derby has prompted questions over Liverpool's lack of mental strength is somewhat harsh given they have won 27 points from losing positions this term and lifted the League Cup at Wembley in adverse circumstances. Hardly the sign of weak minds. But tired legs alone can't explain the manner in which, over the past four weeks, Liverpool have slipped out of the FA Cup, the Europa League and now, realistically, the title race.\n\nThere are of course other factors, such as the inevitable impact of Klopp leaving both on the manager himself and the squad. And the inexperience of certain players in coping with a high-octane derby at such a pressurised moment of the campaign was evident, most notably in the centre of the park.\n\nAs Everton swarmed in a manner akin to the 1990s Dogs of War, Liverpool lacked bite in midfield. Yes, Alexis Mac Allister leads by example and Curtis Jones attempted to get the Reds going, but neither they nor the disappointing Dominik Szoboszlai were able to rouse their team-mates in the same manner as Everton's feisty approach. It wasn't just the trio who were found wanting, though - across the pitch the Blues won 83% of their tackles (compared to 50% for Liverpool) and were easily on top in terms of duels, particularly during the pivotal opening half-hour.\n\nMuch is rightly made of the Reds' leadership group and they have an important part in the everyday work of the squad. But the current members are a different breed to former leaders Jordan Henderson and James Milner who, while not to the taste of everyone, could never be faulted for looking to impart motivation and ensure endeavour from their team-mates. Neither were afraid of putting a tackle in and revelled in the derby atmosphere, Henderson losing just one of 20 - and that was when he went off injured after half-an-hour - while Milner was unbeaten in 13.\n\nThat Klopp attempted to sign Moises Caicedo last summer underlines he recognised the need for a strong, athletic defensive midfield enforcer last summer. Wataru Endo, to whom Liverpool instead turned, has many of those attributes and in retrospect should have started against Everton, but was never bought with the long term in mind. And, with Endo unable to play every game, Mac Allister has spent the majority of the season filling in, in the process unable to operate in the more advanced role in which he has already shown he revels.\n\nYes, Stefan Bajectic is a future prospect, but he has made only six career Premier League starts and will take time to reintegrate having missed almost all of the last 13 months due to fitness issues. Like Endo, he will have a role to play next season, but there needs to be greater competition in the position.\n\nLiverpool's next manager, then, will this summer find himself in exactly the same place as Klopp 12 months previous. Recruiting the right number six could be key to dragging the Reds further into the conversation with Arsenal and Manchester City next season.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_doyle@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Ian Doyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_International_Match_Calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA International Match Calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Milner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Milner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Caicedo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felipe Caicedo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29061652.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2149430152.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

"title": "Reds' title dream in ruins in bruising derby defeat; Man Utd's wild scare from minnows: PL Wrap", "body": "Liverpool's Premier League title bid suffered a devastating blow in a 2-0 defeat at Merseyside rivals Everton, while Manchester United spared Erik ten Hag's blushes with a 4-2 victory against lowly Sheffield United on Wednesday.\n\nJurgen Klopp's side were beaten at Goodison Park for the first time in 14 years in a brutal setback to their hopes of catching leaders Arsenal.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put Everton ahead in the 27th minute as the defender prodded the ball under Liverpool keeper Alisson Becker via the post after the Reds made a hash of clearing a free-kick.\n\nWith Liverpool's Mohamed Salah once again struggling to convert chances to equalise, Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin delivered the knockout punch with a 58th-minute header.\n\nSecond-placed Liverpool remain three points behind Arsenal, who have a vastly superior goal difference, with both sides having four games left.\n\nThird-placed Manchester City, who visit Brighton on Saturday, will be crowned English champions for an unprecedented fourth successive season if they win their last six matches.\n\nLiverpool have reportedly opened talks with Feyenoord's Arne Slot to take over from Klopp, whose long goodbye looks set to end with a whimper.\n\nIt hardly the scenario Klopp envisioned when Liverpool beat Chelsea in the League Cup final in February.\n\nBack then, his team were in contention for a quadruple that would have capped his final season in spectacular fashion.\n\nInstead, the end of Klopp's nine-year reign is becoming a damp squib, with Liverpool knocked out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Manchester United and losing to Atalanta at the same stage of the Europa League as their title challenge evaporates.\n\nAt Old Trafford, Ten Hag's side twice trailed to the league's bottom club before Bruno Fernandes came to his beleaguered manager's aid in the second half.\n\nJayden Bogle put the Blades ahead and although Harry Maguire equalised before half-time, Ben Brereton Diaz restored the visitors' advantage soon after the interval.\n\nFernandes bailed out Ten Hag with a penalty equaliser before the Portugal midfielder's long-range rocket put United in front with nine minutes left.\n\nRasmus Hojlund got United's fourth to ensure they could finally enjoy a first league win in five games since beating Everton on March 9.\n\nIt was a temporary reprieve for Ten Hag, who hopes to salvage sixth-placed United's dismal season by winning the FA Cup and finishing high enough to qualify for the Europa League.\n\nTen Hag endured stinging criticism after United stumbled into the FA Cup final with a spluttering penalty-shoot win after blowing a three-goal lead against second tier Coventry on Sunday.\n\nThe Blades are 10 points from safety with only four games left as they sink towards relegation just one year after promotion from the Championship.\n\nReferee Stuart Attwell was embroiled in further controversy after contentiously disallowing a Wolves goal in Bournemouth's 1-0 win at Molineux.\n\nAttwell was already in the spotlight for his role as VAR in denying Nottingham Forest three penalties in Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Everton, which led Forest to insinuate bias as he supports relegation rivals Luton.\n\nThis time, he adjudged Matheus Cunha to have fouled Justin Kluivert in an off-the-ball incident in the build up to Hwang Hee-chan's second-half equaliser, which looked to have cancelled out Antoine Semenyo's opener.\n\nIt was not spotted in real time but Attwell opted to give the foul following advice from VAR Darren England to watch it again on the pitchside monitor.\n\nAttwell remained in the thick of the action as he showed a straight red card to Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez for a foul on Matt Doherty.\n\nPALACE FIRE AGAIN\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta scored for a fifth consecutive home match to fire Crystal Palace to a 2-0 win over Newcastle.\n\nMateta broke the deadlock at Selhurst Park with a smart 55th-minute finish before he added a second late on to end Newcastle's four-match unbeaten run and damage their prospects of securing European football for next season.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The result leaves Liverpool with 74 points, three points behind Arsenal, with four games left to play, and a point above Manchester City, who has played two games less and faces Brighton on Thursday, reported Xinhua. Premier League 2023-24: Liverpool Open Negotiations With Feyenoord for Arne Slot As Jurgen Klopp's Replacement.\n\nEverton deserved the win that lifts them eight points above the relegation zone, with Jarrad Branthwaite scoring their first goal midway through the first half, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin took advantage of some poor defending to score their second following a second-half corner. It is only Everton's second win against their neighbors in 27 Liverpool derbies.\n\nManchester United twice came back from behind to win 4-2 at home to Sheffield United and moves into sixth place. Sheffield went ahead two times at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Jayden Bogle and Ben Brereton, but was pegged back by Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes. A second goal from Fernandes with just nine minutes left put United ahead, and Rasmus Hojlund assured the win with five minutes left to play.\n\nNewcastle United failed to keep pace with Erik ten Hag's side as Crystal Palace continued their excellent form under Oliver Glasner to win 2-0 thanks to two second-half goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta. Crystal Palace is now mathematically safe from relegation, while Newcastle has dropped to three points behind Manchester United.\n\nWednesday's final game saw Antoine Semenyo score the only goal of the game as Bournemouth won 1-0 away to Wolverhampton Wanderers, with the visitors hanging on for a win after Milos Kerkez's 79th-minute sending off.

Everton come into this on the back of their 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest, while Liverpool won 3-1 at Fulham on Sunday.\n\nI'm expecting the Reds to get the job done and their quality should shine through. I'm on Liverpool to Win but I'm expecting it to be tight and I like the look of Both Teams To Score.\n\nBoth teams have netted in six of Liverpool's last nine outings in all competitions and I'm expecting that trend to continue on Wednesday!\n\nI'm also on Mohamed Salah to Score. The Egyptian was rested against Fulham and he'll start against Everton. He's battling to win the Golden Boot so he'll be shoot on sight as usual.\n\nDon't forget about our new Super Sub offer where if you back a player in certain markets, if they're substituted their picks transfer over to who they've been replaced by. Read more about Paddy Power's Super Sub offer here.\n\nFinally, I'm backing a couple of players to have an effort on goal.\n\nFirst up is Darwin Nunez to Have One or More Shots on Target. Like Salah, the forward was rested against Fulham and he'll be raring to go against Liverpool's arch rivals. Nunez averages over three shots per game in the Premier League and he'll get one of those on target.\n\nLast up is Dominic Calvert-Lewin to Have One or More Shots on Target. The striker has netted six times in all competitions this season and he averages over two shots per game in the league. He's scored in two of his last three and he'll be hopeful of adding to his tally against Liverpool.\n\nAll prices are bang up to date with our snazzy widgets, while odds in copy are accurate at time of publishing but subject to change.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nTHE PADDY POWER GUIDE TO SAFER GAMBLING - EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW", "source": {"uri": "news.paddypower.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddy Power News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_thompson@news.paddypower.com", "name": "Phil Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.\u2013Manchester_United_F.C._rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C.\u2013Manchester United F.C. rivalry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/news.paddypower.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/Phil-Thompson-Liverpool-v-Everton.png?fit=991%2C624&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Plus: Outrageous Mbappe nutmeg", "body": "The Athletic FC \u26bd This is The Athletic's daily football/soccer newsletter. Sign up here to receive it directly in your inbox.\n\nHello! You know what they say. Don't cry because it's ending. Smile because it happened.\n\nAll good things are destined to end. Like Jurgen Klopp's record at Goodison Park. Like Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool.\n\nTrue, Liverpool aren't finished. Not mathematically. It's three points to the top of the Premier League table, or four if we factor in Arsenal's goal difference.\n\nBut losing away at Everton -- their Merseyside rivals who took a step closer to survival -- last night, the derby Klopp had never lost at Goodison in all his time, is probably the end for him. He knows it, and so do Liverpool.\n\nWere the title a two-horse race, he could pray for salvation. But Arsenal and Manchester City -- who are a point behind Klopp's side with two games in hand -- both imploding in the few games that are left? We're somewhere between no chance and none.\n\nHow quickly this turned -- from a near flawless run of results to a chaotic FA Cup defeat to Manchester United in mid-March which provoked a chain of negative reactions.\n\nKlopp said he was resigning because he was weary. Liverpool, in tandem and as a project, have begun to look weary too. And suddenly in need of the reset that's coming their way.\n\nTwo post-match comments at Goodison jumped out at me. The first was Klopp describing Liverpool's counter-pressing as \"horrible\". That's an indictment of one of their biggest strengths under him.\n\nThe second was Virgil van Dijk questioning whether Liverpool \"really want to win the league\". Which was him on the verge of saying no -- and conceding that they won't.\n\nFrom the moment Klopp announced he would resign at the end of the season, this became his version of 'The Last Dance', that immense documentary about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. The month behind Klopp has been more like Netflix's Tour De France series: an elite rider broken by a Hors Categorie climb.\n\nKlopp's record as he prepares to bow out: seven major trophies in nine years, including a Premier League and a Champions League. Understanding him as we do, he'd have wanted more.\n\nBut he had the misfortune of coming up against a Manchester City team beyond compare and despite that, he took Liverpool back to the top table. Anfield's love has been well earned.\n\nPerhaps there is an upside to Liverpool's downturn.\n\nKlopp no longer looks like an impossible void to fill. Liverpool no longer look like they are losing a coach at his absolute peak. His expressions of fatigue sound honest, and they're reflected in his body language.\n\nPerhaps, on reflection, a new broom is just the ticket.\n\nLiverpool are fishing for Feyenood's Arne Slot. They got nowhere with a first offer of just under \u00a38m ($10m) but last night's defeat will only deepen their resolve in negotiations.\n\nUntil very recently, replacing Klopp resembled a hospital pass. As it is, and as James Pearce writes, a rebuild is now much easier to embrace. It's been some ride for Liverpool. But nothing lasts forever.\n\nThoughts and prayers with Nathaniel Adjei. There he was, minding his own business with Lorient in France, when Kylian Mbappe made his name go viral.\n\nYou might remember the piece we did recently on the Chigwada spin: a mad bit of skill by Manchester City youngster David Chigwada. Watch it 10 times and you still won't be sure exactly how he pulled it off.\n\nMbappe does tricks like that in his sleep and here he is destroying Adjei with a brutal nutmeg (more on the art of the nutmeg here) in Paris St-Germain's 4-1 win at Lorient last night. I hate to say it but Adjei, who's only 21, might just have experienced the most high-profile moment of his career.\n\n(Video is here for readers in U.S)\n\nFrom the vaults of the unexpected -- Xavi is staying on as Barcelona manager next season.\n\nWhy unexpected? Because he announced that he was quitting a while back and has given the impression of being thoroughly sick of life at Camp Nou, calling it a 'cruel job'. Ever heard of the Barca entorno?\n\nNot only that, in the past week Barca have dropped out of the running in La Liga and the Champions League. But an emergency meeting with president Joan Laporta turned everything on its head. We're expecting a formal announcement today.\n\nThis got me thinking. If U-turns are in vogue, any chance that Bayern Munich go into reverse gear with Thomas Tuchel?\n\nIf you don't know who the Championship's player-of-the-year is then really, you should.\n\nI've written about the making of him, along with Nancy Frostick, and his trademark goal -- cutting in off the wing, teeing the ball up and curling it deftly inside the far corner.

perfect 10 in famous Liverpool victory", "body": "A superb display gave Everton their first Merseyside Derby on home turf since October 2010 as they beat Liverpool 2-0.\n\nBlues fans mocked their neighbours by chanting \"you lost the league at Goodison Park\" after goals from Jarrad Branthwaite and Dominic Calvert-Lewin either side of the break gave Sean Dyche's side a richly-deserved three points to hand defeat to Jurgen Klopp on his last trip across Stanley Park.\n\nAnd here is how we rated the Everton players at a magical night at Goodison...\n\nLIVE UPDATES: All the reaction as Everton beat Liverpool 2-0 at Goodison Park\n\nJordan Pickford 10\n\nSuperb cool showing under pressure, he made a couple of smart saves with his legs to deny Nunez and Diaz then a low block to keep out Robertson then after the break he tipped over the bar to deny Elliott and palmed away a stoppage time effort from Salah.\n\nBen Godfrey 9\n\nOne of his most-impressive ever displays at full-back, he made some crucial interceptions, most notably to meet a Salah cross before Nunez and then put a big challenge in on the Uruguayan while going close with a back post header then went wide.\n\nVitalii Mykolenko 9\n\nCarried on from his impressive marshalling of Mohamed Salah at Anfield by keeping Liverpool's main danger man quiet but picked up an injury late in the first half and was withdrawn at the interval and while eagle-eyed readers might note he 'only' had an 8 at that point, he has to be bumped up with everyone else.\n\nJames Tarkowski 9\n\nColossal display from the captain, making a string of well-timed interceptions and cool clearances under pressure, throwing his body at the ball on numerous occasions.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite 10\n\nEtched himself into Merseyside Derby folklore to take this impressive breakthrough season for him to another level, the young centre-back, who has already netted against Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton & Hove Albion this calendar year, grabbed by far his most-significant goal so far with a cool, low finish that was too hot for Alisson to handle and was also assured at the back.\n\nIdrissa Gueye 9\n\nRan himself into the ground for 75 minutes with another all-action display in the engine room from one of Sunday's heroes, he was everywhere, doing what he does best.\n\nJames Garner 9\n\nIn for Andre Gomes, the young Merseysider brought some added bite and energy in the middle for the derby battle to unsettle Liverpool's title challengers.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucoure 9\n\nRan his heart out and was always an option for his team-mates in the thick of the action with his athleticism while playing it smart.\n\nJack Harrison 9\n\nIndustrious in both attack and defence, he played a delightful ball through to Calvert-Lewin for the penalty that was overturned by VAR and put in a heck of a shift down the right flank.\n\nDwight McNeil 9\n\nA threat with his set-piece deliveries as shown by his inch-perfect in-swinging corner-kick to find Calvert Lewin for the second goal, he'd earlier tested Alisson from distance and often took a touch just to calm things down and spray a pass when surrounded by chaos.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin 10\n\nTerrific far post header at the Gwladys Street End to double Everton's lead after being denied from close range by Alisson in the first half, having been chopped down by the Brazilian for the penalty that never was.\n\nAshley Young (on 46 for Mykolenko) 9\n\nPut his disastrous derby debut at Anfield behind him with a solid showing after Everton's only recognised left-back was forced off.\n\nAmadou Onana (on 75 for Gueye) 9\n\nIntelligent and composed display in the latter stages.\n\nYoussef Chermiti (on 90 for Calvert-Lewin)\n\nThe teenager came on in stoppage team to enable Everton's number nine to be given a standing ovation as he made way.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors":

I am delighted for Evertonians, for the old school Toffees who support us.

He urged supporters to acknowledge work still needed to be done to address Everton's wider issues but added: \"There is still loads to go but the last two games have been a real forceful show of a reaction of a group when the noise changes - 'you don't care?' - of course we care, of course we care, how can you do my job and not care, it is impossible.\n\n\"For my staff and the players, it is impossible not to care.

Everything and anything is going wrong for Liverpool.\n\nThat was proven when Everton won the Merseyside derby 2-0 on Wednesday night at Goodison Park to really stick the knife in when it comes to winning the Premier League.\n\nAt one point, this Liverpool side was pushing to win four trophies - The League Cup, FA Cup, Europa League and Premier League title.\n\nYet, fast forward to the present, and it's highly likely that Klopp will walk out of the door at the end of the campaign with only one trophy in hand.\n\nIt's all, understandably so, very deflating for supporters and many are questioning what has gone wrong. And where has it gone wrong?\n\nSteve Nicol was pretty clear that it has 'fallen apart' and he decided to look towards the forward players, as he told ESPN.\n\nThe legendary defender singled out Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez - the duo had games to forget against Everton and, once again, played like they had rollerskates on.\n\nBefore the turn of the year, nearly everything was going right for the attacking duo, but now Nicol thinks they have 'disappeared off the face of the earth'.\n\n\"Mostly, in my opinion, it fell apart because, for some reason, the front players, particularly Salah and Nunez, have absolutely disappeared off the face of the earth,\" said Nicol.\n\n\"We saw Nunez with a chance in the highlight. What we didn't see was there was ball, he was standing at the top of the box, on his own, there was a ball fired into him.

He actually ended up salvaging it and putting it back to Mo Salah, who then put it 40 yards over the crossbar. That little passage just summed up what Liverpool have been going forward.\"\n\nThe Reds can now wave goodbye to any chance of becoming champions of England again.\n\nArsenal are leading the pack and they are three points clear of Liverpool and with a far better goal difference.\n\nWith Manchester City only one point behind Mikel Arteta's men, but they have two games in hand.\n\nWith very few games remaining, not even a miracle would create the scenario of both Arsenal and Man City dropping points now because that's what Klopp and his players need.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amir_mir@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Amir Mir", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nicol", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nicol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2024/04/GettyImages-2150035152-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

I was watching it go over the line slowly and saw Dom slide in... but yeah, it's a good feeling and buzzing to get the win.\n\nREAD MORE: What Sean Dyche told Dominic Calvert-Lewin after 'loving' Everton sign\n\nREAD MORE: What Everton supporters chanted in injury time sums up feeling as Goodison Park gets what it deserves\n\n\"I just hit it. It wasn't the best finish and he nearly saved it, but they all count. You've got to be in the right place and keep it low.\"\n\nThe goal was the 21-year-old's third this calendar year but Calvert-Lewin sealed the victory with his 53rd Premier League goal for the club. Branthwaite said: \"I've said all season that we know the quality Dom has got, and once he gets that confidence he's going to score goals. The way he played tonight, his overall game, was just brilliant. A proper No 9 performance and buzzing for him.\n\n\"It's another step in the right direction but nothing is done yet. We'll focus on the next game and try to keep picking up points between now and the end of the season.\"\n\nBranthwaite also saluted the contribution made by the Everton fans inside Goodison Park. He said: \"They're top and are going to push us over the line until the end. It's a privilege to play in front of them and the support they show us is massive.\"\n\nBranthwaite was pleased with how the team - who have now won back-to-back home games by 2-0 margins - have responded to the embarrassment of their display at Stamford Bridge. He added: \"I said after Chelsea it was about how we react to that. It was a disappointing night. Everyone was disappointed. How we've reacted after such a bad result shows the mentality of the team.\n\n\"It was just about the standards we set from the start of the season. When you look at that game, it wasn't good enough. We all realised that. It was about how we rectify that and bouncing back, which we have done.\"\n\nAlthough Everton's top flight status would now be secure with 41 points if they hadn't suffered their two deductions, Branthwaite refused to acknowledge that this victory ensured that Sean Dyche's side are safe. When asked if he felt the result would do that, he said: \"Nah, anything can happen in the Premier League, teams can pick up points when you least expect it. We need to focus on ourselves and take every game as it comes, focus on what we can do to keep ourselves safe.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_beesley@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Chris Beesley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29056682.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2150022901.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Mind you, given how that trio underperformed, they should have been among the last berating a misplaced pass.\n\nBack on the boos\n\nEverton fans were understandably rather pleased with how matters were going at Goodison, and they didn't miss a trick in reminding the away end of the fact.\n\nThe Liverpool followers were pretty quiet during the second half, prompting some in the home section to chant forcibly that their level of support was, to put it kindly, somewhat sub-standard.\n\nThat, though, merely led to the travelling Kop breaking out into a chorus of boos, which many of them regard to be a regular feature among Everton fans at Goodison in recent years. Not on Wednesday, however.\n\nBad maths\n\nThere was a funny moment in the press box after the game as the members of the media rattled out their prose as their respective deadlines approached.\n\n\"Keep on writing, guys, keep on writing, we win one of these every year!\" exclaimed one delighted departing Everton fan, who then pondered for a second and corrected himself by declaring: \"Well, one every 25 years.\"\n\nLiverpool's ability to avoid defeat at Goodison hasn't been quite that extensive.

Despite playing for side who, even without the points deduction, would be in the bottom half of the table, for months now Jarrad Branthwaite has been bossing the division's top strikers.\n\nOf late though, he's also started to show himself as quite an accomplished finisher, too. While his first of the season, a last-gasp headed equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur, was all about bravery, his strike at Brighton & Hove Albion was as composed as any leading marksman and in the heat of battle against Liverpool, Branthwaite was cool as a cucumber here, etching himself into Merseyside Derby folklore.\n\nREAD MORE: What Everton supporters chanted in injury time sums up feeling as Goodison Park gets what it deserves\n\nREAD MORE: Everton player ratings as three score perfect 10 in famous Liverpool victory\n\nEverton's number nine\n\nFrom the days of Dixie Dean, football's first player to don the famous shirt, Evertonians have always loved their number nines and Dominic Calvert-Lewin put all those tough days behind him with a header from a corner-kick in front of the Gwladys Street reminiscent of Duncan Ferguson's fabled Merseyside derby goal almost three decades ago.\n\nAlong with the Blues' iconic Tartan talisman, who had two spells at Goodison Park, Calvert-Lewin is one of just four players to have broken the 50-goal barrier in the Premier League for the club (Romelu Lukaku and Tim Cahill being the others). Although the striker reached that milestone back in October when he struck the winner at West Ham United, a lengthy - and unfortunate given efforts home and away against Tottenham Hotspur were taken off him - barren streak followed for him.\n\nIt was a sign of Calvert-Lewin's fluctuating fortunes, and the work done by Sean Dyche and his staff to get him properly fit again after a couple of seasons of injury woes, that his drought lasted for more matches than he'd even played in the previous two campaigns but he's certainly back now. It wasn't quite as spectacular as the diving header at the same end to complete the 3-2 comeback win over Crystal Palace on that desperate night almost two years ago on the night that Everton secured Premier League victory but in its own way, was celebrated equally enthusiastically.\n\nTracksuit manager\n\nAhead of this hat-trick of home games, Dyche revealed to Geoff Shreeves that he decided to wear a shirt and tie on matchdays after his former Watford boss Aidy Boothroyd had been ignored by a referee because he didn't stand out from the rest of his staff because of their identical training gear.\n\nWhether it's Nottingham Forest on a Sunday afternoon or Liverpool on a Wednesday night though, the feel of 'dress down Fridays' might be here to stay for a little while longer for the Everton gaffer. Dyche himself made light of the interest in his new, more relaxed look but this was a display as smart as they come.\n\nBeating a relegation rival at the weekend was one thing but defeating your local rivals - who are challenging for the Premier League title - takes things on to a much higher level and arguably eclipses the 1-0 victory over Arsenal in his first match or even the spectacular 5-1 thrashing of Brighton & Hove Albion last term that shifted the feel of the fight to stay in the division as the outstanding performance of Dyche's reign to date. Still smarting after being hit for six by Chelsea, some Evertonians were calling for the head of this eighth manager in as many years last week but while the great Carlo Ancelotti won behind closed doors at Anfield, Dyche has just succeeded where Roberto Martinez, Ronald Koeman, Sam Allardyce, Marco Silva, Rafael Benitez and Frank Lampard all failed by beating Jurgen Klopp in front of a crowd.",

And some advice for Arne Slot.\n\nSend your views on all subjects - including Man City after the Brighton game - to theeditor@football365.com\n\nWhy is anybody laughing at Liverpool?\n\nYes, let's all laugh at Liverpool as 99% of fans want them to fail.\n\nI don't. My impression of Liverpool fans has been formed by them applauding us off the field after losing the title in the most heartbreaking way possible in 1989 and clapping gooners in the Clock for joining in with a Justice for the 96 chant.\n\nSome of you may not think this matters but when City win the league next month, that will be four in a row.\n\nThe way Guardiola was talking about fixture pile-ups was symptomatic of what the Premier League has become - a farmer's league.\n\nAnd Pep knows all about competing in those having come over from Bayern.\n\nCity win the title every season so why not ease the pressure on them so they can have a cakewalk defending the Champions League trophy as standard bearers for the Premier League?\n\nBut people don't tend to cheer on rival English teams in Europe as they once did. One of my favourite football memories was Barca knocking out Chelsea in the Champions League and the entire pub - including me and my Spurs supporting mate - laughing a Blues fan out of the pub as he departed saying, 'I thought this was England'.\n\nSo yeah, laugh at Liverpool all you want. But next season, Klopp's gone which means if Arteta can't stop them, City will win five in a row and the journey towards a farmer's league will be complete.\n\nGraham Simons, Gooner, Norf London\n\nLaughing here...\n\nI wrote in last week, stating Liverpool had been riding their luck for most of the season (a fact, as Benitez would say!), & Liverpool fan derided me, & some wondered why Spurs fans like me, hate Liverpool.\n\nI got news for you, everyone (except for you deluded & entitled lot) hates Liverpool, because everything \"means more\" to you , because opposition never get any credit for beating you, its all about Liverpool's missed chances, how they should've won the game easily etc. etc.\n\nFinally, credit to Man Utd, in a shambolic season, they did the country a huge favour by beating Liverpool in that classic FA cup semi (deservedly so, even though they got zero credit, it was all about how Liverpool should've won easily), which started the glorious decline. Liverpool have just not been the same team since, never recovered from that fatal blow.\n\nFred (\"We all hate Liverpool & their entitled fans\"), London\n\nLiverpool fans are playing a different tune...\n\nWell well well, how the turntables... Not so long ago the mailbox was filled with Klopp acolytes praising the German for building a second great Liverpool team and leaving the club in rude health for his successor. It was argued by those cultists how this made him superior even to Fergie despite the Scot walking away from a title winning side after building like five of them. Nunez, Jones, Robertson, Konate, Trent, Szoboslai, Van Dijk, even Salah deemed not good enough, \"a true mess from top to bottom\" apparently. What lovely irony.\n\nWhilst we're on the subject of over indulged teams and their failing managers, how is Howe not under the microscope? There was some talk earlier in the season of him being replaced but with Chelsea and United's respective shit shows taking all the headlines the toon have been seemingly spared similar scrutiny. They have no excuse the other sides can't also bemoan and are sleepwalking into a limp season finish. With talk of selling their stars this summer and weakening that squad, is Eddie still the right man for the job?\n\nDave, Manchester\n\n...As a Liverpool supporter - yes, you Scott, Toronto - how entitled must you be to say your club is 'a true mess from top to bottom'? A long time ago, I used to enjoy the footie phone-ins, comments under articles and this Mailbox, now it just seems as if the world is full of Scotts. Not a world I want to inhabit.\n\nG Thomas, Breda\n\n...Well, following on from the last Mailbox, I suspect that every trite Liverpool email that has YNWA in it, should now be updated to FWSA.\n\nFair Weather Supporters Association.\n\nYou're a disgrace. What kind of 'support' is that? I'll tell you what kind, exactly the kind of support I always suspected it is/was...\n\nReal Liverpool fans want a word..\n\nI am way too busy to be writing this, but Christ, the state of the mailbox this morning, Before the season began, no-one had Liverpool down to do anything of note this season. Had anyone offered me a cup (yes, even the League Cup) and a top four spot (not 100% guaranteed but it would take a very strange four weeks for this not to happen), I would have snatched their entire arm off.\n\nYes, it's a disappointing and underwhelming end to Klopp's tenure, but the first 80% of the season was an absolute blast. The entitlement dripping out of the pores of the absolute weapons that were published today is just appalling.\n\n...Between the Liverpool Supporters Whatsapp group and the reactions in the mailbox, I honestly think Liverpool fans have lost all perspective on this season. When I saw all the talk of quadruples and winning the league one more time for Klopp I felt very uneasy, especially as we were 'getting away with it' when giving teams a goal start against us and somehow turning it around, only so many times you can do that throughout a season.\n\nIf you look at what happened at the start of the season where we had to buy in a whole new midfield, and then cope with a bunch of injuries, we have completely overachieved this season. What other team in the top three has had open heart surgery on their midfield, an area that was crucial to Klopp's way of playing since he came in? Jamie Carragher voiced a lot of these opinions last night and was pretty measured given the emotions he must have been feeling.\n\nI think Champions League qualification and a Cup is progress this season after the poor season we had last season. Yes, frustrating we were in the lead for so long, but I think deep down we knew it wasn't sustainable and Arsenal and City were going to go on a run.\n\nIn saying that, I think over the last few games it highlights we are too predictable and we don't or can't vary our play enough to trouble teams that set up to stifle us. There's only so much running and pressing you can do in a game, we also need to be able to play football and control a game, something we've not done all season.\n\nI've heard good things about Slot and if he's to be the new manager we need to get behind him.\n\nI also think there needs to be some ruthless decisions made over the summer as I think some players have got into their comfort zone. I think the sensible thing is to cash in on Salah, and use the money to reinvest in another striker capable of scoring off fewer chances. Nunez has had his chances, he isn't good enough, so cut our losses and get a replacement.\n\nI think we just need to make the call now and move Trent into midfield and have Bradley at RB next season. Robertson has been hit and miss this season, he needs proper competition at left back. Konate is too erratic and I think we need to invest in a top-quality CB this summer, to play with and eventually replace VVD. I think Edwards and Hughes will make decisions based purely on numbers and no emotion will be involved like we had previously with giving extended contracts to Henderson etc.\n\nMy last point is on leadership, it's non-existent at the moment. VVD isn't a captain, he's not intense enough. Salah is supposed to be a senior player, leadership team and so on, but I just don't see it.\n\nSlot has a decent base to work from but also needs to make some early calls that might be unpopular.\n\nJohn LFC, Wexford\n\nCongratulations to Everton for a commendable performance, winning the physical battle.\n\nI'm honestly glad that your Prem status is all but assured - a fine response to the extra challenge the authorities decided to throw your way. My footballing enjoyment is all the higher for our encounters.\n\nThanks to Diaz for the 90 minutes of effort you displayed - a shining example to others which they frankly failed to emulate.\n\nTo Nunez and Salah, your sessions at the Stevie Wonder school of finishing are doing us no favours.\n\nTo the Liverpool coach entrusted with coaching the defence of aerial set pieces, do your job better .. but in all honesty the players needed to show more fight and desire to win the ball.\n\nBut to you Jurgen, thank you ... thank you for helping to create and lead a group of players who have challenged, but ultimately come up just short this season.\n\nThe way you touched the club badge in the tunnel when managing Dortmund in a pre-season game over a decade ago ... the jolt of footballing adrenalin I got from watching your first press conference when announced as Liverpool manager .... for bringing back the belief, the big trophies ... for being one of the most treasured, charismatic individuals to walk into the broader sphere of my life. Thank you.\n\nEnd of an era\n\nAfter last night's performance and defeat at Everton I have reflected on everything that is happening at Liverpool. Now our season has pretty much ended, it feels quite deflating it has fallen apart over the last month or so when it looked like we were in for an exciting end to the season.\n\nAfter last season's low, if I was told we would finish 3rd in the League and win a trophy, I would have been very happy with that. Add in Jurgen's departure, and now it feels like a missed opportunity to add another trophy to his collection. Since Jurgen's announcement he is leaving, I have now reached acceptance stage. Maybe he is right to leave now, that his cycle as manager is coming to it's natural conclusion.\n\nDoesn't mean I am happy about it. Rival fans point and say Jurgen should have won more. I'd rather look back and remember everything he has done, and for me, it has been an amazing journey with so many enjoyable moments. It's been a ride I'm delighted to have witnessed and thank Jurgen for the memories.\n\nWhat comes next? Rumours of who is next manager keep changing, but at the moment it looks like that man will be Arne Slot. Rival fans are already writing him off as another ETH type flop. Which is lazy stereotyping. Do I know much about him, or what he has achieved with Feyenoord? No I don't. Winning a league last season and a cup this season with Feyenoord feels like a pretty good achievement, as I don't really know how big a club they are outside of Ajax and PSV.\n\nFrom what I have read, Arne likes to play attacking football and gives young players a chance. Which sounds promising, on paper. As we reach unknown times, it will be a mixture of optimism and scepticism going through the summer and into next season. It will most likely also be the end of the cycle for some of the players. Salah and Virgil feel like they have reached the end of their Liverpool journeys as well.\n\nWhatever happens, I will still take enjoyment from watching Liverpool play football. That will never change.\n\nKevin\n\nThat was just predictable from Liverpool\n\nLiverpool's fall from grace has been quite interesting and frustrating to watch.\n\nPersonally I didn't make much of it because the chances were always there. Against United in the FA Cup, we should've been out of sight. Losing that was ridiculous. Same against United in the PL.\n\nAgainst Crystal Palace, you have to admire their tenacity and work rate however that does not exist without them scoring first, and one of those clear-cut chances should've gone in. The fact that it wasn't just Nunez but Salah and Jota missing made it somehow worse.\n\nThe same could be said about the game yesterday. Any of those chances go in for 1-1 it's a different game (and again Salah, Nunez and Diaz made it 3 different culprits) but there has been a knack for Liverpool to give opponents hope and that puts us in the mess we find ourselves in.\n\nVan Dijk's post match comments made me think about Klopp's comments when he announced his leaving. The exhaustion that he spoke about, seems to be present in this Liverpool team too. At the moment, they are huffing and puffing and should be leading and winning games but just don't seem to be able to get there. After a while the steam runs out and we get that turd of a performance in the second half last night.\n\nFurther to that, one mailboxer pointed out Liverpool's Luck has run out and now I see what he meant. Not only do we seem to gift opposition goals and opportunities to boost their self belief, but we are also not getting similar treatment. off the top of my head: Van Dijk/Allison against Arsenal, Quansah against United in the Prem, Nunez against United in the Cup. But I do not recall an opposition mistake in recent months that gave us the mental boost needed to push on.\n\nAll in all, I am grateful for having had the last 8.5 years with Klopp. He changed the club, and gave us a fun era to remember fondly even though he didn't win as much as he probably should have. But, I have reached the acceptance stage of grief, where a new Manager (whoever), will start a new era. one that is perhaps not as fun and engaging as this one has been, but one that is definitely not going to be as exhausting and mentally draining. Vielen Dank J\u00fcrgen Klopp, you will never be forgotten.\n\nNik (didn't even get mad last night, just sighed repeatedly as events progressed), Paris\n\nREAD: Liverpool limp from title race as Jurgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah run out of road\n\n...Surely it's obvious to anyone with half a brain that Liverpool are failing at the end since it ties in perfectly with Klopp leaving. All teams are a reflection of their manager on the pitch right? Usually that is said about the good ones anyways. This was always said about Fergie, Wenger, Jose. If Klopp is regarded in the same level as these then that is what is happening.\n\nThe man has said he doesn't have the energy to do it anymore. Guess what... then the team is going to start looking listless and sapped of energy. He doesn't have the same bounce in him anymore, neither to the players that follow him. All this has started to happen more and more since he announced he is leaving. This also happens to 90% of teams when a manager announces retirement or finishing up, and it happens across multiple sports. It's not a unique thing that's happening.\n\nSo take all that and stick it in your bottles. This is what's happening. Trust me.\n\nCulk the Younger\n\nWhy does it hurt so bad?\n\nIt shouldn't hurt as much. As a man in his mid-Fifties I have much more important things going on in my life than Liverpool losing last night, but this morning I don't.\n\nMy first thoughts when I woke this morning were all back to last night's game and how the hell we lost to Everton. I mean, bleedin' Everton!!!!\n\nThose feelings were anger mostly, then sadness at Liverpool's season falling away with a whimper.\n\nThe way I feel this morning reminds me of Shankly's (often misquoted) quote about football being more important than...well you know the rest.\n\nBig old Palace relief\n\nIs it fair to say that F365 are not slightly more at ease now thanks to the run of 3 wins by Palace, now edging back to their traditional 40s points return at the end of the season?\n\nPalace and the elixir of confidence\n\nIsn't it incredible what a difference confidence makes to players and teams? It's like Jekyll and Hyde, how they can look so terrible one week and so inspirational the next.\n\nPalace were brave against Liverpool, sensing vulnerability, scored a great goal and then mostly defended for their lives and won the kind of game that we would say we earned, but I'm sure Liverpool might say was robbed. The embers of confidence began to glow from such application.\n\nWhen building confidence, what you really want is to play a team out of form and preferably with plenty of other problems too, like being demotivated and knackered. Like West Ham. Couldn't have come at a better time, and then the confidence is glowing red-hot. So much so that we can look after one of our stars on the bench last night and still win, playing wonderful football against a top-eight team. Mateta's first goal was beautiful in its simplicity; you have to love a quickly executed one-two and first-time finish. Simple football, superbly applied.\n\nThat all this has happened without three-quarters of our 'spine' is a testament to the team and the manager. First choice keeper (Johnstone), First-choice centre-back (Guehi) and first choice centre midfielder (Doucoure) all still out. And this on top of all the injuries to Olise and Eze, imagine the season we could have had... or could have next season. Alas, it seems likely that we'll sell at least one of our stars. We have a main stand to build and these guys are no Zaha, they weren't born down the road. The rich and elite will attempt to pick them off and/or sew disharmony. At least our recruitment is top drawer which gives me hope.\n\nTalking of rich and elite, it is especially pleasing to beat Newcastle, a club that was weak and vulnerable after many years of neglect and then sold their soul to the devil, looking to take the express lift to success, not caring to stop at the floors marked 'human rights abuses', 'hatred of women', 'murder' and 'sportswashing'. I've seen a post this week from a Toon commentator with the lament of those who truly know they are guilty; 'anyone else would do the same', specifically mentioning Palace. Well, no actually, we wouldn't. And neither I suspect would many others. We care about humanity and social justice and we want half-decent people in charge. We've built up from the ashes of administration and if we ever get success it will be deserved, not bought.\n\nAnd with a confident team, and a confident manager, we might just have half a chance.\n\nFinally, a mention to a sensible refereeing and VAR decision. The Newcastle player who felt Hughes breathe on him and did the pirouette that Eden Hazard perfected to make it look like a foul, was diving. People who say 'I've seen them given' leave out the first part of that sentence, which is 'it wasn't a pen, but...' and that phrase is almost as insidious as 'there was contact'. It's a contact sport. Fouls are given (or at least they should be) for being impeded, not contacted. That the Newcastle lad decided to go for the pen rather than have a shot from a great position, was his choice, and it backfired. VAR is still terrible, but hey, even a stopped clock is right every now and then.\n\nRob", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [],

I have done. It's my last derby',\" said Steve Bower.\n\n\"He was infuriated. This is Mac Allister not getting a free kick. That's John Achterberg his goalkeeping coach (he is pushing away).\"\n\nOwen responded: \"Everyone is calm before the game. But as soon as your opponents score, as soon as the game gets lively then, of course, you feel it. You are on the side of the pitch and you have got all that passion.\"\n\nThat's what you would probably ask for, but in truth, it has been asked for weeks now and it hasn't been delivered.\n\nIf getting knocked out of the Europa League with ease to Atalanta was bad enough, matters were made worse with that Crystal Palace defeat.\n\nThe players had the chance to react after that and they haven't.\n\nThe issue here is that there isn't just two teams in the Premier League title race, which has been the norm for years now, that's if Manchester City haven't wrapped it up already.\n\nSo, Liverpool now need Arsenal and Manchester City to both drop points, which in truth, simply isn't going to happen.", "source": {"uri": "rousingthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rousing The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amir_mir@rousingthekop.com", "name": "Amir Mir", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Dalglish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Dalglish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Achterberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Achterberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn1.rousingthekop.com/uploads/4/2023/09/GettyImages-1433177405-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

It almost feels like the end, and they've just got to make sure they finish the season out really strongly. At the moment they're not clinical enough in both boxes.\n\n\"I don't think it's the time to get too angry with the team or Jurgen Klopp. It's been a great ride, a great journey, but tonight is Everton's night. You have to take it on the chin.\"\n\nFair play to Carragher for keeping things in perspective so soon after such a harrowing defeat, one which leaves Klopp's glorious Liverpool tenure very likely to end with anti-climax.\n\nIt's hard to feel anything other than bitter disappointment right now, but the Sky Sports pundit is right. Despite this season petering out horribly, we owe so much gratitude to the manager and many of those players for the brilliant memories they've provided over the last five or six years in particular.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Empire of The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_togher@empireofthekop.com", "name": "Liam Togher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://icdn.empireofthekop.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/carragher-liverpool.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

It was a performance packed with passion and purpose from Everton.\n\nLiverpool may have had periods of dominance in possession, but they never got to grips with Everton's aerial threat and looked decidedly uncomfortable well before Jarrad Branthwaite opened the scoring.\n\nEverton hassled and harried for everything on an evening when everyone played their part. The Royal Blue spine of the team did everything asked of them. And then some.\n\nJordan Pickford's positioning was faultless and his instinctive goalkeeping is right up there with the best of them.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite put in another incredibly assured performance at the heart of the Everton defence and his partnership with James Tarkowski has been a key factor behind the team's 11 clean sheets this season.\n\nIdrissa Gueye was an impressive bundle of fractious energy at the heart of midfield.\n\nFinally, at the top end, Dominic Calvert-Lewin was the focal point and his ability to get Everton up the pitch proved priceless. His performance was right up there with the run of form that made him a regular in the England squad, before an injury plagued period undermined his footballing prowess. It was fitting that he soared highest at the far post to head in Dwight McNeil's right-wing corner just before the hour mark to double Everton's advantage.\n\nThere is still a bit to do before Premier League safety is assured, but three wins from four matches - with three clean sheets thrown in - is a good run of form at any stage of the season. For Everton, it has come precisely at the right time.\n\nThe 6-0 defeat at Chelsea sandwiched in between that run of victories was a new low and it pointed to worrying concerns about their future. But it is how you respond to setbacks that acts as a true measure of courage and conviction.\n\nEverton's response could hardly have been better.\n\nSean Dyche told his players in the dressing room at Goodison last night to enjoy the victory and all that it means - but the big test now is Brentford on Saturday evening.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Tarkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrissa_Gueye", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Idrissa Gueye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hjXA3_gGRD4y0Y7SoW7agQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/26761ed280ed0a1dded78427a1c5f9c5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-10-17", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Questions will remain as to whether the huge drop-off in intensity mirrors their manager's dwindling desire to keep going as he heads off into the sunset, but whatever has happened in the past few weeks should worry whoever comes next.\n\nUnlike Ferguson, who left Moyes with a squad no other manager would be capable of guiding to the same heights, Slot, if he is to take the Anfield reins, will inherit a playing personnel bulging with talent. It is just without their high-octane approach that has deserted them in their final hour, Liverpool as a club, as a philosophy, don't know what it is in its absence.\n\nWith so much at stake at Goodison Park on Wednesday night, on a ground Klopp had never tasted defeat in as a manager, we all expected one Merseyside rival to overwhelm the other. Just not this way round.\n\nEverton were first to everything, roared on by a raucous Goodison crowd who smelled blood. Having been humiliated by Premier League laughing stock Chelsea the previous week, Everton won 65 per cent of their duels in the first half, in a game that would ruin Liverpool's title hopes.\n\nIn the Klopp era, that kind of return does not happen. Defeats of course are part and parcel of the game, but to be bested on desire and relentlessness is not in the modern-day Liverpool vernacular. Not in such a history-defining fixture.\n\nWith the fire having gone out in the belly of Klopp's go-to goalscorer, Mohamed Salah, what lies beneath when the beast has been tamed is altogether more challenging to define.\n\nFor years, Jordan Henderson was Liverpool's hydra, the beast with nine heads. Whenever the opposition would have the ball, the skipper would be there, snarling and hassling opponents into submission. Further forward, while his samba feet wowed audiences across the globe, there were few better pressers than Roberto Firmino.\n\nWithout such figures in their ranks now, there was always likely to be some drop-off in intensity. The major problem, however, is an absence of the ceaselessness has left a squad lacking in some key areas.\n\nFinishing has been a problem all season - social media trolls would have had a quiet year without Darwin Nunez content - a flaw exemplified by Salah's yips in recent weeks.\n\nIn midfield, as Wataru Endo's form has waned, Klopp has been left with a talented bunch of square pegs for round holes. Is Alexis Mac Allister a No 6? Is Curtis Jones the real deal? What is Dominik Szoboszlai? All the next manager's problem.\n\nThen there is the ultimate quandary - the Trent Alexander-Arnold conundrum. He is too good to play full-back, but the positions he takes up as a defender make him even more dangerous, given his other-worldly passing range.\n\nWhen everything is going well, Alexander-Arnold can transform Liverpool into a different proposition altogether, but his forays into midfield can still leave Klopp's setup exposed, as happened on occasion at Goodison, when the intensity drops.\n\nThe question is, does the next manager want to keep the pressing game alive? Liverpool have known nothing else for the best part of a decade, so transitioning to any other approach is going to be a monumental undertaking.\n\nIf Everton can counter the press, however, perhaps it is time to let the philosophy leave with its founding father. As Klopp keeps eluding to, it is not his problem anymore. His successor's issues, however, are beginning to surface as the German's title dreams fade.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pete_hall@inews.co.uk", "name": "Pete Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Jones (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominik_Szoboszlai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominik Szoboszlai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wataru_Endo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wataru Endo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Firmino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Firmino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Recreations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Recreations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SEI_201350976.jpg?crop=640px%2C89px%2C1624px%2C915px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The damage had really been done by Crystal Palace at Anfield 10 days earlier. There's no getting away from the fact that it was at Goodison where Liverpool's dream finally went to die, though.\n\nThe result means that Klopp's final season with the Reds will end with a solitary Carabao Cup win. Ordinarily, that would not be means to hold a parade. But with Jurgen on his way out, there had been suggestions that one could be held anyway. Now, those claims have been cleared up.\n\nHad Liverpool have defied the odds and won the Premier League title, there would of course have been am open-top journey through the streets of the city.\n\nHad the Reds managed to make good on their tag as favourites for the Europa League, you'd imagine there would have been, too.\n\nThat would have provided supporters from across the city and beyond to come together to thank a manager who has transformed the club since his arrival in 2015.\n\nBut, it was not to be. As a result, The Times have now shared how likely it is that a parade will be held in Jurgen's honour anyway.\n\nThey claim that discussions have indeed been 'ongoing' with Liverpool City Council over a potential end-of-season celebration.\n\nHowever, unless the Reds do somehow end up winning the league from here, there will reportedly be no parade. Pity.\n\nThe answer to this question probably depends on who you ask. Some will feel it would be a nice touch to send one final salute to a manager who has given us everything. Others may see it as unnecessary and even a little cringey.\n\nIf you ask the outside world, they'll of course laugh at any suggestion of a parade without a big trophy to show for it.\n\nWith all of that in mind though, we'd actually have liked to have seen this happen. There's a question of whether Jurgen himself would have been up for it, but the German really has touched the lives of those in the city.\n\nMore than a footballing event, it could purely be a human one, a chance for the streets themselves to thank a man who came as an outsider and left with the keys to the whole flipping place.\n\nAnyway, it sounds like the decision has been made and that is that. We'll just have to make that Anfield goodbye extra special.

With 24 days left, all is freeze-framed for posterity: his last Merseyside derby, his last press conference put-down, his last casual haranguing of the fourth official. This was meant to be a chapter supercharged with joy and gratitude at the parting of a managerial visionary, but instead the dominant emotion, after his first Goodison defeat to Everton at the worst possible moment, is regret.\n\nThe source of this regret is not just the almost certain loss of a league title to adorn his farewell. It is the bitter memory of how, with four months of the season left, he delivered a quasi-presidential address to supporters and announced he was leaving. The theory was sound enough: that Klopp, a human fountain of inspiration and energy and heavy-metal analogies, could use his exit as an impetus, galvanising his players to perform at their highest level yet. \"Let's now really go for it,\" he urged. \"Let's squeeze everything out of this season and have another thing to smile about when we look back in the future.\"\n\nBut today's reality forms the chilliest contrast to that idealism. Liverpool do not just look like pale imitations of their usual freewheeling selves. They seem, in an uncanny mirroring of their manager's original justification for his departure, as if they have run out of energy. This loss to Everton was a case in point, with a petulant Darwin Nunez lacking any ruthlessness as a centre-forward, Virgil van Dijk achieving his only distinction in berating the referee, and a lethargic Mohamed Salah appearing to be asking himself why he did not accept last summer's \u00a3200 million offer from Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt is the change in Klopp's demeanour, though, that sounds the loudest alarm. Typically, this is a figure hyper-sensitive to every heartbeat, so attuned to Liverpool fans that he joins them in a sweary singalong at a Ukrainian airport. Now he simply appears numb, watching this campaign dissolve in familiar thwarted dreams. It would not be a surprise if, at some level, Klopp has mentally checked out, half-imagining a sun-kissed beach where he does not have to answer endless questions about title-race permutations. What is striking, though, is the openness with which he conveys his feeling of detachment.\n\n\"I just tried to figure out how I felt,\" he said, in the aftermath of his last European game with Liverpool, against Atalanta. \"And it was nothing.\" At this point, we must note that Klopp's reputation as a master motivator is well-earned. But it is hardly a surefire recipe for rousing your players to acknowledge that a dreadful result leaves you cold. It makes about as much sense, in all honesty, as telling them midway through the tightest three-way championship battle in recent memory that you are exhausted and on your way out.\n\nKlopp has been protected from a full inquisition into the timing of his resignation speech by Liverpool's form. Their triumph a month later in the Carabao Cup final, which he called his \"favourite\" of his 8\u00bd-year reign, suggested a man who could do no wrong. He had created one all-conquering side and here, thanks to a small galaxy of academy stars, he was bequeathing another. And yet the more Liverpool have wobbled during this decisive run-in period, the more the aura of infallibility has slipped.\n\nWayne Rooney, having watched a famous night for his beloved Everton, wasted little time in identifying the root of Liverpool's ills. \"The timing of Klopp leaving will definitely have had an effect on these players,\" he said. \"Players will look at that and see it as their way of getting out as well.\" It was an analysis difficult to dispute. As magnificent as Everton were here, sticking to a Sean Dyche masterplan of clinical counter-attack and beefy set-piece defence, Liverpool resembled a team prematurely pressing the brake pedal.\n\nExtended managerial send-offs are rarely the wisest ideas. Sir Alex Ferguson reflected how it was the \"biggest mistake\" of his career to announce in 2001 that he would retire at the end of that season, explaining that it led to several of his players \"putting their tools away\". Liverpool, vanquished in short order by Crystal Palace, Atalanta and Everton, are giving off a distinctly similar vibe. It is as if players such as Salah and Van Dijk, who have reached such extraordinary heights under Klopp, are struggling to comprehend life without him.

Firm, yes, but fair too, though with no shortage of aggression.\n\nIn an era where many tend to bemoan the death of physicality in the modern game, the towering performances of Ben Godfrey, Vitaliy Mykolenko, James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite felt like something of a throwback.\n\nA reminder of Bovril-scented terraces, of mud-bath pitches, and a time 'when men were real men'.\n\nKlopp, speaking after his unbeaten Goodison Park record was finally broken on his final visit to the blue half of Stanley Park, explained why he opted to keep the faith with Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and an out-of-sorts Mo Salah despite the trio all missing very presentable chances on a night in which Jordan Pickford's goal - for all of Everton's heroics - led a largely charmed existence.\n\nWith Diogo Jota and Cody Gakpo injured and ill respectively, 18-year-old Jayden Danns was Liverpool's only striking option on the bench. And Klopp, despite the desperation of Liverpool's situation, had no plans to introduce a talented but still-developing teenager into the blood-soaked lion's den that was Everton's penalty area.\n\n\"I know we had Dannsy on the bench,\" Klopp tells the Liverpool website. \"(But) that's not a game for an 18-year-old boy. Tarkowski and Branthwaite kill you in these situations.\"\n\nTarkowski, who also worked under Toffees boss Sean Dyche at Burnley, has his limitations. But when it comes to winning aerial duels, whacking clearances up the pitch and rattling the bones of nearby centre-forwards, there's not many better 'pure defenders' in the Premier League.\n\nBetween them, Tarkowski and the equally-outstanding Jarrad Branthwaite mustered 17 clearances, with the former Clarets colossus also managing five interceptions and three successful tackles (WhoScored).\n\nIt was Tarkowski's centre-half partner who gave Everton the lead in very scrappy style, meanwhile, Branthwaite's shot squirming over Alisson Becker and spinning over the line before Dominic Calvert-Lewin - scorer of the hosts' second - made absolutely sure.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, people were saying: 'Do they care?'. They care. We care. There are no two ways about that, and I think we made that clear as a collective,\" a delighted Dyche retorted following a win which put an eight point gap between Everton and the relegation zone, safety almost secured.\n\n\"Another clean sheet, as well, so I'm pleased with that. A couple of really big saves from Jordan. We get a little bit lucky with the one that hits the inside of the post (from Diaz in the second-half), but we've created enough chances ourselves.\n\n\"The energy of the side, the commitment to the cause, and the shape were all in place, and they have to when you play some of these sides. I thought the general performance was very good, and the reward is a big result against our local rivals.\"", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_owen@hitc.com", "name": "Dan Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tarkowski", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Tarkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Branthwaite", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jarrad Branthwaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalii_Mykolenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vitalii Mykolenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Godfrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Godfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park,_Liverpool", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Park, Liverpool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Dyche", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean Dyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogo_Jota", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diogo Jota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Calvert-Lewin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisson_Becker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alisson Becker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2146270406-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507412", "eventUri": "eng-9507412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223699574, "title": "Region tournaments reset: What&#8217;s happened so far, what&#8217;s ahead in baseball, softball, soccer and lacrosse", "text": "Region tournaments in baseball, softball and boys and girls soccer stretch into this week, and state tournament berths are on the line: any region finalists punch their tickets. Memorial Day is no longer full of baseball and softball quadruple-headers \u2014 those mostly went away when the Virginia High School League expanded its classifications. So now\u2019s a good time to reset things as most regions take a break before getting back underway Tuesday and Wednesday. Highlights so far In baseball, Lafayette pulled off the biggest stunner, knocking off defending state champion (and No. 1 seed) New Kent in a Class 3 Region A quarterfinals. In Class 5 Region A, the top two seeds are out after No. 5 seed Ocean Lakes knocked off No. 1 Great Bridge and No. 3 First Colonial sent second-seeded Cox packing. Ocean Lakes and First Colonial meet for the region title at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at Indian River High. The Class 6 Region A semis feature an all-Chesapeake showdown for a spot in the championship and automatic state tourney berth: Grassfield at Western Branch, 6 p.m. Tuesday. In softball, the top seeds all remain in the hunt for a region championship, including unbeaten Grassfield \u2014 the top-ranked team in the final 757 regular-season poll. The Grizzlies (19-0-1), bolstered by pitcher Braelyn Bailey (who also has 10 home runs at the plate), play a Class 6 Region A semifinal Tuesday against Deep Run. Top-seeded Kellam survived an upset bid from Deep Creek, winning 1-0 in the semifinals to set up a showdown with No. 2 seed Hickory in Tuesday\u2019s title game at Great Bridge High. No. 1 seeds Granby (Class 5 Region B), Gloucester (Class 4 Region A), New Kent (Class 3 Region A) and King William (Class 2 Region A) all play in semifinals Tuesday. In boys soccer, one defending state champion took out another when Kellam defeated Princess Anne 3-1 in a Class 5 Region A quarterfinal. Kellam was the Class 6 state champ last season but dropped to Class 5 this school year; Princess Anne won the Class 5 title last season. While most top seeds are around as the semifinals approach, Class 2 Region A is the outlier \u2014 four of the top five seeds have been sent home. No. 8 seed Poquoson took out No. 1 Nandua 3-2 in the quarterfinals. The Class 6 Region A, Class 5 Region A and Region B, Class 4 Region A tournaments all have a break this week until playing semifinals Wednesday. In girls soccer, Kellam \u2014 the top-ranked team most of this season in the 757 \u2014 appears on a collision course with Beach rival First Colonial in the Class 5 Region A tournament, while in Class 6 Region A, No. 3 seed Grassfield visits second-seeded Western Branch in a semifinal Tuesday with a state tourney berth at stake. In Class 4 Region A, top-seeded Jamestown survived a semifinal in overtime against Warhill and hosts No. 2 seed Smithfield for the championship at Wanner Stadium on Wednesday. No. 1 seeds Granby (Class 5 Region B), Lafayette (Class 3 Region A) and Poquoson (Class 2 Region A) are all through to the semifinals. In lacrosse, the Ocean Lakes girls and Kellam boys continued their region domination with Class 5 Region A Tournament championship runs. Both teams were unbeaten against public schools in the region and in the Beach District, and they\u2019re top seeds in next week\u2019s Class 5 state tournament, though they\u2019ll both be underdogs against the more established teams from central Virginia. The Beach District teams are in their second season as a VHSL-sanctioned sport. Kellam won the region championship 9-5 over Cox and outscored foes 54-9 in the region tournament. Ocean Lakes took the girls title with a 14-5 victory over Bayside and outscored opponents 49-13 in the region tournament.

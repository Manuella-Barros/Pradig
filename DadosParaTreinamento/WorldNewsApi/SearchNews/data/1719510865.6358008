Clarke, who is originally from Brighton, St.George, had eight children, but one of her daughters has passed. She is the grandmother of 14 and great grandmother of four. Her youngest daughter, Cheryl Carter, recalled that there were many days when her mother had nothing to give them but she would always make sure they eat, even if she had to go without eating. \u201cThe one thing I remember about Mom is she was very resilient. We hear people talk about being poor \u2026 I know what poor is \u2026. but we were never out there begging and we never let the world know \u2026 because Mom would always make sure [we had a meal],\u201d she said. She said their mother also made sure they had an education, adding \u201cwe\u2019re glad for that because we were able to turn around and then be able to give back to Mom for all the years she cared for us.\u201d Carter said the celebrations continued at the Hilton Barbados Hotel on Saturday where more family members and friends of the family got the opportunity to join in and share memories of the centenarian. She said a church service will be held at St Barnabas on Sunday for the 100th birthday celebration.", "summary": "<p>Barbados\u2019 newest centenarian, Millicent Clarke, was surrounded by family members as they celebrated her 100th birthday \u00a0at her St Michael home on Saturday.

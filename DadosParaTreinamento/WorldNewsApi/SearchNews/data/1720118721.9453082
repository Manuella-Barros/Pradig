Michael Stuerzenberger, a well-known German Islam critic, a police officer and four others were injured when the knifeman launched a frenzied attack in Mannheim on Friday. Mr Stuerzenberger, who was seen preparing to speak to a small crowd on a livestream earlier in the morning, was rushed to hospital before undergoing a successful surgery for the stabbing injuries to his face. A 25-year-old man from Afghanistan has been remanded in custody on supicion of attempted murder. Speaking for the first time from his hospital bed, Mr Stuerzenberger told BILD: 'It was like an apocalypse. He was stabbing me, even when I was lying on the floor and was trying to fight him off with my feet. It really was a nightmare. 'He stabbed my thigh which someone immediately isolated. One stab wound above the knee, it could have been worse. Another on the side of the chest, my upper arm is injured and three stab wounds to the head. My upper lip was cut and I have a deep cut to my jaw. 'We were about to start the event when he suddenly came storming at us like a hurricane and stabbed one after the other. It was insane. I guess even the police were surprised.' 'I'm keeping my fingers crossed [for the police officer] and hope that everything goes well.' He added: 'Every attack is an attack against all of us, against our free democratic state and those who ensure our security. Who attacks a police officer launches an attack against all of us.' The 59-year-old yesterday posted a picture of himself on his Telegram channel from his hospital bed, showing a long, bandaged cut on his upper lip and cheek. In a separate interview with Deutschland-Kurier, he said: 'I'm alright given the circumstances. I'm happy for all involved that yesterday went somewhat mild. There could have been deaths. It was really bad what the Afghan did with his knife. 'I've seen parts of the videos and the stab in the neck, twice, of the police officer. Hope his life is not in danger anymore. It was a clear attempted murder. Seven or eight stab wounds for me, one near lung, a bit closer and that would have been it.' He added: 'He definitely had [combat experience] when you look at the footage. 'It was a strike like lightning, so fast, I obviously got really deep wounds, you can see if from the side of my jaw.' It was around 11.35am local time on Friday when chaos broke out as a man dressed in a dark hooded jacket, green shirt and tracksuit bottoms lashed out with a knife, wounding six people including Mr Stuerzenberger, who was tackled to the ground and stabbed in the face and leg. The other victims were five men aged 25, 36, 42 and 54. Police arrived almost immediately and one officer jumped on one of the victims. There was confusion as to why the officer jumped on the victim, but this gave the aggressor a chance to stab the back of the policeman's neck. His colleagues were heard screaming 'throw the knife away!' However, with the knifeman not responding, the officers opened fire from near point blank range. In a follow-up video from the incident, a scramble of people can be seen embroiled in a punch-up next to signs advertising an anti-Israel protest. The group can be seen tackling each other to the ground while one man in a blue coat takes multiple swings at another person on the floor. After throwing a series of overarm punches, at least two cops are spotted lunging towards the man donning the bright coat until he is knocked to the ground. Officers seemingly tackled the man believing he was the assailant after seeing him beating up the other individual who was already floored. The attack was livestreamed on YouTube. Mr Stuerzenberger has been a part of of several far-right organisations, including the PEGIDA movement that holds regular marches in German cities. A 25-year-old man born in Afghanistan has been remanded in custody by a German court on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with the knife attack. Officials offered no information regarding the motive for the attack on Friday on the central square in Mannheim. A statement from police and prosecutors said that the suspect had lived in Germany since 2014, was married and has two children. His apartment in the town of Heppenheim was searched on Friday night and police recovered digital devices and the contents are being evaluated. Officials said that the suspect, who was shot and wounded by police, is in hospital and not in a condition to be questioned. They said he had no prior police record. They have not disclosed the suspect's citizenship or immigration status or how he came to Germany. The group, Pax Europa, describes itself as an organization that informs the public about the dangers posed by the 'increasing spread and influence of political Islam'. German interior minister Nancy Faeser called Islamist extremism a 'great danger'. 'I would like to thank the police officers who intervened immediately and the doctors and paramedics who are fighting for the lives of the victims of this terrible crime,' said the minister.", "summary": "Michael Stuerzenberger, a well-known German Islam critic, was seriously injured by the knifeman along with a police officer and several bystanders in the city of Mannheim on Friday.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13485611/German-Islam-critic-stabbed-face-rally-livestreamed-YouTube-brands-knifing-absolute-nightmare-warns-frenzied-assault-attack-against-free-democratic-state.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/02/12/85589437-0-image-a-52_1717329397401.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/06/01/816634463853497217/1024x576_MP4_816634463853497217.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:22:24", "author": "Arthur Parashar,Editor,Miriam Kuepper", "authors": ["Arthur Parashar", "Editor", "Miriam Kuepper"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.737}

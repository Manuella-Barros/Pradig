In 1657, when many people could neither read nor write, the foundations for the Papieri area, on the shores of Lake Zug in Cham, Switzerland, were laid. This first paper mill became a huge paper factory, which operated for 360 years until it was closed down in 2015 and the remaining Papieri buildings were classified as historical monuments. Now a bustling new quarter with apartments, lofts, studios and workplaces has been created. The Papieri site has been designed to be fully energy-efficient, climate-neutral and sustainable. All power for the site comes from renewable sources. An estimated 40% of its electricity needs is produced onsite using photovoltaic systems and its own hydro power plant on the nearby river. It has a site-wide linked energy network, which provides heating, cooling and electricity directly to each property. It\u2019s a popular and innovative development and so opportunities to buy a home have been limited, but Andri Mengiardi and Martina Isler were lucky. \u201cOur second child was born in a hospital very close to the Papieri,\u201d says Martina. \u201cA little later we happened to go past the building on a bike tour and saw a billboard advertising it. We decided to stay up to date with their newsletter and when the apartments were advertised in a pre-marketing campaign, we jumped at the chance. They were all sold within a few hours.\u201d Living in a landmark building makes the coordination and implementation of your own ideas quite a challenge, but the blank canvas provided by the developers was fertile ground for Andri to express his passion for interior decoration. \u201cI\u2019m CEO of a tech company, but my journey started somewhere else. I\u2019m a chef/cook as well, which was the first thing I learned when I left home at 15. I also love to dance,\u201d says Andri. \u201cWhere do I see parallels between interior design, technology, cooking and dancing? It is about closing your eyes and feeling what can or could be felt. It\u2019s about imagination and trying to leave patterns behind and taking some risks. It\u2019s about reducing complexity.\u201d The 200sqm loft is open plan with a mezzanine on the upper level accessible from a spiral staircase. At some points the ceiling reaches 6m high and the facade sections made of exposed concrete and sand-lime brickwork are retained and partially insulated inside the rooms. A loggia runs through the building and creates a climate buffer so that the windows, with their very slim profiles, can be left in place or replaced without changing the design. Despite the profoundly industrial soul of the loft, Andri has created a style that is both unexpected and extravagant, such as the decision to place a 5m palm tree in the children\u2019s room. \u201cFirst, I wanted to build a house inside the house. I did a lot of sketches for it, but in the end, it just felt right to create something completely different for the kids. The idea behind it is built around the notion of a city jungle. If our kids lie on the floor, they can now look up at the trees and ask themselves if they want to be the monkeys there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt fits perfectly into the high room and fills it with life and warmth,\u201d adds Martina. The furniture and lighting mixes classic pieces, such as chairs from Carl Hansen and an original Lounge Chair by Herman Miller imported from the USA, with refined elements from Vitra and Moormann and Swiss designs, including the Architonic shelving system. The kitchen features a Seilt\u00e4nzer table and Bruto chair, both by Moormann, while the Aim suspension lights were designed by Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec for Flos. Andri and Martina\u2019s new home has many facets. It is rough, it is light, in part even delicate, but what dominates is the power of introversion it radiates. The height gives a sense of calm and the homogeneity of the colours a warm feeling, all directed inward. It\u2019s a place that encourages creativity.", "summary": "<p>Once part of a paper mill, this flat on the banks of Lake Zug has turned over a new leaf</p><p>It all started with paper.

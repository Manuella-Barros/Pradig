Nadal\u2019s 14 wins across 19 years have defined the clay-court grand slam this century, but the Spanish influence stretches back to fellow former champions Juan Carlos Ferrero \u2013 now Alcaraz\u2019s coach \u2013 Albert Costa and Carlos Moya. Alcaraz, who faces Nadal\u2019s first-round conqueror Alexander Zverev in Sunday\u2019s title showdown, said: \u201cI have a special feeling about this tournament. \u201cI remember when I finished school, running to my home just to put the TV on and watch the matches here in the French Open. \u201cI watched a lot of matches. Of course Rafa Nadal dominating this tournament for, let\u2019s say, 14, 15 years. It\u2019s something unbelievable. \u201cI wanted to put my name on that list of the Spanish players who won this tournament. \u201cNot only Rafa. Ferrero, Moya, Costa, a lot of Spanish players, legends from our sport that won this tournament, I really want to put my name on that list, as well.\u201d Alcaraz\u2019s five-set semi-final victory over Jannik Sinner made him the youngest man to reach grand slam finals on all three surfaces; hard-court, grass and the clay of Paris. \u201cI knew that, I checked my phone after the win,\u201d added the Wimbledon champion. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s something great. Breaking new records is great for me. \u201cHonestly, before the final it\u2019s something that I really didn\u2019t want to think about, but obviously that means that I\u2019m playing good tennis on every surface, that is something that I really wanted to do when I started on the tour. \u201cSo it\u2019s a great feeling, but right now, I don\u2019t want to think about it.\u201d Zverev beat two-time runner-up Casper Ruud in his semi-final, on the day a court case against him for allegedly assaulting his ex-girlfriend was terminated after a settlement was reached. The 27-year-old was contesting a penalty order and fine of 450,000 euros issued last October. Zverev had always maintained his innocence and the settlement did not include an admission of guilt. With a tough week off the court behind him, the German fourth seed looked back at the struggles he has endured on it as he bids for a first grand slam title. Zverev was two sets up on Dominic Thiem, and a break ahead in the fifth, only to lose the US Open final in 2020. Then two years ago, while playing arguably some of the best tennis of his career, he suffered a horror ankle injury during his semi-final against Nadal. \u201cIt\u2019s not only this week. It\u2019s just the last few years. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing from basically the US Open final where I was two points away, to being rolled off in a wheelchair here two years ago. It\u2019s all part of my journey. \u201cLook, I\u2019m in the final. I haven\u2019t won yet. But I just want to play my best tennis and give myself the best chance. If I am able to do that and if I am able to lift that trophy, it will mean the world to me.\u201d", "summary": "Carlos Alcaraz is ready to fulfil his destiny and keep the Spanish flag flying over Roland Garros.", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/carlos-alcaraz-wants-to-keep-the-spanish-flag-flying-over-roland-garros-as-he-is-set-to-face-alexander-zverev-in-sundays-title-showdown-4658451", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjA5MDM5ODBhLTE2NTMtNGY4My1hZDQ4LWQzMmJjN2E0ZGIyZjphMWJjZTc0NS05MzhhLTQ0YWQtYjM0YS1jZmUzYWQ1ZWI5Mjk=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:32:26", "author": "Andy Sims", "authors": ["Andy Sims"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.018}

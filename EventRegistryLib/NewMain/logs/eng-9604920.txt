negotiated a loan deal for the RB Leipzig attacker, who was eager to earn regular football during the second half of the campaign in a bid to make Germany's Euro 2024 squad.\n\nA thigh injury sustained during the back end of the season means that the former Chelsea man will miss out on representing his country.\n\nHowever, he ended his time with Spurs having contributed two goals and three assists from his 13 appearances in the Premier League, 10 of which came from the starting lineup.\n\nPossessing the option of turning the loan switch into a permanent move, Spurs have been left with a decision to make over what to do with the 28-year-old.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nSpurs decide to keep Werner\n\nAccording to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, there is every chance that Werner will be remaining at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nNevertheless, it is alleged that a season-long loan move is more likely than a permanent deal being activated, the clubs having seemingly negotiated a compromise.\n\nRomano adds that there will be no change to the finances involved for the first loan spell, with both teams feeling that they are gaining value for money.\n\nWerner holds a contract at RB Leipzig for another two years, and his German employers seemingly hold the opinion that they are under no pressure to restrict themselves to permanent bids.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWerner could prove to be important signing\n\nHaving contributed just one assist during his final six appearances, Spurs fans may not necessarily be too enthused about another season with Werner in the squad.\n\nThat said, his five goal contributions came in separate matches and he would only complete the 90 minutes on three occasions.\n\nFurthermore, Ange Postecoglou faces upheaval in the attacking ranks with Richarlison and Bryan Gil each being tipped to leave, while Alejo Veliz will go back out on loan.\n\nParticipating with the Europa League will stretch the North Londoners' squad, with Werner's versatility theoretically a key asset to possess in order to manage so many matches.\n\nID:544672:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop

Again a lot of that will depend on the negotiations between the clubs and how Timo feels,\" he said. \"Again from my perspective I'm comfortable with that situation and I'll let the other guys steer it to see what kind of outcome there is.\"\n\nWerner is believed to be keen to remain at Tottenham and Postecoglou enjoyed working with the experienced former Chelsea winger, who proved to be a useful addition on the left wing in beating his man and drilling low crosses across the six-yard box as the Australian demands.\n\nThe metrics backed that up as before his injury, they showed that Werner in his 12 Premier League games for Spurs, was top among wingers in the division for putting in crosses as well as putting them into the six-yard box. He also topped the charts in the division for his dribble success rate and winning offensive duels.\n\nREAD MORE: Academy coach reveals plans for Tottenham wonderkids and outlines meeting with Ange Postecoglou\n\nREAD MORE: Tottenham wonderkid has pre-season tour plan to impress Ange Postecoglou amid Harry Kane claim\n\nWerner contributed five direct goal involvements in those 12 matches, not including passes that led to own goals for the opposition. On the other side of the coin, his finishing in front of goal was certainly something that let him down with a couple of high profile misses during his short spell at Spurs and that would need to improve next season.\n\nPostecoglou told football.london earlier this month about a potential deal for Werner: \"Timo we signed until the end of the season on loan and he's part of that strategy to see what we need to do in the summer and can we do it.\n\n\"Are there going to be other gaps and where does Timo fit in with that strategy? So we have a plan in place, and that was irrespective. I think he's been very good for us. He came in at a really important time in January when Sonny was away [at the Asian Cup] , then Richy got an injury.\n\n\"We were short in wide areas. Him coming in was very helpful for us and I think he's made an impact but in my mind to make those definitive decisions, I still need some clarity about what we've got here first.\"\n\nNow that decision has been made. Postecoglou wants a number of attacking signings and from that point of view extending Werner's loan could be an astute piece of business as it would not bite into Tottenham's transfer budget for those roles this summer, yet would add an experienced Champions League-winning attacker to a squad that needs to expand to handle Europa League football next season in a bigger fixture schedule.\n\nThe Spurs boss said just a few days ago that \"we've got a plan in place that I'm really comfortable with in terms of incomings and outgoings\".\n\nThat includes Werner, if another loan deal can be struck for him, and Postecoglou will likely see the German as a replacement for one of the set-to-depart Bryan Gil and Ivan Perisic, with another winger then to come in to replace the other. There is also Manor Solomon's future to be decided when he returns from the knee problems that ravaged his season.\n\nPostecoglou wants plenty of attacking additions this summer, with a striker high on the priority list, and he told football.london last week in Australia that it was a department that Spurs needed to bolster with more firepower and creativity.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely. It's no secret. You saw the way we finished the season. We obviously lost Richy and Timo as well with injuries but we're fairly light in that area,\" he said. \"We started last season with Manor and Perisic and we were quite healthy in that front third in terms of numbers, but as the year went on it became pretty evident that we need to bulk up. We're in Europe as well next year so we'll have more games and it's definitely an area of the park we'll need to strengthen.\"\n\nWerner is not perfect, particularly in front of goal after being so prolific for Leipzig in his early 20s, but as a chance-creating squad option with experience in Europe and the ability to beat a man and get those low crosses into the box, he could prove to be a very useful part of the squad jigsaw for Postecoglou this season.\n\nListen to the latest episode of Gold & Guest Talk Tottenham by clicking here!

Werner joined Tottenham from Leipzig in January on a loan with the option to buy for $18.5 million. He appeared in 13 games for Spurs, scoring two goals and adding three assists in limited time.\n\nWerner joined Tottenham in this year's winter transfer window. He joined a talented attacking crew of Richarlison, Brennan Johnson, Son Heung-min, and more, fitting in nicely. Werner split time as a center-forward and a left-winger cutting in with his right.\n\n\"He came in at an important time in January when Sonny [Son Heung-Min] was away [at the Asian Cup], then Richy [Richarlison] got an injury. We were short in wide areas,\" Postecoglou told ESPN. \"Him coming in was very helpful for us and I think he's made an impact but to make those definitive decisions, I still need some clarity about what we've got here first.\"\n\nOne of Werner's biggest difficulties at Spurs was a lack of finishing. Despite his shot attempts generating 3.7 expected goals (xG), Werner scored just twice. The difference showed how often he spurned his chances in front of the goal.\n\nHowever, Werner has become a versatile player for manager Ange Postecoglou, and his depth and experience will be needed going into the season. He can retain possession and beat his man on the wing while also creating opportunities. Werner is also a likable person among teammates and staff in the locker room.\n\nWith Werner snubbed from Julian Nagelsmann's Euro 2024 squad, nothing is blocking a summertime deal for the German. Werner is reportedly happy to stay in London thanks to the consistent playtime and relative success he found at the club.\n\n\"I think from our perspective there's a deadline there,\" Postecoglou told football.london. Again, much of that will depend on the negotiations between the clubs and how Timo feels. From my perspective, I'm comfortable with that situation and I'll let the other guys steer it to see what kind of outcome there is.\"\n\nPostecoglou and Tottenham higher-ups view Werner as a replacement for Bryan Gil, who was sparsely used in his time with Spurs. Gil will sign with Valencia on loan at the beginning of the transfer window. Winger Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 will also leave, likely signing with his boyhood club Hajduk Split.\n\nWerner should have a very successful season with Spurs, especially based on how he performed in his first stint with Spurs and how his skillset transformed during his time in London. He's creative and dynamic on the ball, and he offers an interesting competition in the attacking spots. Although Son will likely start on the left and Richarlison in the center, Werner offers healthy competition and depth in both positions.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_Heung-min", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Son Heung-min"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richarlison", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richarlison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brennan_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brennan Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timo_Werner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timo Werner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Asian Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Gil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Gil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Peri\u0161i\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNK_Hajduk_Split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HNK Hajduk Split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valencia CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240528_WST_509315_Werner-Tottenham.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604920", "eventUri": "eng-9604920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

He contributed goals against Brentford and Villa and three assists in those 13 appearances in the Premier League before a hamstring issue ended his season early in May.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Postecoglou revealed that Spurs were racing against time to agree a deal for Werner.\n\n\"I think from our perspective, there's a deadline there. Again, a lot of that will depend on the negotiations between the clubs and how Timo feels. Again, from my perspective, I'm comfortable with that situation, and I'll let the other guys steer it to see what kind of outcome there is,\" he said.\n\n\"It's no secret [we need new forwards]. You saw the way we finished the season, We obviously lost Richarlison and Timo Werner as well with injuries, but we're fairly light in that area. We started last season with Manor [Solomon] and [Ivan] Perisic.\n\n\"We were quite healthy in that front third in terms of numbers, but as the year went on it became pretty evident that we needed to bulk up. We're in Europe as well next year, so we'll have more games, and it's definitely an area of the park we'll need to strengthen.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

He started 10 times in the Premier League for Spurs, predominantly playing off the left wing.\n\nSpeaking to football.london after Tottenham's post-season friendly against Newcastle United in Australia, head coach Ange Postecoglou said on Werner: \"I think from our perspective there's a deadline there.

His numbers are not ground-breaking -- two Premier League goals and three assists from 10 starts -- but he slotted well into Postecoglou's system and provides a lot of what the manager wants from his wide players. He is fast, direct and makes good runs off the ball. He enjoys attacking the opposition right-back, firing those low crosses across the six-yard box and trying to pop up at the far post to convert crosses from the opposite side.\n\nIf there is an issue with Werner it is that his finishing is not as good as his movement but that will not be a surprise to anyone who watched him at Chelsea. There were times during the season -- like Newcastle away -- when he could not convert half-chances, making it harder for Spurs to get a foothold in the game.\n\nBut the overall package with Werner is more than just scoring goals, and he has been a popular individual with staff and team-mates alike so far. Son is likely to start the season as first choice on the left, unless he is used up front, but Werner is a useful alternative.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_pitt_brooke@nytimes.com", "name": "Jack Pitt-Brooke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange_Postecoglou", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ange Postecoglou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/28141355/timo-werner-scaled-e1716920060669.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604920", "eventUri": "eng-9604920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

With Werner under contract at Leipzig until 2026, there may have been some reservations about what conclusion the Red Bull-owned outfit come to.\n\nBut HITC have now been told that, as of Tuesday, Leipzig have accepted the terms put forward by Tottenham. Werner, as a result, will stay in the capital until 2025, a decision over his long-term future put on the backburner for now.\n\nDespite seeing his Premier League campaign cut short by injury - and despite scoring only twice in 13 Premier League games - the consensus is that Werner did a pretty respectable job under Postecoglou.\n\nBrought in during Heung-Min Son's Asian Cup absence and following the unavailability of Manor Solomon, Werner's speed and intensity on the flank made him pretty integral to Postecoglou's system, contributing impressively to a 2-2 draw at Man United and in a 4-0 hammering of Aston Villa.\n\nThe former Celtic boss had indicated, meanwhile, that he would be keen to keep working with Werner into 2024/25.\n\n\"Timo, we signed until the end of the season on loan,\" Postecoglou said a few weeks back, via ESPN. \"And he's part of that strategy to see what we need to do in the summer and can we do it.\n\n\"Are there going to be other gaps and where does Timo fit in with that strategy? We have a plan in place, and that was irrespective.\n\n\"I think he's been very good for us. He came in at a really important time in January when Sonny (Son Heung-Min) was away (at the Asian Cup), then Richy (Richarlison) got an injury.\n\n\"We were short in wide areas. Him coming in was very helpful for us and I think he's made an impact.

Looking forward to see you all in the stadium for an incredible season.\"\n\nOn a separate post from Spurs' official account, Werner added: \"I see how good the club is, how good we are as a team and my perspective in the team. The players are all very kind, so that made it easy for me. I feel very good here. I like it a lot.\"\n\nWerner becomes Tottenham's second official signing ahead of the 2024-25 campaign after Swedish starlet Lucas Bergvall, who agreed a summer switch to North London from Djurgardens back in February.\n\nID:544683:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect3807:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange_Postecoglou", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ange Postecoglou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timo_Werner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timo Werner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leipzig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/09/timo-werner.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604920", "eventUri": "eng-9604920", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 454630926, "relevance": 2}

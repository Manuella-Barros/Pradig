These setbacks, including the defeat of his son Nakul Nath in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections from the Chhindwara seat and his own failure to secure the people\u2019s mandate in the 2023 assembly polls diminished his political stature in the state despite his long-standing influence and strong candidacy. Nakul Nath\u2019s loss by a margin of 113,618 votes in a constituency historically dominated by the Nath family underscores the declining support for Kamal Nath and the Congress party in a region that was once their stronghold.Erosion of Kamal Nath\u2019s political strongholdA series of recent events have weakened Nath's control over the Congress party in Madhya Pradesh. In a significant development, former minister and close ally Deepak Saxena left the Congress party on March 22, coinciding with his son Ajay Saxena's defection to the BJP along with 400 other Congress members from Nath\u2019s stronghold of Chhindwara.Further compounding Nath's troubles, six corporators from his camp defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), adding to the ongoing political turbulence in the state. This defection coincided with the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, which aimed to unify and energize the party base. In the recent Lok Sabha elections, Kamal Nath\u2019s influence in Chhindwara was critically undermined when his son Nakul Nath lost by a notable margin. Chhindwara, a seat historically dominated by the Nath family, fell to the BJP, marking a shift in the political landscape. This defeat is a clear indicator of the diminishing support for Kamal Nath and the Congress party in a region once considered their stronghold.Electoral setbacks and BJP\u2019s strategic winIn the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Bunty Vivek Sahu secured 644,738 votes (49.41%) against Nakul Kamal Nath's 531,120 votes (40.7%), reflecting a decisive swing in favor of the BJP. This contrasted sharply with the 2019 results, where Nakul Nath narrowly retained the seat with a 3.01% lead over his BJP rival.The BJP's strategy to field Bunty Sahu, a long-time rival of Kamal Nath, paid off. Sahu, despite never having defeated Kamal Nath in previous contests, posed a consistent challenge and ultimately emerged victorious in 2024. The BJP's aggressive campaign in Chhindwara, which included the induction of thousands of Congress defectors, significantly bolstered their position. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, Bunty Vivek Sahu secured 644,738 votes (49.41%) against Nakul Kamal Nath's 531,120 votes (40.7%), reflecting a decisive swing in favor of the BJP. This contrasted sharply with the 2019 results, where Nakul Nath narrowly retained the seat with a 3.01% lead over his BJP rival.Moreover, Kamal Nath, who was the chief ministerial candidate for the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, failed to secure a mandate from the people. Despite exit polls predicting a favorable outcome for him, Nath was defeated by a significant margin in a surprising turn of events. The BJP won an overwhelming victory, securing 163 seats, while the Congress was limited to just 66 seats. Uncertain future for Kamal Nath and Congress The recent electoral outcomes have highlighted a decline in support for the Congress party in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP's clean sweep, securing all 29 seats in the state, underscores the fading influence of Kamal Nath, a once formidable figure in Madhya Pradesh politics. Kamal Nath, once celebrated as a close confidant and third son of Indira Gandhi and dubbed \u201cIndira ke do haath, Sanjay aur Kamal Nath,\u201d now faces the potential of political marginalization. His reputation, once bolstered by his unwavering loyalty and close association with the Gandhi family, is now overshadowed by recent setbacks and diminishing political clout.Adding to the challenges, rumors of Kamal Nath and his son Nakul Nath defecting to the BJP further eroded their credibility and allegiance to the Congress party during the crucial phase of the Lok Sabha elections. Despite these rumors, the lack of a clear denial only fueled speculation, contributing to a dent in their political standing. As the political landscape in Madhya Pradesh continues to shift, Kamal Nath\u2019s future in active politics appears increasingly uncertain. He now faces the arduous task of reassessing his political strategy and addressing the internal challenges within the Congress party if he hopes to remain a relevant force in the state\u2019s evolving political arena. !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script", "summary": "Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath faces challenges after electoral defeats of himself and his son Nakul Nath, diminishing his political stature in the state and weakening his control over the Congress party.", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bjps-clean-sweep-in-madhya-pradesh-what-went-wrong-for-congress-in-chhindwara-is-this-the-end-of-the-road-for-kamalnath/articleshow/110817230.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-110820493/110820493.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:56:50", "author": "Ayush Pandey", "authors": ["Ayush Pandey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "IN", "sentiment": 0.253}

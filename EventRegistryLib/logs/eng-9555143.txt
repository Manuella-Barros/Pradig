(NASDAQ:HAS) has raised $500 million of corporate debt through a sale of 10-year bonds, its first bond sale since 2019.\n\nThe toy giant behind staples such as Monopoly, Beyblade and Play-Doh and film franchises Transformers and G.I. Joe issued debt with yields of 1.6% above treasury bills on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of Nova Scotia managed the sale, a source told the outlet.\n\nHasbro previously issued $2.4 billion worth of bonds in November 2019 to finance a portion of its $4 billion acquisition of London-based entertainment company Entertainment One Ltd.\n\nSince the acquisition, Hasbro has sold several business segments. Among them was the sale of EOne's film and TV divisions to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. for $375 million and the assumption of Hasbro's production financing. In addition, Hasbro sold EOne's music rights platform eOne Music to Blackstone for $385 million in 2021, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThe offering was preceded by the company's recent first-quarter earnings beat. Hasbro earned 61 cents per share, exceeding analysts' estimates of 27 cents per share on an adjusted basis amid the company's long-standing turnaround. The company also reported first-quarter sales of $757.30 million, above the consensus analyst estimate of $738.61 million.\n\nThe company has encountered abnormally low consumer demand in the U.S. In February, the company reported a tumble in holiday-quarter sales amid a broader decrease in consumer discretionary spending. This follows an overall slowdown in the amount of credit card debt talked on by U.S. consumers. In response, the company laid off a significant part of its workforce.\n\nNow Read: NFL Rule Could Open Door For Big Money Investors: Will Your Team Go Up For Sale?\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_One", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyblade_(manga)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyblade (manga)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

The toymaker is selling 6.05% notes maturing in 10 years that will accrue interest beginning May 14, with semi-annual payments beginning Nov. 14. The notes yield 1.6 basis points. The net proceeds from the offering, which is expected to close on or about May 14, will be approximately $459 million, according to a news release. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Scotia Capital are managing the bond sale. The announcement comes after Hasbro last month reported a profit of $58.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared with a loss of $22.1 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, the company said it earned a profit of 42 cents per diluted share compared with the 16-cent loss per diluted share last year. Earnings, adjusted for nonrecurring costs and amortization costs, came to 61 cents per share for the quarter. However, on March 13 Hasbro posted a loss for 2023 of $1.49 billion in what the company called a \"challenging\" year. Revenue for the year totaled $5 billion. On Dec. 11, Hasbro announced it would lay off an additional 1,100 employees globally as part of a further company restructuring and would leave its Providence office adjacent to the Amica Mutual Pavilion and Providence Public Library by the end of 2024. That followed an announcement earlier in 2023 that the toy and entertainment company was going to cut 1,000 jobs during the year to save up to $300 million annually by 2025. Those layoffs included a 20% reduction in staff at the company's film production company, Entertainment One. On Dec. 28, Hasbro completed the sale of its Entertainment One film and TV business to Lionsgate for $375 million. the sale included unscripted television production companies Renegade and Daisybeck and its interest in the Canadian film & TV operations of Entertainment One Canada Limited. That sale was part of Hasbro's Blueprint 2.0 strategy, with the company continuing to develop and produce entertainment based on its vault of Hasbro brands. The company previously launched a new entertainment division in August to bring its existing film, television, animation and digital businesses under one umbrella.", "source": {"uri": "pbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Providence Business News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hasbro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotiabank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotiabank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawtucket,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pawtucket, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pawtucket, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_One", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amica_Mutual_Pavilion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amica Mutual Pavilion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Employment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets.pbn.com/2024/05/Hasbro-logo-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555143", "eventUri": "eng-9555143", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 210, "textEnd": 216, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-14", "textStart": 254, "textEnd": 261}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 983, "textEnd": 991}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-11", "textStart": 1132, "textEnd": 1139}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-28", "textStart": 1669, "textEnd": 1676}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

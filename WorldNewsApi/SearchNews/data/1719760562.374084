So much better than last season!\u2019 @minhoform: \u2018why does the logo need to be yellow\u2019 @ayeplus88: \u2018That\u2019s a lot better\u2019 @garydg7: \u2018An absolute beauty\u2019 @ticgran: \u2018I\u2019m liking it\u2019 @nablusnoelie1: \u2018I like it\u2019 @RogerMcMonagle: \u2018Not our greatest ever kit but a million times better than last years abomination\u2019 @andymuirhd: \u2018Thoughts on the new Celtic kit? Don't like the dark green flashes and hate the broken Hoops BUT much better than last season's effort. Can we just go back to standard Hoops please\u2019 @kpowalker: \u2018I convinced myself I wasn\u2019t going to buy a new Celtic top this year. Who am I kidding\u2019 @MaedaMealOfThat: \u2018Show me Idah\u2019 @Goose1167: \u2018That Adidas badge is huge. The Star should always be GOLD\u2019 @Declan9723: \u2018Idah liked to have seen a new player in this\u2019 @jaimelawson08: \u2018I want to see Matt O\u2019riley in the shirt or I won\u2019t be buying it\u2019 @weedavebhoy: \u2018Adidas badge on the top is too big. Star should always be gold. Adidas on front of socks. I understand advertising, but there's too much emphasis on the Adidas logo's for me.\u2019 @Michael85142995: \u2018Outstanding. Can I order one with Idah in it please. Thanks in advance for your cooperation\u2019 @ghodsgift: \u2018Better than last season but still meh\u2019 @RoccoD67: \u2018At least you\u2019ll not get pelters this year. This strips actually not bad\u2019 Celtic will be hoping that they can win more trophies next season in their new kit. They won the Scottish Premiership and Scottish Cup double in this past campaign. Brendan Rodgers was brought back last year following Ange Postecoglou\u2019s exit to Tottenham Hotspur and managed to retain the title ahead of rivals Rangers. Their 2023/24 shirt didn\u2019t go down too well but their latest one seems to have been received better on social media.", "summary": "<p>Celtic have released their brand new home shirt ahead of the summer as they prepare for next season in the Scottish Premiership</p>", "url": "https://www.glasgowworld.com/sport/football/celtic/celtic-supporters-say-the-same-thing-about-new-202425-home-shirt-4645985", "image": "https://www.glasgowworld.com/jpim-static/image/2024/05/11/12/52/GettyImages-2152451963.jpg.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:09:58", "author": "Harry Mail", "authors": ["Harry Mail"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.141}

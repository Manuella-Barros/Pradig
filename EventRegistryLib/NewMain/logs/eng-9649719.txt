Officials say the fire destroyed several homes, prompted evacuations and forced the temporary closure of a highway while crews battled the flames. (Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management via AP)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- A wildfire near an Arizona community destroyed at least six homes, prompted overnight evacuations and closed the main highway between Phoenix and Las Vegas before an army of firefighters arrived to stem the flames, a fire official said Thursday.\n\nNo injuries were reported after the fire, reported around 4 p.m. Wednesday, spread quickly through Hassayampa River greenery and across U.S. 60, a freeway-style four-lane divided highway just south of Wickenburg, said Tiffany Davila, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management. An investigation team was probing the cause of the fire, which Davila said had not been determined.\n\nThe highway remained closed, but Davila said evacuation orders for residents were lifted before noon. An aerial survey showed 166 acres (67 hectares) burned.\n\nDavila said cooler nighttime temperatures, a rise in humidity and the arrival of about 200 local, state and federal firefighters helped quell the fire, along with aircraft scooping water from a nearby reservoir to drop on flames.\n\nThere was no immediate containment estimate, but Davila said officials reduced the number of homes deemed threatened from 100 late Wednesday to about 25 on Thursday.\n\n\"As temperatures warm, we could see fire activity increase,\" she added.\n\nThe fire comes as heat warnings remain in effect after several days of record high temperatures across a broad swath of the U.S. Southwest. The National Weather Service predicts that it could be early July before monsoon rains arrive to provide relief from hot, dry weather.\n\nIn Phoenix, 52 miles (83.6 kilometers) southeast of Wickenburg, forecasters warned Thursday of excessive heat and \"dangerously hot\" weather through Sunday, with daytime temperatures expected to reach up to 112 Fahrenheit (44.4 Celsius).\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tiffany Davila with the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said about 100 homes were threatened.\n\nJust before midnight, some residents were allowed return to their homes, except for people living between the rest area and the Hassayampa River Preserve on the U.S. 60. This left 20-25 homes still threatened by the fire, Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said.\n\nThe community of Turtleback Mountain Ranch was been told to get ready to evacuate, the Wickenburg Police Department said. They also said the Red Cross is heading there to set up an evacuation center at the Wickenburg Community Center.\n\nA 5-mile stretch of the U.S. 60 remains shut down between 288th Avenue and State Route 74, between Wickenburg and Morristown.\n\nDavila said the flames have jumped the U.S. 60 freeway, so it's burning on both sides, with most of the activity on the northwest and southwest sides.\n\nThe wildfire started on Wednesday afternoon in the Hassayampa River bottom and has burned roughly 150 acres, police said. It's burning salt cedar, grass and brush.\n\nDavila said crews have a heavy attack from the air and on the ground. A dozer arrived around 6 p.m. to help protect homes. Officials said Thursday morning that overnight increased humidity and cooler temperatures helped decrease overall fire activity and kept it from moving.\n\nThey said six structures, including four homes, have been destroyed as of Thursday morning.

The state had no choice but to shut down U.S. 60.\n\nBianca Buono of 12 News shared a video that captures just how disruptive this wildfire was on Wednesday evening.\n\nTake a look:\n\nPhotos have been released by a breaking news journalist that show several houses destroyed near Wickenburg.\n\nThe current belief is this wildfire burned for 150 acres. Obviously, the hot and dry conditions in Arizona didn't help out matters.\n\nHere's the latest update from the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management:\n\n\"Overnight increased humidities & cooler temps helped decrease overall fire activity & kept it from moving. Engines patrolled the fire's perimeter overnight to ensure fire stayed w/n footprint. Still 150 ac. w/a helo flight scheduled for this morning to provide for better aerial intel & updated mapping. No containment. Six primary structures confirmed destroyed in the fire. US 60 remains closed in both directions outside of Wickenburg. Downed power lines across highway.

This Savvy Bond Buy Is 12% Off", "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Fixed Income, making money concept getty This market rally could roll right through the summer (so much for \u201cSell in May and go away!\u201d), and we\u2019ve got two sweet bond buys to play it. That\u2019s right, I said bonds because there are more bargains in bond land than in stocks right now. While stocks could keep floating higher, the last thing we want to do is chase this rally. Instead, we\u2019re going to ride along on the stock side of things. In bonds, though, the state of play is a bit different. We\u2019re going to list our two bond picks in order of appeal shortly, capping this article off with our top selection\u2014an unsung closed-end fund (CEF) trading for 12% below its \u201ctrue\u201d value and yielding a stout (and tax-free) 5.8%. Powell\u2019s \u201cQuiet QE\u201d Has Yet to Be Fully Felt in Bonds Over the last few weeks, we\u2019ve talked a couple times about the Fed\u2019s \u201cQuiet QE.\u201d That\u2019s what we call Jay\u2019s habit of going full Dirty Harry when talking about interest rates and then, behind the scenes, quietly pumping liquidity into the system. He did it in March 2023, when the banking system was wobbling. The last thing Jay wants is Financial Crisis II, so he put his printing press in silent mode, and it\u2019s been humming along in the Fed\u2019s basement ever since, as you can see in this chart of bank reserves: Money Printing Restarts Federal Reserve MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours\u2014Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown, Ohio Injures At Least 7 Trump Lashes Out At Robert De Niro After Actor Calls Him A Tyrant Outside Courthouse Then there\u2019s what you might call \u201cloud\u201d QE, which is taking a haircut, too. At his early May press conference, Jay said he\u2019d cut the amount of Treasuries the Fed lets run off its balance sheet by half, to $25 billion from $60 billion. In other words, the central bank will buy any Treasuries over the $25-billion cap. We see what you did there, Jay! The 10-year Treasury rate, which controls the \u201clong\u201d end of the rate curve (and regularly thumbs its nose at the Fed) has long since figured Jay out. It\u2019s continued to move lower since peaking below the 5% line in April, the last time inflation worries spiked. It\u2019s likely to keep falling (in the usual two-steps-forward, one-step-back way, of course), as Jay keeps quietly supporting markets for now, then cuts the Fed funds rate as the economy slows. The upshot? Higher prices for bonds! The most direct play here is the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), the go-to for tracking Treasury prices. We bought TLT in November 2022, another time investors overestimated inflation\u2019s staying power, in my Contrarian Income Report service. We only held TLT for about seven weeks, from November 4, 2022, to December 21, 2022. But what a seven weeks. TLT rewarded us with fast 10.6% total returns, mostly price gains. These profits annualized to 82%! This time around, TLT is beaten down again, a nice entry point as rates continue to fall and bond prices make their corresponding rise. One side note here: Please note that many websites will say TLT only yields 3.8%. That\u2019s not true. Always use SEC yield when evaluating bond funds. This is the distribution stat developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission itself to support a truer yield measurement. The trailing 12-month yield\u2014which is lazily quoted\u2014gets \u201cstale\u201d quickly. Things turn on a dime in the bond world! SEC yield reflects the interest the fund earned, minus expenses, over the past 30 days. It\u2019s the best guide for us today and tomorrow. For bond yields, we want to know where we\u2019ll go, not where we\u2019ve been. In TLT\u2019s case, we\u2019re looking at a richer 4.6%. To be sure, an economic slump will inevitably arrive. When it does, investors will flock to the safest bonds on the planet. They always do! That makes TLT appealing here. But there\u2019s another ticker that looks even better. Let\u2019s talk about it now. Municipal-Bond CEFs Top Bond ETFs for Income, Upside Municipal bonds (used by state and local governments to fund infrastructure projects), which is too bad, because they\u2019re a terrific play as rates decline. And the Nuveen Municipal Credit Income Fund (NZF) tops our list here. The main reason? Dividends! NZF yields 5.8%, but its payout is federally tax-free for most Americans. That makes a huge difference, especially for those in the highest bracket: Tax Equivalent Yields Raymond James Unlike ETFs, CEFs generally have the same number of shares for their entire lives. That means they can, and regularly do, trade at different levels than their portfolio values, and very often at a discount. (You don\u2019t get this deal with ETFs, which never trade at a discount.) Right now, muni CEFs are cheap. NZF sports a 12% discount to net asset value (NAV), meaning we\u2019re getting its muni-bond portfolio for 88 cents on the dollar! Over the last five years, the fund has sported an average discount of 7.6%. So a return to that level\u2014inevitable in my view\u2014would \u201cbake in\u201d a 5.3% bump in the share price. That\u2019s before we factor in NAV gains, which seem assured as rates move lower and \u201csafe and sound\u201d munis appeal to more conservative folks. Nuveen is our go-to for munis at Contrarian Income Report because they get the first call when new issues are released and, hence, the best deals. That\u2019s a huge, totally underappreciated edge, and we can see it in action when we stack NZF up against the \u201calgorithm-run\u201d muni-bond benchmark, the iShares National Muncipal Bond ETF (MUB). CEFs Outperform Ycharts One more thing: In the event of a crisis, we know the Fed will step into the muni market. Heck, if Powell is running the presses (albeit in the background!) today, we know that if munis even begin to show stress, Jay will be buying alongside us. So as the financial world enters the \u201csummer doldrums,\u201d munis stand out as a great place to put money to work\u2014and NZF is at the top of our list.

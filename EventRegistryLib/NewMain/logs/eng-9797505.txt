She was assured of a medal, which could have been India's fourth in the Paris Olympics, and first outside shooting.\n\nFollowing this heartbreaking development, Vijender insisted that Vinesh was a victim of a 'big conspiracy against India' and that she should have had some more time to shed those 100 grams of extra weight.\n\n\"It's a huge conspiracy against India and Indian wrestlers. The way she has performed is worth appreciating. Maybe some people couldn't digest the happiness. We can reduce five to six kgs in one night, so what's the problem with 100 grams. I feel that someone had some problems and so the step to disqualify was taken. She should have got a chance to reduce the 100 grams,\" Vijender told India Today. \"Having participated in the Olympics, I have never seen anything like this.\"\n\nVijender, who 16 years back became the first Indian boxer to win a medal at the Games, explained how athletes keep their focus on recovery and weight control rather than food intake after every bout.\n\n\"We do not need carbohydrates and protein, we need recovery at first. We know that he have a bout tomorrow. So, weight control is the first on our priority list. We go to our physio because our body is tired and we can control our hunger. But we focus more on our recovery, not our food intake,\" Vijender added.\n\nAccording to article 11 of the International Wrestling Rules, Vinesh will be replaced by the wrestler who lost against her in the semi-final and hence Guzman Lopez Yusneylis will compete in the final against Hilderbrandt.

Photograph: Nick Laham/Getty Images from the Rediff Archives\n\nIndian boxing stalwart Vijender Singh has alleged that wrestler Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the Olympics final might be a case of sabotage as elite athletes like her are well-versed with the techniques of cutting weight before major competitions.\n\nVijender, who is India's first and only male boxer to have won an Olympic medal, knows a thing or two about maintaining weight before major bouts and he said it is shocking that Vinesh (50kg) was 100gm over in the weigh-in before an Olympic final.\n\n\"I think it might be sabotage. 100gm, you have got to be kidding me! We athletes can shed 5 to 6kg overnight. It is difficult, no doubt, but we know how to control our hunger, thirst, and exert to the extreme,\" the middle-weight (75kg) boxer told PTI.\n\n\"And when I say sabotage I mean people who are not happy to see India rise as a sporting nation. This girl has been through so much, your heart breaks for her. What more could she have done? Which other test?\" he wondered.\n\nVinesh was the face of a lengthy protest against former Wrestling Federation of India head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment and intimidation by women wrestlers. She had endured police detention, nights on the streets and a tumultus qualification process before making it here.\n\nThe highlight of her remarkable performance at the Olympics was the opening win over defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan who came into the competition undefeated in her international career.\n\n\"I can't believe that Vinesh would make a mistake like this. She has been an elite athlete for so long that she knows, there has to be something more to it. I am worried for her, I hope she is fine. What has happened is not good at all,\" said Vijender, a trailblazer in Indian boxing.\n\nIMAGE: Wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat address a press conference at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi during the protests against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, in 2023. Photograph: ANI\n\nAthletes who compete in contact sports, where fights are held as per weight categories, have to go through the painful process of staying within their divisions.\n\nIt involves going hungry for hours, avoiding even liquids and in some desperate situations, stay huddled inside layers of blankets to sweat out the extra weight.\n\n\"There have been times when I have spat out saliva continuously so that nothing goes inside. One can't imagine this extreme exercise. There are special Sauna suits that we wear, they feel like a furnace and there are times we run wearing them to shed weight,\" he explained.\n\nIt's an extraordinary exercise that takes a physical and mental toll on athletes and in 2018, six-time world champion woman boxer M C Mary Kom, in an interview to PTI, had revealed how she lost 2kg in a matter of four hours.\n\nMary Kom had landed in Poland for a tournament, where she eventually picked up her third gold of that year. But hours before she was to take the ring, she had gone through the strenuous process of shedding weight just to be eligible to fight.\n\n\"We landed in Poland at round 3-3:30 in the morning and the general weigh-in was at around 7:30am. I was a couple of kilograms above 48kg, the category I compete in, at that point,\" she had said.\n\n\"So, I had roughly four hours to shed that or I would have been disqualified for being over-weight at the time of general weigh-in. But I did skipping for an hour at a stretch and just like that, I was ready.\n\n\"Thankfully, the flight we travelled in was nearly empty so I could sleep with my legs outstretched, ensuring that I was not stiff on landing there. Otherwise, I don't know how I would have been able to compete,\" she had revealed.\n\nTHE OLYMPICS, 2024", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijender_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vijender Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Bhushan_Sharan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rediff.com", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rediff.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yui_Susaki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yui Susaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajrang_Punia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bajrang Punia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jantar_Mantar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jantar Mantar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contact sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Kom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/sports/2021/jun/23vijender.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797505", "eventUri": "eng-9797505", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-08-23", "textStart": 370, "textEnd": 385}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Here is what he said -\n\nOn Wednesday (Aug 7), Vinesh Phogat dealt a huge blow as she was disqualified for her gold medal match in women's 50kg freestyle wrestling final at the ongoing Paris Olympics 2024 edition for being marginally overweight. On the day of her final game, versus USA's Sarah Hildebrandt, Vinesh weight just above the permissible limit as the Indian bowed out before her gold medal face-off and will now return home empty-handed.\n\nAfter this news broke out, it left the whole of India in despair as many had their hopes on Vinesh to bring India its maiden gold medal in Paris 2024. Following the shocking disqualification, 2008 Beijing bronze medallist boxer Vijender Singh slammed the decision and made a huge accusation.\n\nTalking to India Today, Vijender said, \"It's a huge conspiracy against India and Indian wrestlers. The way she has performed is worth appreciating. Maybe some people couldn't digest the happiness. We can reduce five to six kgs in one night, so what's the problem with 100 grams. I feel that someone had some problems and so the step to disqualify was taken. She should have got a chance to reduce the 100 grams.\"\n\n\"Having participated in the Olympics, I have never seen anything like this,\" Vijender further stated.\n\nAlso read: Paris Olympics: You don't need a gold medal...' - PM Modi, Bindra react to Vinesh Phogat's disqualification\n\nVijender, the first Indian to win an Olympic boxing medal (bronze) in 2008, went onto explain how athletes focus on recovery and weight control rather than food intake during the hectic schedule at the Games.\n\nIn this regard, he added, \"We do not need carbohydrates and protein, we need recovery at first. We know that he have a bout tomorrow. So, weight control is the first on our priority list. We go to our physio because our body is tired and we can control our hunger. But we focus more on our recovery, not our food intake.\"\n\nFollowing Vinesh's disqualification, PM Narendra Modi also took to his official account on X and wrote, \"Vinesh, you are a champion among champions! You are India's pride and an inspiration for each and every Indian. Today's setback hurts. I wish words could express the sense of despair that I am experiencing.\"\n\nHe added, \"At the same time, I know that you epitomise resilience. It has always been your nature to take challenges head on. Come back stronger! We are all rooting for you.\"\n\nNotably, Vinesh competed at the 53kg in the Paris Games, contrary to her usual 50kg, and was a favourite to return with gold after defeating the likes of Yui Susaki in pre-quarters, Oksana Livach in quarters and Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lope in the semifinal bout.

We athletes can shed 5 to 6kg overnight. It is difficult no doubt but we know how to control our hunger, thirst, and exert to the extreme,\" the middle-weight (75kg) boxer told PTI.\n\n\"And when I say sabotage I mean people who are not happy to see India rise as a sporting nation. This girl has been through so much, your heart breaks for her. What more could she have done? Which other test?\" he wondered.\n\nVinesh was the face of a lengthy protest against former Wrestling Federation of India head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment and intimidation by women wrestlers. She had endured police detention, nights on the streets and a tumultus qualification process before making it here.\n\nThe highlight of her remarkable performance at the Olympics was the opening win over defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan who came into the competition undefeated in her international career.\n\n\"I can't believe that Vinesh would make a mistake like this. She has been an elite athlete for so long that she knows, there has to be something more to it. I am worried for her, I hope she is fine. What has happened is not good at all,\" said Vijender, a trailblazer in Indian boxing.\n\nAthletes who compete in contact sports, where fights are held as per weight categories, have to go through the painful process of staying within their divisions.\n\nIt involves going hungry for hours, avoiding even liquids and in some desperate situations, stay huddled inside layers of blankets to sweat out the extra weight.\n\n\"There have been times when I have spat out saliva continuously so that nothing goes inside, you know. One can't imagine this extreme exercise. There are special Sauna suits that we wear, they feel like a furnace and there are times we run wearing them to shed weight,\" he explained.\n\nIt's an extraordinary exercise that takes a physical and mental toll on athletes and in 2018, six-time world champion woman boxer M C Mary Kom, in an interview to PTI, had revealed how she lost 2kg in a matter of four hours.\n\nMary Kom had landed in Poland for a tournament, where she eventually picked up her third gold of that year. But hours before she was to take the ring, she had gone through the strenuous process of shedding weight just to be eligible to fight.\n\n\"We landed in Poland at round 3-3:30 in the morning and the general weigh-in was at around 7:30am. I was a couple of kilograms above 48kg, the category I compete in, at that point,\" she had said.\n\n\"So, I had roughly four hours to shed that or I would have been disqualified for being over-weight at the time of general weigh-in. But I did skipping for an hour at a stretch and just like that, I was ready.\n\n\"Thankfully, the flight we travelled in was nearly empty so I could sleep with my legs outstretched, ensuring that I was not stiff on landing there.

This girl has been through so much, your heart breaks for her. What more could she have done? Which other test?\" he wondered.\n\nVinesh Phogat's Struggles and Triumphs\n\nVinesh was the face of a lengthy protest against former Wrestling Federation of India head Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has been accused of sexual harassment and intimidation by women wrestlers. She had endured police detention, nights on the streets and a tumultus qualification process before making it here.\n\nThe highlight of her remarkable performance at the Olympics was the opening win over defending champion Yui Susaki of Japan who came into the competition undefeated in her international career.\n\n\"I can't believe that Vinesh would make a mistake like this. She has been an elite athlete for so long that she knows, there has to be something more to it. I am worried for her, I hope she is fine. What has happened is not good at all,\" said Vijender, a trailblazer in Indian boxing.\n\nThe Intense Weight-Cutting Process in Combat Sports\n\nAthletes who compete in contact sports, where fights are held as per weight categories, have to go through the painful process of staying within their divisions.\n\nIt involves going hungry for hours, avoiding even liquids and in some desperate situations, stay huddled inside layers of blankets to sweat out the extra weight.\n\n\"There have been times when I have spat out saliva continuously so that nothing goes inside, you know. One can't imagine this extreme exercise. There are special Sauna suits that we wear, they feel like a furnace and there are times we run wearing them to shed weight,\" he explained.\n\nMary Kom's Weight-Cutting Experience: A Case in Point\n\nIt's an extraordinary exercise that takes a physical and mental toll on athletes and in 2018, six-time world champion woman boxer M C Mary Kom, in an interview to PTI, had revealed how she lost 2kg in a matter of four hours.\n\nMary Kom had landed in Poland for a tournament, where she eventually picked up her third gold of that year. But hours before she was to take the ring, she had gone through the strenuous process of shedding weight just to be eligible to fight.\n\n\"We landed in Poland at round 3-3:30 in the morning and the general weigh-in was at around 7:30am. I was a couple of kilograms above 48kg, the category I compete in, at that point,\" she had said.\n\n\"So, I had roughly four hours to shed that or I would have been disqualified for being over-weight at the time of general weigh-in. But I did skipping for an hour at a stretch and just like that, I was ready.\n\n\"Thankfully, the flight we travelled in was nearly empty so I could sleep with my legs outstretched, ensuring that I was not stiff on landing there. Otherwise, I don't know how I would have been able to compete,\" she had revealed.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijender_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vijender Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_Federation_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling Federation of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yui_Susaki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yui Susaki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brij_Bhushan_Sharan_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mary Kom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_at_the_2014_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Women's_freestyle_48_kg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling at the 2014 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's freestyle 48 kg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contact sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08-07/3y24hw88/FotoJet - 2024-08-07T150853.932.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797505", "eventUri": "eng-9797505", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 225039962, "title": "Kenneth Jeyaretnam issued seventh POFMA order over comment on High Court judges' bonuses", "text": "SINGAPORE: Reform Party leader Kenneth Jeyaretnam was issued a correction direction under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) on Wednesday (May 29) after he alleged that the Prime Minister and Law Minister can influence the size of performance bonuses paid to specific High Court judges. Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong, who is also Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, instructed the POFMA Office to issue the order to Mr Jeyaretnam, the Ministry of Law said in a media release. This is the seventh POFMA order that Mr Jeyaretnam has received, with the preceding six linked to his comments about the rental of black-and-white bungalows at Ridout Road by two ministers. The latest order is tied to the defamation claims filed by the two ministers \u2013 Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam and Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan \u2013 against Mr Lee Hsien Yang over comments he made about their rental of the state properties. Last week a High Court judge ordered Mr Lee, the brother of former Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, to pay S$200,000 (US$ 148,000) in damages to Mr Shanmugam and Dr Balakrishnan for defaming them. In a Facebook post on May 25, Mr Jeyaretnam questioned the judge's decision to award damages to the ministers and alleged that Mr Shanmugam as Law Minister \"may have some input, along with the Prime Minister, into the appointment and promotion of High Court judges and into the size of their performance bonuses\". An article on the government's fact-checking website Factually said that this is untrue. \"Under Article 98(6) of the Constitution, the legislature shall by law provide for the remuneration of the Supreme Court judges,\" the article said. \"The Judges' Remuneration Act 1994 sets out the framework for the salaries, allowances and privileges accorded to Supreme Court judges as a class. The annual pensionable salary of Supreme Court judges as a class is fixed by law.\" The High Court is part of the Supreme Court. \"It is the Chief Justice who then determines the salary and bonuses to be paid to each Supreme Court judge, within the scope of the framework set out in law,\" the article continued. \"Neither the Prime Minister nor any Minister can determine or influence the payments to be made to specific judges under this framework.\" The article also highlighted that the Constitution prohibits the alteration of a Supreme Court judge's terms of office, including remuneration, to their disadvantage after their appointment. \"Mr Jeyaretnam's allegation is thus false,\" the article said. Mr Jeyaretnam has added a correction notice to his Facebook post \u2013 as required by the POFMA order \u2013 stating that it contains a false statement of fact and directing readers to the government's clarifications on Factually.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/kenneth-jeyaretnam-seventh-pofma-correction-direction-high-court-judges-bonuses-ridout-road-4371281", "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--8j8RP6GM--/c_crop,h_405,w_720,x_0,y_1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/05/29/240968167_382876380069480_515407874319100007_n.jpg?itok=NYde66YT", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:44:12", "author": "Cna", "authors": ["Cna"], "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": -0.089}

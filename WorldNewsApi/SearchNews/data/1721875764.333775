When Kim tee\u2019d off, Young\u2019s name was right with his atop the leaderboard. The 27-year-old from Scarborough, N.Y. scorched the course, soft after the storm that delayed the second round on Friday, and put together a round at 11-under 59 that was one shot shy of the tournament\u2019s 18-hole scoring record, set by Jim Furyk in the 2016 final round. There have been 13 sub-60 rounds in the history of the PGA Tour. Twelve players with 59 and Furyk\u2019s 58. Scottie Scheffler was the last to post the magic number, in 2020 at the TPC Boston. \u201cThe last two days have been great. I played some really nice golf,\u201d Young said. \u201cI think in terms of lifetime achievement, there\u2019s definitely some things that go before it for me. It\u2019s one day, it\u2019s one day that you shot a million under. It\u2019s very cool and I\u2019m thankful that my name is on that very short list, but there\u2019s whole tournaments that I\u2019ve played that I probably would still put above it.\u201d Young shot 2-over 72 in the first round Thursday and followed that with a 4-under 66 on Friday to get to 2-under 138 through 36 holes. With five birdies and an eagle on the front nine, Young recorded a career-best nine-hole score of 7-under 28, one shy of Furyk\u2019s nine-hole record 8-under 27 in that record final round. Bogey-free for the day, Young recorded birdie on No. 13 and 17 with an eagle on the par-3 15th hole following a 280-yard drive that landed four feet from the cup. He had to scramble on the final hole, however, to post the historic number. Young\u2019s tee shot went left, just missing a bunker and leaving a severe uphill lie for his second shot. He came up short of the green and pitched up leaving a putt of about nine feet which he made for par. Young hit just 6 of 14 fairways (42.86%) but reached 15 of 18 greens in regulation during the round. Kim, in the final group alongside Collin Morikawa at 11-under, teed off at 2 p.m.", "summary": "Cameron Young climbed to the top of the leaderboard shooting 11-under 59 in Saturday's third round of the Travelers Championship.", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/06/22/cameron-young-shoots-a-magic-59-one-shot-shy-of-jim-furyks-travelers-championship-scoring-record/", "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Travelers-Championship-Golf.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:11:32", "author": "Joe Arruda", "authors": ["Joe Arruda"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.16}

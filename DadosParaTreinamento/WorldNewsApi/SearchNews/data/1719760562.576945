{"id": 225010890, "title": "Alleged Child Network Leaders Arrested After $2 Million Thefts", "text": "Police say they have busted a child network tasked with stealing more than $2 million worth of cash and cigarettes in Melbourne to avoid adults \u201cgetting their hands dirty\u201d. Victoria Police on Wednesday evening (May 29) announced the arrests of four men followed a months-long investigation, with children as young as 12 allegedly recruited into the network. The more than 20 children\u2014the eldest of whom was 17\u2014were behind more than 140 cigarette burglaries and armed robberies in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs since January, police allege. The children allegedly targeted service stations, supermarkets and tobacconists to come away with a cumulative haul worth more than $2 million (US$1.33 million) \u201cPolice will allege that for as little as a couple of hundred dollars, these children have been enticed into stealing millions of dollars of cigarettes and cash from service stations, supermarkets, and tobacconists,\u201d Eastern region regional crime advisor Acting Inspector Dale Maxwell said. \u201cChildren as young as 12 have allegedly been recruited by adults\u2019 intent on lining their own pockets without getting their hands dirty. \u201cThese adults are intentionally preying on youth to offend on their behalf in the misguided hope they won\u2019t be linked to the offending while they profit substantially.\u201d Mr. Maxwell said police identified a sophisticated network of child offenders carrying out serious and violent crimes on behalf of adults. More than 40 per cent of the children were already known to police for sneaking into homes and stealing cars for joyrides, officers said. Police arrested two 19-year-old men who they alleged recruited the more than 20 children to target suburbs including Blackburn, Balwyn, Boroondara, Burwood, Clayton, Camberwell, Doncaster East, Hawthorn, Lilydale, Oakleigh, and Somerville. The two men\u2014one from Burwood, and the other from Ferntree Gully\u2014had links to youth gangs and were the ringleaders of the operation, officers alleged. Police also arrested two cigarette vendors, aged 33 from Burwood and 53 from Silvan, who they alleged the cigarettes were on-sold to. As part of officers\u2019 investigations, they seized cigarettes and vapes, more than $243,000 cash from the 33-year-old Burwood man\u2019s home and more than 200 cannabis plants and weapons. Police executed 16 search warrants on Wednesday and, along with the four men, arrested three more adults and a 15-year-old boy for other matters. Officers arrested 38 people in connection with the 140 cigarette burglaries before May 28. Among them, they arrested five children on April 17.", "summary": "'These children have been enticed into stealing millions of dollars of cigarettes and cash from service stations, supermarkets, and tobacconists.'", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/alleged-child-network-leaders-arrested-after-2-million-thefts-5658809", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/18/id5631927-GettyImages-460699410-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:12:06", "author": "AAP", "authors": ["AAP"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.054}

A chance to get to a first final not held in England - first time England will have ever done that.\n\n\"We're trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated, but the players have responded brilliantly and resilience has been built.\"\n\nThat strength was needed during the early stages of the tournament in Germany, where frustrated England fans greeted the end of the group draws against Denmark and Slovenia with boos.\n\nSome beer cups were even aimed Southgate's way after the latter stalemate in Cologne, where he warned the \"unusual environment\" around them was making life harder for the players.\n\nHigh-profile criticism from former internationals like Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer added to the background noise, which all combined to have a negative impact on the team.\n\n\"There's been a definite shift,\" Southgate said on the eve of the Signal Iduna Park showdown. \"I was really interested (because) as a coach sometimes you take a step back and you observe.\n\n\"One of the strengths of us over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition.\n\n\"But I think at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed quite heavily and of course the external noise was louder than it's ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and, in the end, what was impressive was that the players ground it out, they ground results out and found ways to win.\n\n\"I felt that shifted once we got into the knockout stage and definitely in the quarter-final. I thought we saw a better version of us with the ball, freer.\n\n\"I'm not sure any of the messaging changed, but I just felt the group changed.\"\n\nPushed on inhibition earlier in the tournament, the England boss said: \"For me, that's been a fascinating experience to see the team have been fearful in the opening part of it. Almost concerned about what could go wrong.\n\n\"We haven't had that for a few years. Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well.\n\n\"But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset.\n\n\"I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into the game tomorrow.\"\n\nSouthgate says his squad now want to \"use the opportunity to change history as a motivation\" after overcoming a sense of fear.\n\n\"I think we were definitely open about it, because I think when you can sense that feeling you need to confront it,\" the England boss added.\n\n\"It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away.\n\n\"In the end we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch. The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the players looking distraught. They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying.\n\n\"Every other team was celebrating with their fans at that and we were on our knees, so I had to correct how they were viewing things.\n\n\"But of course that feeling was being reinforced so vocally and actively outside and I think they were picking up on that too much.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_peach@aol.co.uk", "name": "Simon Peach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2ZJE_Ht8n4GS_0sFiEjDUQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_press_association_sport_600/0f805bb37825bb5b3ee4b2fef2e6888b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Almost concerned about what could go wrong.\n\n\"We haven't had that for a few years. Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well.\n\n\"But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset.\n\n\"I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into the game tomorrow.\"\n\nSouthgate says his squad now want to \"use the opportunity to change history as a motivation\" after overcoming a sense of fear.\n\nThe Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the players looking distraught.

Rather than, 'what might go wrong?' That's different for a player or athlete.\n\n\"This is now a chance to make history, which we've enjoyed doing. It's a chance to get to a first European Championship final not held in England, it's the first time England will have ever done that.\n\n\"We are trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated but the players have responded brilliantly. You can bond over the resilience that has been built.\n\n\"We've been very fortunate. We've had Ed Sheeran in to sing and it was great. The players had a couple of beers before the last game.\n\n\"You can bond in that way but when you're having to head the ball out of your box in the 92nd minute and you're trying to find a goal in the 96th minute, there's nothing stronger than that for building the spirit of the team.\"\n\nKane: We have handled the noise well\n\nCaptain Harry Kane agreed with his manager, saying: \"I think we do a good job of preparing the players before the tournament for what tournament football is like.\n\n\"You have to perform well but there's more to it. You're away with one another for a long time. The preparation, lots of time in the hotel, lots of media attention. It's about dealing with all of it.\n\n\"Over the years under Gareth, we've handled that well and this tournament has been no different. The expectation has been bigger and the noise a bit louder, but we've handled it well.\n\n\"Some use it as motivation, some will block it out. We have a close togetherness with the staff and players - all in the same direction.\"\n\nKane's form has been heavily scrutinised during England's run to the last four, despite goals against Denmark and Slovakia, but he is expected to keep his place against the Netherlands and the former Tottenham striker is relishing another battle with Virgil van Dijk.\n\n\"We've had some really good battles over the years at Southampton and Liverpool - lots of big games,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes he's won the battle, sometimes I've won it. It will be a tough game - a tough opponent. I'll prepare to make his life as uncomfortable as possible and he'll do the same to me.\n\n\"I enjoy playing against the best players in the world.\"\n\nSouthgate coy on starting Shaw\n\nThe biggest question mark around team selection concerns whether Southgate will include Luke Shaw, who appeared as a substitute against Switzerland following his long-awaited return from injury, but the England boss insists no decision has been made.\n\n\"He made a good contribution [vs Switzerland],\" he said. \"That's a decision we have to make, whether he's ready to start.\n\n\"We're happy to have him back. He gives us balance.\n\n\"But Kieran Trippier has done a fantastic job - he's played in so many important nights for us over the last seven or eight years. But also around the squad and how he is.

After all, the men's team is within one win of getting to back-to-back European Championship finals and of reaching the title match at a major tournament for the first time outside England.\n\nYet, Southgate said the pressure and \"noise\" was much higher on the players earlier in the tournament.\n\nEngland came to Euro 2024 with what many regarded as their strongest squad for 20 years, only to limp through the group stage, require an equaliser in the fifth minute of stoppage time before getting past Slovakia in the last 16 and then need a penalty-shootout win over Switzerland to advance from the quarter-finals.\n\n\"One of the strengths of us over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition,\" Southgate said at a pre-match news conference in Dortmund. \"But I think at the beginning of the tournament, expectation weighed quite heavily and of course the external noise was louder than it has ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place.

Southgate has been facing the heat from fans and pundits for their over-cautious approach in major tournaments in the recent past. England winning their first major title in 58 years might help Southgate prove his naysayers wrong and become an idol in English football history.\n\nAfter overseeing a thrilling win over the Netherlands in the semi-final, Southgate said he was thrilled to give the fans a moment like Wednesday evening to celebrate. Southgate was uncharacteristically emotional after the final whistle was blown in Dortmund as he let out a roar and wore a big smile on his face throughout the evening.\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right? When you're doing something for your country and you're a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back and when all you read is criticism, it's hard. So to be able to celebrate the second final is very, very special,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were. We are kindred spirits in many ways but of course, I'm the one who has to pick a team. So to be able to give them a night like tonight, it's very special.\"\n\nEngland will take on unbeaten Spain in their first-ever away final in the Euros. Southgate's men battled back from behind in their semi-final. Xavi Simmons's stunning strike gave the Netherlands the lead in the 7th minute. However, England equalised through a controversial penalty from Harry Kane. Just when it looked like the two teams would need the extra 30 minutes, substitute Ollie Watkins scored a screamer in the 91st minute to seal the win.\n\nSouthgate soaked in the adulation of the traveling fans in an emotional moment. It has been a turnaround of sorts for the English tactician. Cups were thrown at Southgate from the stands after England's 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stage. England have progressed to the final after having some laboured wins -- 1-0 win over Slovakia and win on penalties against Switzerland.\n\nSouthgate is aware that England need to raise their game against Spain, who have been arguably the best team of the tournament. Spain came back from behind to beat France 2-1 in the semi-final in Munich on Tuesday.\n\n\"The only reason I took the job was to try and bring success to England as a nation and try and improve English football. To be able to take the team to its first final overseas, I'm immensely proud of that,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"We play the team who have been the best team in the tournament and we have a day less to prepare so it's a huge task. But we're still here and we're fighting.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/gareth-southgate-112435669-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=gIEgJnA8R4xEwInLPPsgtOCeoH4QmvhR", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 280, "textEnd": 287}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

A chance to get to a first final not held in England - first time England will have ever done that.\n\n\"We're trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated, but the players have responded brilliantly and resilience has been built.\"\n\nThat strength was needed during the early stages of the tournament in Germany, where frustrated England fans greeted the end of the group draws against Denmark and Slovenia with boos.\n\nSome beer cups were even aimed Southgate's way after the latter stalemate in Cologne, where he warned the \"unusual environment\" around them was making life harder for the players.\n\nHigh-profile criticism from former internationals like Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer added to the background noise, which all combined to have a negative impact on the team.\n\n\"There's been a definite shift,\" Southgate said on the eve of the Signal Iduna Park showdown. \"I was really interested (because) as a coach sometimes you take a step back and you observe.\n\n\"One of the strengths of us over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition.\n\n\"But I think at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed quite heavily and of course the external noise was louder than it's ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and, in the end, what was impressive was that the players ground it out, they ground results out and found ways to win.\n\n\"I felt that shifted once we got into the knockout stage and definitely in the quarter-final. I thought we saw a better version of us with the ball, freer.\n\n\"I'm not sure any of the messaging changed, but I just felt the group changed.\"\n\nPushed on inhibition earlier in the tournament, the England boss said: \"For me, that's been a fascinating experience to see the team have been fearful in the opening part of it. Almost concerned about what could go wrong.\n\n\"We haven't had that for a few years. Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well.\n\n\"But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset.\n\n\"I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into the game tomorrow.\"\n\nSouthgate says his squad now want to \"use the opportunity to change history as a motivation\" after overcoming a sense of fear.\n\n\"I think we were definitely open about it, because I think when you can sense that feeling you need to confront it,\" the England boss added.\n\n\"It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away.\n\n\"In the end we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch.

Is there a reason? Is it his fitness? Is it not?'.\n\n\"But like I said before the tournament, I felt like I had a good preparation going into it, I'm getting better and sharper as the games go along.\n\n\"We have a semi-final ahead of us and of course I'd love nothing more than to score a couple of goals and get through to the final.\"\n\nWatch England v Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semi-finals on Wednesday from 7pm on RT\u00c92 and RT\u00c9 Player.

Credit to Southgate, I've been very negative about him all tournament but getting this team to a second Euro final in a row deserves some credit.\"\n\nFormer Crystal Palace owner Jordan doubled down on his view of Southgate and doesn't think much of him as a manager.\n\n\"So in context, having the most wonderful draws in every single tournament that he has been, being an average manager, I think is a fair assessment.\n\n\"When you get an opportunity to win things, when you get the draws that we've had, you can only beat who is in front of you, there is no criticism of beating what's in front of you.\n\n\"If you get Serbia, Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia and Switzerland and a very average Dutch side as your passage to a final, every single manager in the world of a significant footballing nation would say 'I'll have that all day'.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callum_vurley@talksport.com", "name": "Callum Vurley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Warnock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Agbonlahor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Agbonlahor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/RAS-TALKSPORT-OFF-PLATFORM-SOUTHGATE-ENGLAND.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

EUROS DAILY: Should we trust England's referee against the Netherlands after his 'match-fixing' conviction?\n\nGareth Southgate says there has been a shift in England's mindset ahead of their semi-final with Netherlands, after revealing his players were 'weighed down' by expectation and external noise earlier in the tournament.\n\nSuccess here in Dortmund on Wednesday night would put the Three Lions in the final of a major tournament for the first time overseas. Their passage to the last four has not been easy, and their 1-0 win over Serbia in the opening group match remains their only victory inside normal time.\n\nThere has been stinging criticism and fierce debate around the team and its below-par performances, but Southgate senses a change in mood among his squad.\n\n'There has been a definite shift (in mindset since start of tournament),' he said. 'Sometimes, as a coach, you take a step back and observe. One of our strengths over the past seven or eight years has been less fear and less inhibition.\n\n'But I think at the beginning of the tournament the expectation weighed quite heavily. The external noise was louder than it's ever been. We couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place.'\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate (right) and captain Harry Kane (left) pictured checking on the pitch at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on the eve of Wednesday's clash with the Netherlands\n\nSouthgate said at a press conference on Tuesday that his team played 'freer' in their last game\n\nEngland's players looked relaxed as the geared up for their semi-final contest at Euro 2024\n\n'What was impressive in the end was that we ground it out and found ways to win. I thought that shifted against the Swiss, you saw a freer version of us on the ball. Now it's that moment in the tournament where it's about what is possible and not what might go wrong. This now is the chance to make history by making the first final outside of England.'\n\nSouthgate also revealed that his players were allowed a beer ahead of the quarter-final tie with Switzerland, but insists there is no substitute for building camaraderie on the pitch.\n\n'We had Ed Sheeran in to sing and that was great, and the players had a couple of beers before the last game,' he said. 'You can bond in that way. But when you're having to head the ball out your box in the 92nd minute or having to find a goal in the 96th minute, there is nothing stronger than that for building the spirit of the team.'\n\nMeanwhile, Harry Kane appeared to confirm he will start against the Dutch. There have been some calls for the captain to be dropped after a string of poor displays.\n\nKane (centre) is expected to start on Wednesday despite being subbed off against Switzerland\n\nAnthony Gordon, who has only received a few minutes of game time, looked sharp in training\n\nEberechi Eze (left) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (right) both looked very focussed on Tuesday\n\nHowever, speaking alongside Southgate at Signal Iduna Park on Tuesday night, the striker said: 'There will be times tomorrow where I'll need to be more of a focal point and in the box more and there will be times where I drop deep and try to make it uncomfortable for defenders in situations they don't want to be in.\n\n'As the striker you want to give as much space as possible to the midfielders, but then there's times you want to drag defenders into spaces they might not want to come either.

Both games were played in London at Wembley.\n\nA place in Sunday's decider against either France or Spain awaits after a tournament in which England were widely tipped as one of the pre-tournament favourites but produced a series of underwhelming performances, requiring extra-time to beat Slovakia and then penalties to edge past Switzerland at the quarterfinal stage.\n\nAsked if he feels England are now ready to peak at the climax of Euro 2024, Southgate said: \"There's been a definite shift. I was really interested [because] as a coach sometimes you take a step back and you observe.\n\n\"One of the strengths of us over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition. But I think at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed quite heavily and of course the external noise was louder than it's ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and, in the end, what was impressive was that the players ground it out, they ground results out and found ways to win.\n\n\"I felt that shifted once we got into the knockout stage and definitely in the quarter-final. I thought we saw a better version of us with the ball, freer.\n\n\"I'm not sure any of the messaging changed but I just felt the group changed. You're now into that moment in the tournament where it's 'what's possible, what's achievable', rather than 'what might go wrong'.\n\n\"That's different for players, for an athlete. So, this is now the chance to make history, which we've enjoyed doing that, a chance to get to a first final not held in England - the first time England will have ever done that.\n\n\"We're trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated, but the players have responded brilliantly and the resilience that's been built.\"\n\nSouthgate referenced the team bonding exercises which included singer Ed Sheeran playing a 30-minute acoustic set at the team's training base near Blankenhain the day after England beat Slovakia and allowing the players to consume alcohol.\n\n\"You can bond and we've been very fortunate that we've had Ed Sheeran in to sing and it was great,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"The players had a couple of beers before the last game. You can bond in that way but when you're having to head the ball out your box in the 92nd minute and you're having to find a goal in the 96th minute there's nothing stronger than that for building the spirit of a team.\"\n\nSouthgate also insisted he had no concerns over Uefa's decision to select Felix Zwayer to officiate Wednesday's semifinal despite the German official once being criticised by Jude Bellingham for a match-fixing conviction.\n\nIn 2021, then-Borussia Dortmund midfielder Bellingham questioned Zwayer's integrity after taking charge of Bayern's 3-2 win over Dortmund and he was subsequently fined \u20ac40,000.\n\nBellingham said \"you give a referee that has match fixed before the biggest game in Germany, what do you expect\" in reference to Zwayer's 2005 conviction for accepting a \u20ac300 bribe to favour SV Wuppertal in a match against Werder Bremen Amateure.\n\nQuestioned on whether he had any fears over Zwayer's appointment or felt the need to speak to Bellingham, Southgate said: \"No. I think everybody knows how I deal with referees: with complete respect for every referee.\n\n\"I know the two guys at Uefa, Roberto [Rosetti] and Bjorn [Kuipers], who've been running the referees programme and I think they appreciate the respect we've shown to the officials as a team over the past eight years.\n\n\"I think there is a right way to conduct yourself towards officials. I think that's very important for the image of the game. So, no, I'm not concerned about who the referee is. \"He will be at the very highest standard because that's the way Uefa make those decisions and the way they monitor the games during the tournament. For me, it is not even a consideration.\"\n\nSouthgate could hand Luke Shaw his first start for club or country since February after the Manchester United defender finally returned from a hamstring problem to play the final 42 minutes against Switzerland.\n\n\"He made a good contribution to the game, so that's the decision we have to make - whether he's ready to start, whether that's the best way to use him,\" Southgate added.\n\n\"But we're very happy to have him back. He obviously gives us balance, a different balance with the team.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_olley@espn.com.sg", "name":

He's received plenty of criticism over the years and admitted he finds it hard. If Southgate secures Euro win, he'll solidify his legacy as England's greatest coach, achieving unprecedented success.\n\nGareth Southgate has done it again. The England manager has taken the Three Lions to a European Championship final for the second tournament in a row. The success means a lot to him too, as was shown through his very emotional interview after the match which has gone viral.\n\nThe former player has now become the first manager to take England to multiple major tournament finals, but he's had his critics over the years. The Three Lions haven't looked great throughout Euro 2024, and have actually gone behind in all three of their knockout games so far. As a result, Southgate has taken some flack from fans and pundits alike.\n\nRelated Netherlands 1-2 England: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nEngland are through to the final of EURO 2024 thanks to a late winner from Ollie Watkins.\n\nAs he did three years ago, though, he's taken England to the final and will be hoping his team can go one further this time around. Regardless of the result, the fact his team have gotten to the final again is a magnificent achievement and Southgate wore his heart on his sleeve when discussing things after they beat the Netherlands 2-1.\n\nSouthgate Spoke About the Criticism He's Received He admitted that he finds it hard\n\nWhile he's been England manager for six years now, Southgate is still only human, and he deals with things the same as anyone else. He made that clear during his post-match interview when he spoke about the amount of criticism that he's received recently and admitted that he finds it hard when it comes from people he's trying to do right by.\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right? So, when you're doing something for your country, and you're a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back, when all you read is criticism, it's hard.\n\n\"To be able to celebrate a second final is very, very special. It means a lot.\"\n\nIt's clear just how much it means to the manager and while there has been a fair share of criticism aimed at him and his tactics, no one can ever doubt just how passionate he is about being the England manager.\n\nSouthgate's Legacy is Unmatched A Euro win would make him England's greatest manager\n\nHe hasn't always been the most popular man, and at times it feels like there are more England fans who want Southgate gone than there are who want him in charge of the Three Lions, but there's no denying the incredible tenure he's had as boss. Before he took charge, the nation hadn't reached the semi-final in a major tournament in decades, and now they've done that three times in six years.\n\nHe's the first boss to take the country to two major tournament finals and if he manages to finally get his hands on the European Championship on Sunday when they play Spain, he'll go down as England's greatest ever coach.

He has trained for his moment no matter how frustrated.\"\n\n\"They had each others' back, they bonded so well and tonight it was an example of that.\"\n\nEngland needed penalties to overcome Switzerland in the last eight before the late winner on Wednesday.\n\nSouthgate said his team had learned from knockout matches since the 2018 World Cup in Russia where they lost in the semi-finals to Croatia.\n\n\"We are more calm going into the knockout games. In Russia we had not won a knockout game in 10 years,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"To be able to take the team to the first final overseas I am immensely proud of that,\" he said.\n\nEngland won the 1966 World Cup on home soil while the Euro 2020 final was also held at Wembley.\n\nThey will now face the form team of the tournament Spain, who have won all their matches in Germany.\n\n\"We will have to get the ball off them first,\" Southgate said of their next opponents.\n\n\"It is not as simple as us having the ball and making them run. We have to be exceptional with the ball and without it. They have been the best team.\"\n\n\"We are starting to show a better version of ourselves,\" he said, adding they had one less day than Spain, who beat France on Tuesday in their semi-final, to prepare.\n\n\"But we are in there with what we have shown to this point.

I mean, they press very, very well, so we're going to have to be exceptional with the ball, and we're going to have to be exceptional without it.\n\n\"But it's a final, you expect it to be that way. They've been the best team. We're starting to show a better version of ourselves.\n\n\"The extra day is a concern. You know, in the last few tournaments that's been a problem for finalists, so we've got to do the very best we can to recover the players as well as we can.\n\n\"But we're not going to be on the training ground. That's simple. We'll be walking through things or delivering things in meetings, which was the same for this game.\n\n\"But we're in there and with what we've shown to this point we have as good a chance as they do.\"\n\nSpain are the bookmakers' favourites to triumph in Berlin, where Southgate will attempt to mastermind England men's first continental crown having fallen agonisingly short in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nEngland's squad has a new look to it nowadays but the core from the Italy defeat remains, with Southgate utilising that experience as the group quickly refocuses on Spain.\n\n\"The lads are singing in the dressing room, but they're straight in the ice,\" he said with a laugh after the Signal Iduna Park semi-final.\n\n\"There won't be any wild parties. We've had a couple of those already, so we pick our moments for those.\n\n\"But in terms of the experience, of course every game you manage, every tournament you manage, you learn so much.\n\n\"When I took this job I'd had three years as a Premier League manager. I've now had 100 internationals, some of the biggest games in world football. You learn all the time from that.\n\n\"We're more calm going into the knockout games because the first time we did it in Russia (at the 2018 World Cup) we hadn't won a knockout game for 10 years.\n\n\"We hadn't been through the experience - quarter-finals, semi-finals, you know, we've managed a lot of those games now, so you're definitely much better prepared because every experience you go through you learn from.\n\n\"You're improving all the time, your knowledge, your understanding, so I would say if you're a coach and you're not doing that there'd be a problem, really.\n\n\"But the last final was the first final, first European Championship final, I'd ever managed, so if I didn't get everything right apologies for that but we'll try and do better this week.\"\n\nEngland returned to their Blankenhain base after Wednesday's Dortmund triumph to rest, recover and refocus on their toughest test yet.\n\nSouthgate said Harry Kane \"took quite a big knock when he won the penalty\" he converted shortly after Xavi Simons slammed the Dutch ahead, but played on until Watkins replaced him in the 81st minute.\n\nThe England manager also said full-back Kieran Trippier \"had a little bit of a problem\", leading them to expedite the decision to bring on Luke Shaw at half-time.\n\nSouthgate hopes Trippier \"could be OK\" for Sunday, adding: \"We didn't want to take any chances and we had it in our minds that bringing Luke into the game with that balance at some point.\n\n\"We're still deciding how long he could play for, but we felt to be able to bring him into the game and finish with that balance was better than to start it and then have to take him off.\n\n\"We'll have to see how our Tripps is but, I mean, he's been an absolute soldier for us.\n\n\"To fill in the way he has and produce the level of performance on the wrong side of the pitch with the injuries he came into the tournament with as well has been absolutely phenomenal.\"", "source": {"uri":

He obviously gives us balance, a different balance with the team.\n\n\"But also Kieran (Trippier) has done a fantastic job. He's played in so many important nights for us.\"\n\nSouthgate has been criticised for his team's style despite getting this far and the manager revealed the negative mood around the team impacted the players during the group stage.\n\n\"There's been a definite shift,\" the England boss said.\n\n\"I was really interested (because) as a coach sometimes you take a step back and you observe.\n\n\"One of the strengths of us over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition.\n\n\"But I think at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed quite heavily and of course the external noise was louder than it's ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and, in the end, what was impressive was that the players ground it out, they ground results out and found ways to win.\n\n\"I felt that shifted once we got into the knockout stage and definitely in the quarter-final. I thought we saw a better version of us with the ball, freer.\n\n\"I'm not sure any of the messaging changed, but I just felt the group changed.\n\n\"You're now into that moment in the tournament where it's what's possible, what's achievable, rather than what might go wrong.\n\n\"This is now the chance to make history, which we've enjoyed doing.\n\n\"A chance to get to a first final not held in England - first time England will have ever done that.\n\n\"We're trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated, but the players have responded brilliantly and resilience has been built.\n\n\"You can bond and we've been very fortunate that we've had Ed Sheeran in to sing and it was great, the players had a couple of beers before the last game.\n\n\"You can bond in that way, but when you're having to head the ball out your box in the 92nd minute and you're having to find a goal in the 96th minute, there's nothing stronger than that for building the spirit of a team.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_fordham@talksport.com", "name": "Josh Fordham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talksport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talksport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/DK-TALKSPORT-SHAW.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1500&h=1000&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

After being dominated in a first half that ended tied at 1-1, Dutch boss Ronald Koeman changed his approach at half-time, sending on Wout Weghorst, closing up the spaces Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Kobbie Mainoo had been exploiting and asked a different question of England and Southgate.\n\nFor a while, it flummoxed them. England had nine shots in Wednesday's 2-1 win but none between the 41st minute and 87th. Southgate waited a long time before making his move.\n\nMemories of Croatia in 2018, France in 2022 and even the previous Euros final in between -- which England lost on penalties -- began to resurface as Southgate seemed unable to reverse the momentum ebbing away from his side.\n\nThe conversations he has on the touchline with trusted assistant Steve Holland can seem interminable. There is no doubt other managers are more proactive, instinctive even.\n\nBut having been largely forced into bringing on Luke Shaw at half-time as Kieran Trippier suffered a groin problem that makes him a doubt for Sunday's final, Southgate's double change with 10 minutes to go was, eventually, bold.\n\nHarry Kane is England's all-time leading goal scorer and captain, but despite scoring the first-half penalty that cancelled out Xavi Simons' sublime opener, he was flatfooted, tired and far too easy to mark. Southgate suggested afterward that the Denzel Dumfries challenge on Kane, which led to his penalty, had left a mark on the forward.\n\nFoden was also caught in the wider malaise but had been so dangerous in the first half, having a shot cleared off the line before hitting the post from long range. Taking them both off for Ollie Watkins and Cole Palmer was not an easy call given their reputations and standings, but it was the right one.\n\nPalmer fired over in the 88th minute but then played a clever pass through for Watkins, who turned Stefan de Vrij and fired a stunning shot across Dutch goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen and just inside his right-hand post. Cue pandemonium.\n\nSomewhere in the maelstrom, Southgate reacted by introducing Conor Gallagher and Ezri Konsa to see out stoppage-time and spark more jubilant scenes at full-time. After allowing the players to take centre stage in front of the euphoric England supporters, Southgate took a moment to celebrate passionately in front of them.\n\nGareth Southgate's 81st-minute substitutions sparked England to a late Euro 2024 semifinal win over the Netherlands on Wednesday. Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nThis is a tournament campaign that has been blighted by fitness issues from the outset and heavy criticism from supporters throughout. Now, beer was being thrown in the air, not at Southgate.\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right? When you are doing something for your country and you are a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back and all you read is criticism, it is hard,\" Southgate said after the match. \"To be able to celebrate a second final is very, very special. Especially the fans that travel.\n\n\"Our travelling support is amazing, the money they spend, the commitment to do that, to be able to give them a night like this -- and we have given them a few over the last six years from Russia onwards -- it means a lot. If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were.\n\n\"We're kindred spirits in many ways. Of course, I'm the one that has to pick a team. To be able to give them a night like tonight is very, very special.\"\n\nEngland's opening 45 minutes was the best football they have produced all tournament. Admittedly, the bar for that was pretty low after a series of underwhelming displays, but there was an energy and dynamism about them after Simons' superb seventh-minute strike put the Netherlands in front.\n\nKane's equaliser came from a penalty that could only really have been awarded in the VAR era, but England were good value for it until the Netherlands shut the game down, making this a similar watch to England's stifled displays against Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia and Switzerland in particular.\n\n\"They were a three-box-three in the second half so we weren't able to be quite as incisive in the second half but we kept the ball really well and made them run,\" Southgate said. \"Maybe in the end, that's the bit that's fatigued them and has been critical in the goal that we scored. There was a lot going on in the game. In the end, it is the players who make the decisions on the pitch, and they did it brilliantly.\"\n\nOf course, the cycle will only truly be broken if England can go all the way and win their first major men's honour since 1966. This is not a vintage Netherlands side and England have, once again, benefitted from a kinder half of the draw. Final opponents Spain look in the sort of form to give England by some distance their toughest match this summer.\n\nSouthgate was asked about the prospect of beating Spain. \"We'll have to get the ball off them first,\" began his reply.\n\nBut having scrambled for answers all tournament -- changing Declan Rice's midfield partner three times, switching systems from a back four to a three-man defence -- Southgate came up with the game-changing moment when it really mattered.\n\nIt may be a one-off. Criticisms of him will remain, despite a tournament record that now reads: semifinal, final, quarterfinal, final. But England are now in a position where Southgate only needs to be right one more time to achieve immortality.", "source": {"uri": "hiiraan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hiiraan Online"},

Maybe that was the added expectation - but now they're very much in a 'what's achievable? what's possible?' sort of mindset.\n\n\"Sometimes, as a coach, you take a step back and observe. One of the strengths of us over the last eight years has been having less fear, less inhibition.\n\n\"But at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed quite heavily and the external noise was louder than it has ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and in the end, what was impressive was that the players found a way to grind out results.\n\n\"That shifted once we got into the quarter-final, we saw a better version of ourselves with the ball, we were freer.\"\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nSouthgate has tried music and booze to help his players bond - but says there is no better way to instil team spirit than scoring dramatic late goals, like Jude Bellingham's equaliser against Slovakia, or stoically defending a lead.\n\nHe said: \"We had Ed Sheeran in to sing and it was great. The players had a couple of beers before the last game.\n\n\"You can bond in that way but when you are having to head the ball out of the box in the 92nd minute and to try to find a goal in the 96th minute, there is nothing stronger than that for building the spirit of a team.\"\n\nIt was quite some admission from Southgate to state that his players had been fearful - given that his entire eight-year reign had been built on sweeping away the toxic culture which made quality players terrified of representing their country.\n\nThe England boss says he was quick to jump on the problem by urging his players to have more perspective.\n\nSouthgate said: \"We definitely spoke about it (the fear). When you can sense that feeling you need to confront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away.\n\n\"After the Denmark game, there's a picture of the players looking distraught.\n\n\"They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying. Every other team was celebrating with their fans at that point and we were on our knees.\n\n\"So I had to correct how they were viewing things. That feeling was being reinforced so vocally and actively outside and they were picking up on that too much.\"\n\nSouthgate says England have had to adapt since his first campaign in charge, at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, when a single knock-out victory, over Colombia on penalties, was considered a success.\n\nEngland have now reached three tournament semi-finals under Southgate - as many as they had achieved in their entire history up until 2016.\n\nAnd Southgate said: \"I suppose in Russia winning a knock-out game was the first target and it felt from that moment on, the change of mindset was there.\n\n\"Because we've gone further in more recent tournaments,nobody is thinking a quarter-final is anywhere near enough.\n\n\"Now we're in the real business end of the tournament - which given our history, is not to be underestimated.\n\n\"But the great thing is we're not sitting here happy with a semi-final, we want to go further. Our aim is to come here and win it and we're now two games away from doing that.\"\n\nWhile England's display in the quarter-final victory over Switzerland was an improvement on the shambolic last-16 clash with Slovakia, Southgate is still being heavily criticised for his side's lack of entertainment value.\n\nThe clash with the Dutch is likely to be a more open contest, with Ronald Koeman's side having scored nine goals and looking far less defensively-minded than England's previous five opponents.\n\nSouthgate played in the 4-1 victory over the Netherlands at Euro 96, widely regarded as England's finest tournament performance.\n\nBut he is a lifelong admirer of Dutch football - especially his rival boss, and fellow former centre-half, Koeman.\n\nSouthgate said: \"They played incredible football in the 70 and 80s, they were in two World Cup Finals and won the European Championship. I loved watching the Dutch teams.\n\n\"Ronald Koeman was a player I admired very much.

Reaching the final could rekindle a love affair with the team's supporters.\n\nA coach once idolized by his team's fans -- and with the most consistently successful record of any England manager -- had been the target of a volley of plastic cups from disgruntled fans at one game, and criticism from British TV commentators over his cautious approach.\n\nWednesday's 2-1 win over the Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semifinals might change all that. Southgate's team played a more open, attacking style for much of the game, and his decision to take off captain Harry Kane paid dividends when substitute Ollie Watkins scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner.\n\nREAD: Sparkling Spain reaches Euro 2024 final the hard way\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right? When you're doing something for your country and you're a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back and when all you read is criticism, it's hard. So to be able to celebrate the second final (after Euro 2020) is very, very special,\" Southgate said, paying tribute to England's traveling fans.\n\n\"If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were. We are kindred spirits in many ways but of course I'm the one who has to pick a team. So to be able to give them a night like tonight, it's very special.\"\n\nSouthgate was once seen as someone who reconnected England with its fan base, making them fall back in love with the team.\n\nSupporters sang of Southgate being \"the one\" and the vest - or waistcoat -- he wore at the 2018 World Cup became one of the iconic symbols of his first major tournament in charge.\n\nBut a loss on penalties to Italy at home in the Euro 2020 final seemed for some to show the limits of his cautious tactics as England tried and failed to defend an early 1-0 lead.\n\nREAD: Euro 2024: France sends Ronaldo, Portugal packing on penalties\n\nAt Euro 2024, England's path to its semifinal game against the Netherlands featured some games that were hard to watch -- England didn't have a shot on goal until deep into added time against Slovakia in the round of 16, and the 80th minute against Switzerland in the quarterfinals. Both were crucial goals that kept England's hopes alive.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Southgate's most notable experiment in Germany was one that backfired, deploying right back Trent Alexander-Arnold as a central midfielder in the opening 1-0 win over Serbia and 1-1 draw with Denmark.\n\nEngland faces Spain in Sunday's final, one game away from what would be its first men's trophy since winning the 1966 World Cup on home soil.\n\n\"The only reason I took the job was to try and bring success to England as a nation and try and improve English football. To be able to take the team to its first final overseas, I'm immensely proud of that,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"We play the team who have been the best team in the tournament and we have a day less to prepare so it's a huge task.

a little bit of a problem\", leading them to expedite the decision to bring on Luke Shaw at half-time.\n\nKieran Trippier (right) was replaced by Luke Shaw at half-time against the Netherlands (Nick Potts/PA)\n\nSouthgate hopes Trippier \"could be OK\" for Sunday, adding: \"We didn't want to take any chances and we had it in our minds that bringing Luke into the game with that balance at some point.\n\n\"We're still deciding how long he could play for, but we felt to be able to bring him into the game and finish with that balance was better than to start it and then have to take him off.\n\n\"We'll have to see how our Tripps is but, I mean, he's been an absolute soldier for us.\n\n\"To fill in the way he has and produce the level of performance on the wrong side of the pitch with the injuries he came into the tournament with as well has been absolutely phenomenal.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

So to be able to give them a night like tonight, it's very special.\"\n\ntalkSPORT pundit Jason Cundy was full of praise for Southgate, particularly how he affected the game against the Netherlands.\n\nHe said: \"To change the course of a game and a 90-minute game. Alright, there's gonna be extra time but to turn it in your favour off the bench, let me tell you, mate, that was sensational from Southgate.\n\n\"That was his best performance. He made the right subs at the right time.\n\n\"You can talk about good fortune, Ollie Watkins coming up at that time, there were tired legs and Southgate said it to [talkSPORT reporter] Faye [Carruthers] about if you dominate the ball towards the end of the game, then the pitch will open up.\n\n\"Because there's tired legs out there and you saw that 2 players on the pitch, [Cole] Palmer into Watkins sharp legs, sharp pass, sharp finish goal and that he needs a huge amount of kudos for that Southgate, huge.\"\n\nThe England boss had united a nation at Euro 2020, which was delayed by a year due to Covid and saw the Three Lions reach the final.\n\nThere were gleeful scenes around the country as fans were able to celebrate the summer with lockdown rules lifted and England playing brilliant football.\n\nThis year, the mood has been somewhat gloomy due to the sheer talent in the squad that has yet to translate to the same kind of football seen three years ago.\n\nNevertheless, England are in the Euro 2024 final, having beaten Slovakia, Switzerland and now the Netherlands all in dramatic circumstances.\n\nSouthgate has seen his side go behind in all three contests but show great resilience to get themselves back into the game and go on to win each tie.\n\nIt took a wonder goal from Jude Bellingham to help England beat Slovakia, penalties to defeat the Swiss and now Watkins' brilliant strike to down the Dutch.\n\nSpain awaits on Sunday in Berlin, the team of the tournament so far, who have beaten hosts Germany and also France and Georgia en route to the final,

Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate\n\n\"But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset. I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game [against Switzerland] and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into the game tomorrow.\"\n\nAsked how the players' mindset had changed, Southgate said: \"We definitely spoke about it.\n\n\"When you can sense that feeling you need to confront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away.\n\n\"In the end we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch. The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the players looking distraught.\n\n\"They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying. Every other team was celebrating with their fans at that and we were on our knees.\n\n\"So I had to correct how they were viewing things.

We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before.\n\n\"We've got to use this opportunity to change history as a motivation and that's how the players see it.

In the last eight, the Three Lions shrugged off some of the stinging criticism with a penalty shoot-out win over Switzerland and Southgate thinks his team are 'freer' now.\n\n\"One of our strengths over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition,\" said Southgate. \"But I think at the beginning of the tournament, expectation weighed quite heavily and of course, the external noise was louder than it has ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place.

He said: \"We need another step from what we showed in the last game, it's a step up in quality of opponents and we are ready for that.\"\n\nLike England, the Netherlands have enjoyed a benign route to the last four, defeating Romania 3-0 and Turkey 2-1 in the knockout stages. The Dutch believe they can pull off a win and will be backed by an estimated 75,000 fans in Dortmund, many of whom will be without a ticket for the match.\n\nHowever, the team had to change plans at the last minute when their Deutsche Bahn service to Dortmund was cancelled.

The debate continues.\n\nSend your views on this subject and more to theeditor@football365.com\n\nGareth Southgate is basically Sean Dyche\n\nIt's mad how opinions swing so wildly. Southgate goes from the worst manager in the tournament to the best.\n\nTo me, and I may be wrong - but it's how I've felt all tournament, we are winning despite Southgate and not because of him. It is entirely possible for him to make a couple of good substitutions and get the win, and still be mediocre overall.\n\nHe's obviously a \"good\" manager though (for England). You don't get to finals in major competitions by being bad. I just don't think he's exceptional or elite, and I can't see that scoring last-minute winners or equalisers is the best way to go about winning games. Why not make those changes earlier and try and try too see the game out comfortably? I thought the same about Koeman though to be honest, if he thought that bringing on 2 attackers was the best way to score in the last 2 minutes, why not try that 10 / 15 mins earlier?\n\nAs for the penalty. Here's my take for what it's worth. It all depends on whether you believe the defender was trying to challenge Kane, or if he was trying to block the shot. If it's a challenge on Kane, it's a high foot with studs up and no contact with the ball. Therefore a penalty. If he's trying to block the ball and Kane kicks his boot, it's not a penalty.\n\nIt's very hard to call to be honest, especially looking at slow motion and still images on a VAR screen. My personal take is that VAR should never have been involved. It was a difficult call and the ref made the decision on the pitch. Not obviously wrong therefore shouldn't have been a penalty. If the ref had given it then it should have been a penalty.\n\nOn the final. I think that on balance of play over the tournament it would be a shame for Spain not to win it. However as an Everton fan I know how it's possible to play utter shite for 4/5 games in a row, then play an absolute blinder when it counts (you lost the league at Goodison Park).\n\nSouthgate actually reminds me a lot of Dyche, and I can't help but think, this is exactly how Dyche would play if he had an abundance of amazing attackers at his disposal. He would not have a clue about how to get the best out of them, so he'd focus on being disciplined and defensive and hope that they produced some magic at the top.\n\nIf we do end up winning the tournament (which I don't expect) I just hope we win it convincingly and un-controversially. Wouldn't it be great to just go and smash them 4-0 or something.\n\nJames EFC\n\nMORE EURO 2024 ENGLAND COVERAGE ON F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 16 Conclusions on England 2-1 Netherlands: Watkins, subs, Mainoo, Southgate, *that* penalty and more\n\n\ud83d\udc49 'Arise Sir Gareth of Southgate' as England fans respond to epic victory\n\n\ud83d\udc49 England player ratings v Netherlands: Watkins a national hero as Foden, Mainoo shine\n\nSliding doors time for Southgate\n\nIt seems to me we are approaching a hugely significant sliding doors moment. For Gareth Southgate, this England football team (and some of these players in particular) and the nation as a whole.\n\nWhilst there must be some element of pressure relieved on Gareth Southgate after last night's result and performance - the final is massive. That's because the game on Sunday will fully determine his lasting legacy.\n\nIf England win, it'll be statues, a knighthood, the keys to number 10, 10 million in bitcoin and probably a handful of firstborns in tribute from the endearing public, some of which will have to eat humble pie and accept that when you look at it objectively, he will have to go down as the most successful England manager of all time.\n\nA man who has critically altered the state of games en route to the final through balanced, careful and thoughtful substitutions.\n\nA man who, whilst may not have given us a dominating tournament win instead littered the route to success with game-changing moments that will live on in the memory as we tell our kids about Bellingham's overhead, Watkins' injury time stunner, of Kyle Walker completing more than 45% of his passes. He will live and die as a hero of our nation and be fondly remembered forevermore, even by his detractors who might disagree with his approach, but cannot object to his results.\n\nIf we lose, then Southgate's lasting legacy will be (deservedly/undeservedly so depending on the strength of your opinion) one of failure, of a 'nearly man', of a manager who despite being presented with the tools and the opportunities to get us over the line after almost 60 years, just couldn't do it. Too pragmatic, too safe, too risk averse. Poor decision making, passive, overly loyal, putting square pegs in round holes. Whilst it won't be like 1996 again, there will certainly be an overbearing feeling of 'what if' from himself and the nation.\n\nYes, the final is massive for a Spain side looking to recapture their place at the summit for over a decade. But for England, and Southgate in particular - Sunday is his opportunity to ascend to Godhood.\n\nEngland beat the Netherlands on possession, shots, shots on target, xG and of course goals in a major semi final. They also, dare I say it, looked actually pretty good (a press, and a left back, thank the Lord).\n\nYes there was a soft penalty, but also woodwork hit and a clearance off the line. Yes this wasn't a vintage Dutch side but it's nonsensical to say VVD, Gakpo and co aren't a big team. So England have not lost to the first big team they played.\n\nEngland are likely not as good as Spain but the joy of knockout football is that anything can happen as a one-off, especially if you're good at penalties, and England now look like they won't be embarrassed at the very least.\n\nWhatever happens on Sunday, I'm very pleased for Gareth to get another tournament landmark. The last few years have been enormously better than the wasted decade of McLaren, Capello and Hodgson. England are regularly relevant in the business end of tournaments for the first time... ever?\n\nWhile it's only one match I think this semi was a big deal for Gareth's place in the England manager rankings. Without a big performance and normal time win against a big team this would have felt like a frustrating and cagey tournament with more luck than anything else, and a big drop off from 2021-22. But the performance was finally there in the notionally toughest game, and the key subs to bring on Watkins and Palmer paid off.\n\nShould the performances in the earlier rounds be better? Absolutely, but it's the results that matter. Can another manager come in and do better? Maybe, but think Potter or McKenna, not Pep - the pool of top flight managers who'd consider England and aren't in demand at CL-chasing clubs is pretty thin.\n\nGareth, you're the one for me.\n\nRoger (coming home?), Newcastle in London\n\nMORE EURO 2024 ENGLAND COVERAGE ON F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 16 Conclusions on England 2-1 Netherlands: Watkins, subs, Mainoo, Southgate, *that* penalty and more\n\n\ud83d\udc49 'Arise Sir Gareth of Southgate' as England fans respond to epic victory\n\n\ud83d\udc49 England player ratings v Netherlands: Watkins a national hero as Foden, Mainoo shine\n\n...From Ed Acteson yesterday... 'So I'm sorry John, Southgate's record isn't enough for me to want him to stay on, or to stop me having an opinion if I think we've played badly, and if that makes me a 'miserable shite', a 'dumb keyboard pundit' or 'in denial of my own empire guilt' in your eyes then so be it.'\n\nI wonder if this miserable shite is celebrating today? Johnny Nic has a gloriously over the top way of supporting Southgate, I'm not sure if he got the exact reason correct, but its plausible and there is something really strange about why Southgate gets so little credit.\n\nSouthgate pulled off a f**king master class yesterday. The fact that Palmer and Watkins have the belief to come on and pull that crazy out of the hat is down to a man instilling that belief and freedom in them. The English players have forever been terrified of failure, Southgate is piece by piece building their belief back up and all we do is knock him for it.\n\nAlso people should watch the Stefan De Vrij interview from NOS (Dutch TV). It's cringingly awful, with a couple of interesting points.\n\n- . De Vrij couldn't remember Watkins' name he just calls him 'the striker'. The Dutch team themselves, didn't have a clue that Watkins existed. They know is name now.\n\n- The interviewer asks De Vrij a series of awful questions - How did hescore? Has your world just collapsed? Yes. Well has it really? Do you yourself? Have you just let a unique chance go? As De Vrijsteadily gets more pissed off and depressed.\n\nIan, LFC, Belgium\n\nMore on that England penalty\n\nI disagree with your conclusion on the penalty, although I agree that it shouldn't be a penalty. Kane got his shot away, so it didn't prevent a goal scoring opportunity in the box.\n\nAs many people have commented, it would have been a free kick and a card outside the box, so I think the appropriate punishment should be a straight red red card for dangerous foul play, and no penalty.\n\nI've seen too many incidents from defenders and goalkeepers, where they clattered into a forward in a dangerous manner after the shot has been taken, and received no punishment. Dumfries foot was high with studs out and nowhere near the ball. If he was trying to kick it his foot should have been coming up from the ground and he would have hit Kane with the top of his boot. Painful but not dangerous.\n\nThat's my ha'penny worth anyway.\n\nWatkins goal superb by the the way. Mainoo involved in that too. He's potentially the best England player I have seen.\n\nCharles (Maybe Southgate is a genius after all)\n\n...In response to Dave, Dumfries. When almost all the English pundits agree that it wasn't a penalty then you can be damn sure it never should have been given.\n\nBut I will use your logic there to see what you think of the ref not giving any penalties to the Netherlands? You said \"There is nowhere else outside of the Dutch box that anyone debates that as foul at a minimum\". Well then, where were the 3 penalties for the fouls at the 3 corner kicks that the Dutch got???\n\nI'm not saying it is only the English players that do this, nor am I saying its only at corner, but using corners from last nights match as an example to disprove your argument - there were a grand total of 3 corners last night, all to the Dutch. Each and every corner had players pulled and dragged. Declan Rice was the most obvious culprit. All 3 times he was holding/dragging a Dutch player with both hands. Yet no penalties were given. Guaranteed if that happened around the centre circle, frees and yellow cards are given. \"There is nowhere else outside of the English box that anyone debates that Declan Rice fouls at a minimum.\"\n\nJohnnybruff\n\nThanks for Mainoo, Man Utd\n\nI cannot begin to tell you how impressed I was (and have been since his 1st game) with Kobbie Mainoo\n\nWhat a player that young man is.\n\nHe was utterly brilliant during that first half and while quieter in the second was still making tackles on the edge of his box and playing forward passes into the other box\n\nThankyou to Eric Ten Hag and Man Utd for letting the lad play (due to injuries and sort of by accidental default) but I don't care.\n\nHe is just wonderful to watch (obviously gutted he plays for you lot but credit where it due)\n\nHe's been my player of the tournament for us at least. Without him NONE of this happens imo!\n\nStill got all the flags up for a few more days (she hasn't divorced me yet),\n\nAl - LFC and England (The Pen was clearly reverse Koeman Karma for '93 - I take it we have stopped moaning about dodgy refs and match fixing)\n\nMEDIAWATCH: England 'work experience kid' Kobbie Mainoo is no Lewis Cook, mind...\n\nBye bye Badwolf\n\n\"Who needs changes when it's all going so well? Obviously.\" So says Bad Wolf, less a mailbox contributor and more a sentient collection of generic football opinions (\"Spurs have no bottle/Arsenal only want to walk it into the net\" etc).\n\nIf England win can we get a mailbox break from them and their ilk? If England lose can we get a mailbox break from them and their ilk? I love reading reactive opinions, we're not experts here, but this team is hard to dislike, the manager and his team obviously know what they're doing, and I say this as an Irishman for f**k sake.\n\nBazzzzz (looking forward to the British media asking Gareth why they only beat Spain 1-0 on Sunday night)", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News

A chance to get to a first final not held in England - first time England will have ever done that.\n\n\"We're trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated, but the players have responded brilliantly and resilience has been built.\"\n\nThat strength was needed during the early stages of the tournament in Germany, where frustrated England fans greeted the end of the group draws against Denmark and Slovenia with boos.\n\nSome beer cups were even aimed Southgate's way after the latter stalemate in Cologne, where he warned the \"unusual environment\" around them was making life harder for the players.\n\nHigh-profile criticism from former internationals like Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer added to the background noise, which all combined to have a negative impact on the team.\n\n\"One of the strengths of us over the last seven, eight years has been less fear, less inhibition.\n\n\"But I think at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed quite heavily and of course the external noise was louder than it's ever been.\n\n\"I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and, in the end, what was impressive was that the players ground it out, they ground results out and found ways to win.\n\n\"I felt that shifted once we got into the knockout stage and definitely in the quarter-final. I thought we saw a better version of us with the ball, freer.\n\n\"I'm not sure any of the messaging changed, but I just felt the group changed.\"\n\n\"We haven't had that for a few years. Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well.\n\n\"But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset.\n\n\"I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into the game tomorrow.\"\n\nSouthgate says his squad now want to \"use the opportunity to change history as a motivation\" after overcoming a sense of fear.\n\n\"It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away.\n\n\"In the end we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch. The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the players looking distraught. They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying.\n\n\"Every other team was celebrating with their fans at that and we were on our knees, so I had to correct how they were viewing things.\n\n\"But of course that feeling was being reinforced so vocally and actively outside and I think they were picking up on that too much.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Img38561350.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

However, a section of fans enjoyed themselves, cheering the German cop. The Southgate lookalike enjoyed the attention of the fans as he was trying his best to keep them in line before the semi-final.

Southgate, a skilled defender in his prime, climbed the ladder at Crystal Palace before penning his first professional contract with the club in 1988.\n\nHe spent seven fruitful years in south London before moving to Aston Villa in 1995, where he made an impressive 191 appearances over six years. His playing career concluded at Middlesbrough, joining the North East side in 2001 and adding another 160 matches to his tally before retiring in 2006.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2004, Southgate also earned 57 caps for England - invaluable experience for understanding the pressures of international football when he assumed managerial duties for the senior men's team in 2016. Here, The Mirror provides a comprehensive guide to everything football enthusiasts need to know about Southgate; including his net worth, salary, achievements and future prospects.\n\nHas Gareth Southgate been successful with England?\n\nDespite not securing a major trophy for his country in either a player or managerial capacity, the 53-year-old has seen more success in the latter role than many of his predecessors. He's currently England's longest-serving manager since Bobby Robson and is arguably second only to Sir Alf Ramsey - the genius behind England's 1966 World Cup victory - in terms of all-time success.\n\nWhile his best World Cup performance was reaching the semi-finals with Croatia in 2018, Southgate has led England to two consecutive European Championship finals - coming painfully close to winning the 2020 tournament, only to be heartbreakingly defeated on penalties by Italy. The Euro 2024 final against Spain on Sunday could be Southgate's last chance at glory with the nation, arguably the most significant challenge of his career so far.\n\nHow much does Gareth Southgate earn?\n\nSouthgate's current contract - which was renewed in 2021 to run until the end of the current European Championships - reportedly pays him just over \u00a35million per year, equivalent to around \u00a3100,000 per week. Only Fabio Capello sits higher in the reported England boss earnings throughout history, pulling in a staggering \u00a36million per year during his tenure, while Sven Goran-Eriksson earned approximately \u00a34.5million annually.\n\nWhat is Gareth Southgate's net worth?\n\nThe net worth of Gareth Southgate, the England manager, varies according to different sources. However, data from 2020 estimated his wealth at about \u00a39m, accumulated from both his playing and managing careers.\n\nWhat's on the horizon for Gareth Southgate?\n\nSpeculation mounts that failure to clinch victory this Sunday could spell the end of Southgate's tenure as England manager. Prior to the tournament, he declined an extension on his contract, which ends in December. This decision reportedly came out of concern that contract negotiations might distract from team focus.\n\nIn a recent interview with German newspaper Bild, Southgate confessed: \"If we don't win, I probably won't be here anymore. Then it might be the last chance. I think about half of the national coaches leave after a tournament that's the nature of international football. I've been here for almost eight years now and we've come close.\"\n\nHe also voiced concerns about maintaining credibility, saying: \"So, I know that you can't keep standing in front of the public and saying 'please do a little more' because at some point people will lose faith in your message. If we want to be a big team and I want to be a top coach, then you have to deliver in the big moments.\"\n\nWhile Southgate's name emerged as a possible candidate for the Manchester United job, Erik ten Hag recently laid rest to those rumours by confirming he'll remain at Old Trafford for another season. Yet despite the uncertainty hanging over Southgate's future should he exit the England post, he has expressed readiness for whatever comes next.\n\nIn a candid Sky Sports interview last December, he reflected: \"I was 35 years old when I managed in the Premier League and we finished 12th and 13th. I knew nothing like what I know now. There isn't a job in world football that would intimidate or daunt you, having lived this one.\"\n\nWho's next in line for the England hot seat?\n\nSpeculation is rife about who will take over the reins of the England squad once Gareth Southgate steps down. Graham Potter, the ex-Chelsea and Brighton gaffer, is currently tipped as the favourite to lead the national team, especially since he's free after his stint in west London ended on a sour note.\n\nBut let's not count out other contenders with impressive credentials Eddie Howe, Pep Guardiola, and Mauricio Pochettino have all been mentioned as potential candidates to steer the Three Lions towards future glory, each boasting remarkable achievements in English top-tier football.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Reaching the final could rekindle a love affair with the team's supporters.\n\nA coach once idolized by his team's fans -- and with the most consistently successful record of any England manager -- had been the target of a volley of plastic cups from disgruntled fans at one game, and criticism from British TV commentators over his cautious approach.\n\nWednesday's 2-1 win over the Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semifinals might change all that.

Both were crucial goals that kept England's hopes alive.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Southgate's most notable experiment in Germany was one that backfired, deploying right back Trent Alexander-Arnold as a central midfielder in the opening 1-0 win over Serbia and 1-1 draw with Denmark.\n\nEngland faces Spain in Sunday's final, one game away from what would be its first men's trophy since winning the 1966 World Cup on home soil.\n\n\"The only reason I took the job was to try and bring success to England as a nation and try and improve English football.

England are in the Euro 2024 final. Ollie Watkins' last minute winner meant they beat the Netherlands 2-1 in Dortmund, and will now face Spain in Berlin on Sunday. Nevertheless, despite England making it to back-to-back European Championship finals, manager Gareth Southgate still doesn't seem to get adequate praise for taking them there. 'They've had an easy route' some people claim. 'With those players they should be winning the tournament easily' say others. But in reality every game at a major tournament is difficult and having great players is no pre-requisite to winning major international trophies - just look at England's last 'golden generation'.\n\nTournament football has never been easy, and England making it to another final should be immensely celebrated. Before they made it to the final of Euro 2020 three years ago, England hadn't been to a major final in 55 years. Since Southgate has been manager, England have become big game players at these tournaments. And the 53 year old possesses a mightily good record at major tournaments - in fact when it comes to points per game (ppg), the very best. He's now completely level with Sir Alf Ramsey, who won the World Cup with England in 1966, with exactly the same average ppg record at major tournaments, but Southgate has managed more games.\n\nAs you can see above, Southgate trumps all England managers records when it comes to results at major tournaments. You have to go back to Ramsey who last managed the Three Lions in 1974 to find a boss who can match his record of 2.08ppg. If England beat Spain in the final on Thursday, Southgate would actually become the outright number one, moving to 2.12ppg. Yet the England boss is still constantly vilified and often ridiculed by the media and supporters alike. It was only two weeks ago England fans were chucking cups of beer at him. There is a perception, that with England's embarrassment of riches when it comes to attacking talent, Southgate should let the shackles off and play more attacking football, but is that really how you win major tournaments?\n\nPortugal won Euro 2016, and only won one game in 90 minutes (a 2-0 win against Wales in the semi-final). They made it through the group with three draws and just three points. It's not even like Southgate even has a bad record when it comes to his England side scoring goals at major tournaments. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, the Three Lions scored nine goals in the group, including a 6-1 win over Iran, and then beat Senegal 3-0 in the round of 16 - only both of the finalists in Argentina and France scored more that tournament. Also, quite incredibly, no England manage in history has led the nation in more games at major tournaments than Southgate now has with 25 matches in charge. That's already ten more than the next manager on that list in Sir Bobby Robson. He will hit 26 on Sunday in what could be his last ever game in charge.\n\nDuring the four tournaments he has managed in, England have scored 43 goals in 25 games, averaging at 1.72 goals per game - not a bad record at major tournaments. Some of the criticism is of course worthy. Most people would agree that Southgate is not an elite tactician in the bracket of Pep Guardiola, Mikel Arteta and perhaps even Germany's Julian Nagelsmann. His in game management has sometimes been questionable, but nobody could argue with his substitutes against the Netherlands, as Cole Palmer and Watkins combined to send the Three Lions to Berlin. He has truly united the group and made players want to play for England again, and a record of a semi-final, losing a final on penalties, a quarter-final where you crash out to the holders, and now another final is a superb record.\n\nOf course, the counter to that would be England have generational talent, but that's not a pre-requisite to international success. The Three Lions infamous 'golden generation' that boasted the likes of Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, David Beckham and Wayne Rooney never even made it past a quarter-final. Many international sides oozing with world class talent have faillen short at major international tournaments, and striking the balance between attacking football and being a tight ship defensively is usually key to success. As the Euros has progressed this summer, many of the questions around Southgate's capability of being a successful England manager have be answered. Before Southgate there was 0 European Championship finals in 60 years. With him there will now be two in just three years.

On Wednesday night in Dortmund he made one that may reverberate through the country's football history.\n\nSouthgate's journey as England manager can be encapsulated by these two moments, the first when he failed to substitute Harry Kane and the second when he did.\n\nThere was a period during the semi-final when all I could think about was the 2021 final against Italy. That night at Wembley, one of the reasons England lost was because Southgate had to replace Kane with a striker with more pace and energy - what the modern coaches like to call a \"finisher\".\n\nMany people analysed the Italy game and argued the defeat was because of negativity. It wasn't. England's strategy was fine, but the personnel could not execute it because Kane was unable to expose Italy on the counterattack.\n\nThe echoes against the Dutch were eerie heading towards the climax. Before Ollie Watkins' winner, the match was almost a mirror image.\n\nOn both occasions, England made the better start.\n\nOn both occasions, the opposition manager was forced to rip up plan A and make a tactical change.\n\nOn both occasions, the opposition's changes were effective and it looked like Southgate was failing to react to the challenge of his coaching rival.\n\nThen we saw the difference between the Southgate of 2021 and the Southgate of 2024.\n\nWatkins' introduction won England the match. Kane would not have been able to score such a winning goal, as Watkins was occupying that space on the shoulder of the last defender and using his pace to stretch the Dutch defence. Kane was playing much deeper.\n\nNobody can say Southgate lacks courage now.\n\nThere will be plenty applying retrospective wisdom and saying it was obvious he should have taken Kane off. When you are the England manager facing the prospect of extra-time, it is not such a straightforward decision.\n\nYou have to think long and hard before subbing the England captain, the nation's record goalscorer, and a player who usually only needs one chance to change the game.\n\nSubbing Kane was necessary but it was also brave.\n\nWe all know Southgate is a coach who likes to let the game ride before acting. There are times when it seems like he is leaving it too late. He is justified in asking the critics to put emotion to one side and check out the results. When late goals become a habit after changes in personnel, the accusations of luck lose their credibility.\n\nEngland proved to be superior to Holland on the pitch and in the dug-out. The biggest compliment to the players and coaching staff was the haste with which Ronald Koeman had to make his alterations both to tactics and personnel.\n\nSouthgate deserves credit for that as one of the architects of England's rethink of our football over three decades. Although there has been some reminiscing about the win over Holland in Euro '96, that was not typical of the national team during that era.\n\nRewind to the darker times and the momentum of the semi-final would have been reversed. The Dutch had the players with the technique, coached to retain possession, while the England players were encouraged to nullify superior teams.\n\nThe evolution of our academy system began the change in perceptions of English football, and Southgate championed that when managing at a younger level. Whatever the outcome had been in Germany, the fruits of those labours were visible.\n\nNow the view of England's performances across the tournament will be reconsidered. There is merit to the argument that our players are better suited to facing sides who want to \"have a go\" rather than sit back and invite pressure.\n\nFor all the criticisms of early games - a lot of it fair - no side has hurt England defensively. Holland did not have the quality to do so, England never pinned back to resist prolonged periods of pressure.\n\nOf course, that might change on Sunday when England face their biggest test, against Spain. There will be a school of thought that superior opponents will expose flaws that were identified in earlier games. On the evidence of the semi-final, we should not be so sure.\n\nThere are two Englands in this Euros. There is the team that struggles against low block defences and the one which thrives when given the time and space to express itself.\n\nSpain will not be defending. That makes for an exciting prospect because the likes of Phil Foden are getting better with every match.\n\nWhat is particularly reassuring is that this England team has demonstrated the winning mentality necessary to go all the way.\n\nThere was an air of triumphalism across the nation after the penalty shoot-out win over Switzerland. That will be amplified now England are in the final.\n\nFor the players and manager, it will not be enough. In Spain, they are facing an opponent who cares only about taking the trophy home. They will take no consolation from losing a final. Over the past 23 years, Spanish sides have played 22 major finals against teams outside of Spain. They have won every one. Second is not an option.\n\nNow the same applies to England. They have timed their form to perfection. Now they can go and win it and Southgate assumes plenty of the credit.\n\nEvery manager can make a mistake. What is essential is they do not make the same one twice. Southgate has learnt his lessons and England may reap the reward of a major tournament win.\n\nOliver Brown\n\nOn evidence of this England performance, football might just be coming home Read more", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_carragher@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Carragher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Under-17_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Under-17 Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2024/07/10/TELEMMGLPICT000385141312_17206502515760_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjYhR_zPGtOXeDioyLaEvFTHZHYWBFzixpTGl2MoejA0.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

But Southgate says that returned with ex-players' criticism and being seen as pre-tournament favourites. However, Southgate believes his squad have grown into the challenge.\n\nEngland's slow start has not set the pulses racing but after a last-gasp comeback against Slovakia and then penalty shootout heroics against Switzerland, the confidence is growing. Three Lions boss Southgate said: \"Ours is a sport where you sometimes play as well as the opponent allows you and we know we didn't start the tournament well.\n\n\"For me, that's been a fascinating experience to see the team have been fearful in the opening part of it. Almost concerned about what could go wrong. We haven't had that for a few years.\n\n\"Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well. But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset. We saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into the Holland game.\n\n\"We definitely spoke about it. When you can sense that feeling you need to confront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away. In the end we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch.\n\n\"The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the players looking distraught. They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying. Every other team was celebrating with their fans at that and we were on our knees.\n\n\"So I had to correct how they were viewing things. But that feeling was being reinforced so vocally and actively outside and they were picking up on that too much.\n\n\"A lot of the work has to be done in meetings. We've had some tough says in camp, and you want the players to be enjoying the last couple of days, but balancing that with keeping the focus.\n\n\"You know the games are such high profile and such a big opportunity. You don't need to push too much, too early. We've tried to find that balance, but its definitely helpful that we've been through this a few times now.\"\n\nSouthgate is the first England manager to lead the team into three semi-finals of a major tournament. But that only serves to raise expectation levels. But it has clearly wound up Southgate to see other nations celebrate winning their groups or knock-out games while England fans threw beer at the manager when they topped theirs.\n\nThey have come so close under Southgate but ultimately his reign will be judged on the next five days and the end of this Euros. But Southgate warned it will not be easy against another European super power, although he stressed that England are now catching up Holland in football terms.\n\nSouthgate added: \"I've got huge admiration for the Netherlands as a country, fairly small population but their football culture for decades has been phenomenally good. They've been to other semi-finals and latter stages of tournaments as well.\n\n\"Our semi-final tally looks a bit healthy now, a bit more like what we'd hope an England history would look like. But there are a lot of nations who have won the European Championship and we haven't. And we want to try and correct that and redress that balance.\n\n\"There's no question we're further on in our development as a team. But it is another moment in time. You have to deliver in these moments with all the circumstances both teams will have.\n\n\"But definitely coming into this now with more big match experience behind so many of the squad is something we're very happy about.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

I mean, they press very, very well, so we're going to have to be exceptional with the ball, and we're going to have to be exceptional without it.\n\n\"But it's a final, you expect it to be that way. They've been the best team. We're starting to show a better version of ourselves.\n\n\"The extra day is a concern. You know, in the last few tournaments that's been a problem for finalists, so we've got to do the very best we can to recover the players as well as we can.\n\n\"But we're not going to be on the training ground. That's simple. We'll be walking through things or delivering things in meetings, which was the same for this game.\n\n\"But we're in there and with what we've shown to this point we have as good a chance as they do.\"\n\nSpain are the bookmakers' favourites to triumph in Berlin, where Southgate will attempt to mastermind England men's first continental crown having fallen agonisingly short in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nEngland's squad has a new look to it nowadays but the core from the Italy defeat remains, with Southgate utilising that experience as the group quickly refocuses on Spain.\n\nHe said: \"When I took this job I'd had three years as a Premier League manager. I've now had 100 internationals, some of the biggest games in world football. You learn all the time from that.\n\n\"We're more calm going into the knockout games because the first time we did it in Russia (at the 2018 World Cup) we hadn't won a knockout game for 10 years.\n\n\"We hadn't been through the experience - quarter-finals, semi-finals, you know, we've managed a lot of those games now, so you're definitely much better prepared because every experience you go through you learn from.\n\n\"You're improving all the time, your knowledge, your understanding, so I would say if you're a coach and you're not doing that there'd be a problem, really.\n\n\"But the last final was the first final, first European Championship final, I'd ever managed, so if I didn't get everything right apologies for that but we'll try and do better this week.\"\n\nEngland returned to their Blankenhain base after Wednesday's Dortmund triumph to rest, recover and refocus on their toughest test yet.

After the dismal draw with Slovenia in the group stages in Cologne, Southgate has turned his team's fortunes around and is now on the brink of redemption. Southgate's selections have raised many eyebrows, but he has ensured that England is just one game away from ending the \"years of hurt\" for the men's team, stretching back to the 1966 World Cup win under Sir Alf Ramsey.\n\nGareth Southgate's decisions have come under scrutiny: both the ones he made and the ones he didn't. Eyebrows were raised when he substituted captain Harry Kane and Phil Foden, who have been the prime forces of England's side in the tournament.\n\nHowever, the supersubs of Ollie Watkins and Cole Palmer, with the clock ticking toward 90 minutes, justified his substitutions. He had the option of Ivan Toney for Kane's replacement, but he picked Watkins, who proved to be a masterstroke, helping England reach their consecutive Euro final and their first-ever final on foreign soil.\n\nEngland's best football display silenced the vast Oranje fans who had rebuilt the part of Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion known as \"The Yellow Wall\".\n\nSouthgate faced the heat from the fans and pundits for his over-cautious approach in the major tournaments, but he silenced his critics after the Three Lions booked their berth in the Euro 2024 final after beating the Netherlands 2-1. Gareth Southgate for the first time showed his emotions on the pitch for the first time on the field.\n\nAfter the win, Gareth Southgate said, \"If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were. We are kindred spirits in many ways, but of course, I'm the one who has to pick a team. So to give them a night like tonight, it's very special.\" The story from him being pelted with beer cups to him getting applauded defines it all.\n\nIn the post-match conference, Gareth Southgate expressed his emotions, stating, \"We all want to be loved, right? When you're doing something for your country, and you're a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back and when all you read is criticism, it's hard. So to be able to celebrate the second final is very, very special.\"\n\nIf England manages to beat the unbeaten Spain in the final, then this will be England's first major title in 58 years. This will also prove Southgate's naysayers wrong and make him an idol in English football history.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fiza_narwal@news9live.com", "name": "Fiza Narwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alf Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cologne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gareth-Southgate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

A fearless Spain await on Sunday, an opponent that would love nothing more than two banks of four to pick apart with their dashing wingers. The torpor of the group stage is mercifully behind is. Southgate finally arrived at a system that gets the best of his talented group, none more so than Phil Foden, who for the first time in the tournament looked like Phil Foden.\n\nPerhaps Southgate used as energy the heavy criticism that fell upon England's remote enclave in Blankenhain. Castle walls that have held for 900 years were powerless to keep out the censure and opprobrium of fans and media, who did not like what they were seeing. When Gary Lineker hits the fan, you know you are in trouble.\n\nHowever, the leap was made from back-four to back-three. The template is set. Spain, powered by twin turbos left and right, Nico Williams Jr and the remarkable Lamine Yamal, for two days yet still only 16, fancy themselves to beat anybody. But England, having found the keys to adventure, have their weapons too.\n\nGetting to this point triggered a vehement philosophical debate around an England team led by a coach anchored to a pragmatic world view. Despite his understandable unease at criticism that became personal, Southgate has his defenders. They point to his record in major tournaments; nine wins in the knockout stages of major tournaments to date, three more than all the managers combined between 1968 and 2016 when he took over.\n\nThe final in Berlin is England's first on foreign soil. This is clearly worthy of praise, yet, should England fail on Sunday, Southgate will have left England where he found them, with only one major trophy in the cabinet. If, as the argument goes, it's all about winning, then, however harsh it sounds and however good it felt on Wednesday, it amounts to nil money in the bank.\n\nThe opening half an hour against Serbia and the Dutch display apart, Southgate has presided over an awful tournament. This followed a period of uninspiring displays this year in which they lost to Brazil and Iceland and drew against Belgium, all at home. The sense that opportunity was draining away felt entirely valid. The frustration of watching arguably England's most talented group since 1966 trapped in and endless loop of sideways and backwards movement, was too much for right-thinking folk to bear. Even Lineker reached for the s**t bomb.\n\nSouthgate's greatest achievement had been to make England fun again for the players and the fans. The sense of optimism was spawned by the march to the semi-finals in Russia six years ago, followed by the narrow defeat on penalties at the last Euros final, and latterly the quarter-final defeat to France at the World Cup in Qatar, which was arguably Southgate's highwater mark since England were arguably the better team in a thrilling contest.\n\nBut all that momentum seemed to have been lost in Germany, where Southgate was slow to accept there was any kind of problem. He steadfastly stuck to his players and formations when it was clear change was required. \"Your best players are your best players,\" was his mantra. Yes, but they were nowhere near playing at their best.\n\nSouthgate retreated behind a siege mentality. He spoke of the disturbing and disruptive \"noise\" about the camp, and saw the problem not as one of his making, but the inability of observers to see what he could see. This is inevitable when the rhythm and mood of an enclosed environment is designed to keep prying eyes from looking in. Yet he could not ignore the denunciation of former players and pundits, who filled the ether with their condemnations.\n\nSouthgate claimed his phone was off for the duration. Clearly the message got through and with it the truth, finally accepted by him, that performances were not good enough and something had to change. The fear is that, given his innate conservativism, Southgate reverts to caution in the face of the Spanish threat.\n\nYes Spain are good, not least because they believe themselves to be so. There is no inhibition in the group. No self-doubt. The formation is set around a central axis of Rodri, Fabian Ruiz and Dani Olmo, supported by the flying wingers outside. France, led a by a coach in Didier Deschamps who is even more cautious than Southgate, sought to contain and hit on the counter.\n\nFrance scored first then sat back, which invited the inevitable response. Spain were rampant for an hour, but they themselves slowed in the second half when France took the brakes off. That final 20 minutes points the way for England. Spain did not look so peachy with Bradley Barcola running at them.\n\nFor Barcola read Cole Palmer. England have the tools to take down any team, including Spain, but they can't do that by being passive. They have to go at Spain like they did the Netherlands, who could not live with them in the opening 45 minutes, with Foden and Kobbie Mainoo controlling the match.\n\nPalmer proved the key to victory with his incisive pass to Ollie Watkins. The goal came in the nick of time. Both Palmer and Watkins should have been on earlier. They might need to be on Sunday. For Southgate, history beckons. And who knows, perhaps an audience with the King.

I mean, they press very, very well, so we're going to have to be exceptional with the ball, and we're going to have to be exceptional without it.\n\n\"But it's a final, you expect it to be that way. They've been the best team. We're starting to show a better version of ourselves.\n\n\"But we're not going to be on the training ground. That's simple. We'll be walking through things or delivering things in meetings, which was the same for this game.\n\n\"But we're in there and with what we've shown to this point we have as good a chance as they do.\"\n\nSpain are the bookmakers' favourites to triumph in Berlin, where Southgate will attempt to mastermind England men's first continental crown having fallen agonisingly short in the Euro 2020 final.\n\n\"The lads are singing in the dressing room, but they're straight in the ice,\" he said with a laugh after the Signal Iduna Park semi-final.\n\n\"There won't be any wild parties. We've had a couple of those already, so we pick our moments for those.\n\n\"But in terms of the experience, of course every game you manage, every tournament you manage, you learn so much.\n\n\"We're more calm going into the knockout games because the first time we did it in Russia (at the 2018 World Cup) we hadn't won a knockout game for 10 years.\n\n\"We hadn't been through the experience - quarter-finals, semi-finals, you know, we've managed a lot of those games now, so you're definitely much better prepared because every experience you go through you learn from.\n\n\"You're improving all the time, your knowledge, your understanding, so I would say if you're a coach and you're not doing that there'd be a problem, really.\n\nEngland returned to their Blankenhain base after Wednesday's Dortmund triumph to rest, recover and refocus on their toughest test yet.\n\nSouthgate said Harry Kane \"took quite a big knock when he won the penalty\" he converted shortly after Xavi Simons slammed the Dutch ahead, but played on until Watkins replaced him in the 81st minute.\n\nThe England manager also said full-back Kieran Trippier \"had a little bit of a problem\", leading them to expedite the decision to bring on Luke Shaw at half-time.\n\n\"We're still deciding how long he could play for, but we felt to be able to bring him into the game and finish with that balance was better than to start it and then have to take him off.\n\n\"We'll have to see how our Tripps is but, I mean, he's been an absolute soldier for us.\n\n\"To fill in the way he has and produce the level of performance on the wrong side of the pitch with the injuries he came into the tournament with as well has been absolutely phenomenal.\"", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news",

I felt that shifted once we got into the knockout stage.\"\n\nHe said the players overcame difficulty and showed resilience, with a response he called brilliant, with a desire to make history by winning their first European Championship.\n\n\"You're now into that moment in the tournament where it's what's possible, what's achievable rather than what might go wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"So this is now the chance to make history which we've enjoyed doing.\"", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--4Z6tAn-k--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-07-09t190744z_1_lynxmpek680sr_rtroptp_3_soccer-euro-nld-eng-preview.jpg?itok=ezisgV1N", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

After being dominated in a first half that ended tied at 1-1, Dutch boss Ronald Koeman changed his approach at half-time, sending on Wout Weghorst, closing up the spaces Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden and Kobbie Mainoo had been exploiting and asked a different question of England and Southgate.\n\nFor a while, it flummoxed them. England had nine shots in Wednesday's 2-1 win but none between the 41st minute and 87th. Southgate waited a long time before making his move.\n\nMemories of Croatia in 2018, France in 2022 and even the previous Euros final in between -- which England lost on penalties -- began to resurface as Southgate seemed unable to reverse the momentum ebbing away from his side.\n\nThe conversations he has on the touchline with trusted assistant Steve Holland can seem interminable. There is no doubt other managers are more proactive, instinctive even.\n\nBut having been largely forced into bringing on Luke Shaw at half-time as Kieran Trippier suffered a groin problem that makes him a doubt for Sunday's final, Southgate's double change with 10 minutes to go was, eventually, bold.\n\nHarry Kane is England's all-time leading goal scorer and captain, but despite scoring the first-half penalty that cancelled out Xavi Simons' sublime opener, he was flatfooted, tired and far too easy to mark. Southgate suggested afterward that the Denzel Dumfries challenge on Kane, which led to his penalty, had left a mark on the forward.\n\nFoden was also caught in the wider malaise but had been so dangerous in the first half, having a shot cleared off the line before hitting the post from long range. Taking them both off for Ollie Watkins and Cole Palmer was not an easy call given their reputations and standings, but it was the right one.\n\nPalmer fired over in the 88th minute but then played a clever pass through for Watkins, who turned Stefan de Vrij and fired a stunning shot across Dutch goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen and just inside his right-hand post. Cue pandemonium.\n\nSomewhere in the maelstrom, Southgate reacted by introducing Conor Gallagher and Ezri Konsa to see out stoppage-time and spark more jubilant scenes at full-time. After allowing the players to take centre stage in front of the euphoric England supporters, Southgate took a moment to celebrate passionately in front of them.\n\nThis is a tournament campaign that has been blighted by fitness issues from the outset and heavy criticism from supporters throughout. Now, beer was being thrown in the air, not at Southgate.\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right? When you are doing something for your country and you are a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back and all you read is criticism, it is hard,\" Southgate said after the match. \"To be able to celebrate a second final is very, very special. Especially the fans that travel.\n\n\"Our travelling support is amazing, the money they spend, the commitment to do that, to be able to give them a night like this -- and we have given them a few over the last six years from Russia onwards -- it means a lot. If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were.\n\n\"We're kindred spirits in many ways. Of course, I'm the one that has to pick a team. To be able to give them a night like tonight is very, very special.\"\n\nEngland's opening 45 minutes was the best football they have produced all tournament. Admittedly, the bar for that was pretty low after a series of underwhelming displays, but there was an energy and dynamism about them after Simons' superb seventh-minute strike put the Netherlands in front.\n\nKane's equaliser came from a penalty that could only really have been awarded in the VAR era, but England were good value for it until the Netherlands shut the game down, making this a similar watch to England's stifled displays against Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia and Switzerland in particular.\n\n\"They were a three-box-three in the second half so we weren't able to be quite as incisive in the second half but we kept the ball really well and made them run,\" Southgate said. \"Maybe in the end, that's the bit that's fatigued them and has been critical in the goal that we scored. There was a lot going on in the game. In the end, it is the players who make the decisions on the pitch, and they did it brilliantly.\"\n\nOf course, the cycle will only truly be broken if England can go all the way and win their first major men's honour since 1966. This is not a vintage Netherlands side and England have, once again, benefitted from a kinder half of the draw. Final opponents Spain look in the sort of form to give England by some distance their toughest match this summer.\n\nSouthgate was asked about the prospect of beating Spain. \"We'll have to get the ball off them first,\" began his reply.\n\nBut having scrambled for answers all tournament -- changing Declan Rice's midfield partner three times, switching systems from a back four to a three-man defence -- Southgate came up with the game-changing moment when it really mattered.\n\nIt may be a one-off. Criticisms of him will remain, despite a tournament record that now reads: semifinal, final, quarterfinal, final. But England are now in a position where Southgate only needs to be right one more time to achieve immortality.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors":

On Wednesday night in Dortmund he made one that may reverberate through the country's football history.\n\nSouthgate's journey as England manager can be encapsulated by these two moments, the first when he failed to substitute Harry Kane and the second when he did.\n\nThere was a period during the semi-final when all I could think about was the 2021 final against Italy. That night at Wembley, one of the reasons England lost was because Southgate had to replace Kane with a striker with more pace and energy - what the modern coaches like to call a \"finisher\".\n\nMany people analysed the Italy game and argued the defeat was because of negativity. It wasn't. England's strategy was fine, but the personnel could not execute it because Kane was unable to expose Italy on the counterattack.\n\nThe echoes against the Dutch were eerie heading towards the climax. Before Ollie Watkins' winner, the match was almost a mirror image.\n\nOn both occasions, England made the better start.\n\nOn both occasions, the opposition manager was forced to rip up plan A and make a tactical change.\n\nOn both occasions, the opposition's changes were effective and it looked like Southgate was failing to react to the challenge of his coaching rival.\n\nThen we saw the difference between the Southgate of 2021 and the Southgate of 2024.\n\nWatkins' introduction won England the match. Kane would not have been able to score such a winning goal, as Watkins was occupying that space on the shoulder of the last defender and using his pace to stretch the Dutch defence. Kane was playing much deeper.\n\nNobody can say Southgate lacks courage now.\n\nThere will be plenty applying retrospective wisdom and saying it was obvious he should have taken Kane off. When you are the England manager facing the prospect of extra-time, it is not such a straightforward decision.\n\nYou have to think long and hard before subbing the England captain, the nation's record goalscorer, and a player who usually only needs one chance to change the game.\n\nSubbing Kane was necessary but it was also brave.\n\nWe all know Southgate is a coach who likes to let the game ride before acting. There are times when it seems like he is leaving it too late. He is justified in asking the critics to put emotion to one side and check out the results. When late goals become a habit after changes in personnel, the accusations of luck lose their credibility.\n\nEngland proved to be superior to Holland on the pitch and in the dug-out. The biggest compliment to the players and coaching staff was the haste with which Ronald Koeman had to make his alterations both to tactics and personnel.\n\nSouthgate deserves credit for that as one of the architects of England's rethink of our football over three decades. Although there has been some reminiscing about the win over Holland in Euro '96, that was not typical of the national team during that era.\n\nRewind to the darker times and the momentum of the semi-final would have been reversed. The Dutch had the players with the technique, coached to retain possession, while the England players were encouraged to nullify superior teams.\n\nThe evolution of our academy system began the change in perceptions of English football, and Southgate championed that when managing at a younger level. Whatever the outcome had been in Germany, the fruits of those labours were visible.\n\nNow the view of England's performances across the tournament will be reconsidered. There is merit to the argument that our players are better suited to facing sides who want to \"have a go\" rather than sit back and invite pressure.\n\nFor all the criticisms of early games - a lot of it fair - no side has hurt England defensively. Holland did not have the quality to do so, England never pinned back to resist prolonged periods of pressure.\n\nOf course, that might change on Sunday when England face their biggest test, against Spain. There will be a school of thought that superior opponents will expose flaws that were identified in earlier games. On the evidence of the semi-final, we should not be so sure.\n\nThere are two Englands in this Euros. There is the team that struggles against low block defences and the one which thrives when given the time and space to express itself.\n\nSpain will not be defending. That makes for an exciting prospect because the likes of Phil Foden are getting better with every match.\n\nWhat is particularly reassuring is that this England team has demonstrated the winning mentality necessary to go all the way.\n\nThere was an air of triumphalism across the nation after the penalty shoot-out win over Switzerland. That will be amplified now England are in the final.\n\nFor the players and manager, it will not be enough. In Spain, they are facing an opponent who cares only about taking the trophy home. They will take no consolation from losing a final. Over the past 23 years, Spanish sides have played 22 major finals against teams outside of Spain. They have won every one. Second is not an option.\n\nNow the same applies to England. They have timed their form to perfection. Now they can go and win it and Southgate assumes plenty of the credit.\n\nEvery manager can make a mistake. What is essential is they do not make the same one twice. Southgate has learnt his lessons and England may reap the reward of a major tournament win.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Youth and High School", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FBgzLpZn9UytsebJAUprcA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDk-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_telegraph_624/285b2e5a4723a309f1fddeb32b3ff63a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

How England's most polarising manager changed a generation", "body": "Whether you love or hate him, there's no denying the job Gareth Southgate's done in helping lift England out of a dark period.\n\nSouthgate took over as England manager in November 2016 after a successful spell as interim manager following Sam Allardyce's inevitable departure. When the 45-year-old Southgate took the job, England had just been embarrassingly bundled out of Euro 2016 by Iceland.\n\nIf we were to go further back, England had only reached two semi-finals and zero finals in 17 major competitions from 1966-2016. The Three Lions had not experienced good times on the international stage since the heroics of Sir Alf Ramsey, who led the team to their sole big trophy - the 1966 World Cup win.\n\nFor such a proud footballing nation, this was not good enough.\n\nIt's safe to say no one would have expected Southgate, of all people, to lead England back to success on the world stage. Since Southgate's managerial debut against Malta in November 2016, the former Aston Villa and Middlesbrough defender has managed a century of games for England, only behind Ramsey (113) and Walter Winterbottom (139).\n\nHe also boasts the second-highest win percentage of English managers who have managed over 50 games (60%) behind Ramsey, who sits above all with 61.1%. Southgate reached the Euro final in 2020 for the second time in the country's history and will remarkably do so again in 2024. This type of success is not and has not been normal for England, and the new generation of fans should realise that.\n\nSo why is it that Southgate gets so much stick despite arguably being England's greatest-ever manager?\n\nIf you were to illustrate Southgate's tenure as England manager, a perfect example would be England's Euro 2024 run. England's road to the final has visibly been a struggle at times, and no real momentum has been acquired. Despite this, Southgate's team somehow finds themselves among the last two at Euro 2024.\n\nNothing is ever perfect in this world, but something had to change for England to achieve real success. The most apparent difference under Southgate was the newfound emphasis on results over viewability, leading to decreased enjoyment of English games. Labelled 'boring,' 'safe,' and 'flawed,' Southgate's managerial style has always been a topic of heavy controversy, even more so than his results on the pitch.\n\nSouthgate may be overly conservative or pragmatic but has backed it up with promising results. Yes, his greatest strengths are also his greatest flaws, costing England two chances at major silverware. The what-ifs will always remain. Who knows what could have been if the English manager had been more proactive and decisive in important games such as the Euro 2020 final and the 2018 World Cup semi-final.\n\nHowever, it is not certain that England would have even gotten that far without Southgate's influence. Southgate has positively impacted the team, turning an English team of individuals into a collective, something many past managers could not do. Southgate's tenure was the first time in a long time that an England team looked so well-bonded and positive. Before the semi-final win against the Netherlands, Luke Shaw praised Southgate for taking England 'to the next level.' Man management is also a vital asset in a manager's arsenal, and it was missing for England many years before Southgate's arrival.\n\nSouthgate's time will inevitably be up soon if he does not achieve silverware, but genuine English fans will acknowledge the body of work he has done for the nation. Despite some disappointing results, what Southgate has achieved in the bigger picture should be appreciated. Southgate's teams have exceeded expectations, while superior squads have faltered in the past.\n\nPrevious English sides had better personnel and played better football, but they didn't have anywhere near the level of success Southgate's sides have had. Take the 2002 World Cup, for example. Headlined by names such as Gerrard, Beckham, and Ferdinand, this England generation had arguably the greatest English players of all time but never managed to reach a semi-final stage.\n\nSuccess was never achieved due to a lack of team chemistry and little tactical organisation. England's golden generation of the early 2000s arguably performed better than the highly touted Brazilians in the 2002 World Cup quarter-final. However, the records don't lie. England never had the foundations of a proper national team to see out those games.\n\nMaybe it was because Southgate was part of the squad in 2002 that he is who he is today. The manager's ideology projects solidity over the inconsistent, expansive approach of old. As a result, the unbalanced and non-cohesive nature that defined past sides went down the drain. Southgate's teams are tenacious and organised by design, but most importantly, they have shown a strong togetherness that surpasses all past English sides.\n\nBarring the penalty shootout loss to Italy in 2020, England has won three out of four shootouts in major competitions since Southgate took over. Their penalty record is not purely down to luck; Southgate has instilled confidence and resilience in this new crop of English talents. Also, since Southgate has been in charge, England has won eight knockout matches, five of which were in the European championships. When England needed a guiding hand beyond tactics, Southgate was there.\n\nDespite the various opinions, one thing is for sure. The whole of England will have Southgate's back in Berlin against Spain. It was not easy or good to watch for England in Euro 2024 at times, but like magic, they're in another European final. How Southgate does it should not work, but it does. If you were a scriptwriter, your senses would tingle at this matchup.\n\nIs this the fairytale farewell for England's most ever polarising manager? As the last six years have proven, anything is possible.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "minh_tran@theroar.com.au", "name": "Minh

Suddenly England are synonymous with dramatic comebacks, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, riding their luck, riding waves, winning penalty shootouts, reaching semi-finals, reaching finals.\n\nEngland, whose only major trophy came when they won the World Cup on home soil in 1966, had never previously reached a European Championship final. Southgate -- the much-maligned, much-derided Southgate -- has led them to two in succession. This one, against Spain in Berlin on Sunday, will be their first major final beyond England's shores.\n\nThey fell just short against Italy three years ago, beaten on penalties at Wembley, and on Sunday they will face the outstanding team of Euro 2024. But after a night like this, with a dramatic victory secured by substitute Watkins with 89 minutes and 59 seconds showing on the stadium clock in Dortmund, England's players might feel as if destiny is on their side.\n\nOr, as a Chinese journalist phrased it in a question to Southgate during his post-match news conference, \"Why do miracles always happen with this team? Why do subs always become supersubs?\"\n\nWhat a change in narrative, not just from England's inglorious pre-Southgate history but from that grim 0-0 draw with Slovenia in Cologne a fortnight ago when the manager went to applaud the fans and was shocked to be greeted with jeers and a hail of plastic cups.\n\nThey flirted with disaster against Slovakia, 1-0 down deep into stoppage time until Jude Bellingham's spectacular equaliser. They were unconvincing against Switzerland but prevailed in a penalty shootout, another mental block that has been overcome under Southgate's management.\n\nThey fell behind again just seven minutes into Wednesday's semi-final against the Netherlands and seemed to have run out of ideas and energy in the second half. But again they dug deep and again Southgate came up trumps with his substitutions, this time by sending on Watkins in place of a flagging Harry Kane.\n\nIt takes courage to take off your captain and all-time leading goalscorer when you need a goal. It is something Portugal coach Roberto Martinez was notably unwilling to do with a 39-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, as if imagining it would be iconoclastic to do so, but Southgate has been bold and decisive, replacing Kane in all three of England's matches in the knockout stages in the belief the captain's race was run and it was time for fresh legs.\n\nIt takes a lack of ego from the player, too, and a commitment to the greater good. Kane was the first off the bench and down the touchline to leap on Watkins at the final whistle. That illustrated the collective spirit that Southgate has always described as this team's greatest strength. Likewise the celebrations between Pickford and his understudy Aaron Ramsdale and the delight on the face of players like Trent Alexander-Arnold, who would be forgiven for feeling glum at having to watch so much of the tournament from the bench.\n\nEngland never used to be this kind of international team. In the past, there was the occasional World Cup or European Championship where things would appear to come together for a week or two before the inevitable penalty shootout defeat, but there was never a consistency of performance -- or even a consistency of outlook -- from one tournament to the next. Under Southgate, they have reached a World Cup semi-final, then a European Championship final, then a World Cup quarter-final and now another European Championship final.\n\n\"We've had some incredible nights over the last seven or eight years,\" Southgate said afterwards. \"We're giving our supporters some of the best nights they've had in 50 years. The reason I took this job was to try to bring success to England. To be able to take England to a first final overseas, I'm immensely proud of that.\"\n\nHe looked more than just proud. He looked overcome with joy, grateful to feel the love from players and supporters alike, in stark contrast to the scenes in Cologne. \"We all want to be loved, right?\" he said. \"When you're doing something for your country and you're a proud Englishman and you don't feel that back, and all you read is criticism, it's hard. So to be able to give them nights like this... .\"\n\nWhatever happens in Berlin, if this is to be Southgate's final week in the job, he will leave behind a highly-impressive body of work, even taking into account the usual caveats about the standard of opposition faced along the way. That England landed on the gentler side of the draw in Germany, as they did at the 2018 World Cup, is beyond doubt. But winning your group, avoiding the kind of mishaps and missteps taken by England teams in the past and by France and Italy at Euro 2024, will often give you that possibility.\n\nA final against Spain sounds like a far more serious test than England have faced so far -- and they came perilously close to flunking some of those previous examinations. But a semi-final against the Netherlands represented a step up in quality and intensity. They fell behind to a spectacular early goal from Xavi Simons, but what followed, even before Kane equalised by converting a contentiously-awarded penalty, was their best spell of football of the tournament so far.\n\nThat is not a high bar by any means, but how refreshing it was to see 19-year-old Kobbie Mainoo setting the rhythm, 21-year-old Jude Bellingham driving forward and 22-year-old Bukayo Saka and 24-year-old Phil Foden flitting between the Dutch defensive lines, running at and tormenting their opponents. In different ways, the first-half performances of Mainoo and Foden were truly captivating.\n\nFoden came close three times before the interval: first seeing a shot stopped on the line by Denzel Dumfries after a mesmerising dribble through a crowded penalty area, then grazing the outside of the post with a characteristic swerving shot from 25 yards, then testing Bart Verbruggen with a similar effort. That Bruce Springsteen-inspired \"Phil Foden's on fire\" chant? For the first time at the tournament, it was true.\n\nBut the spark went out. England's second-half performance was unrecognisable from what had gone before. Southgate spoke about the tactical challenges his opposite number Ronald Koeman had set him and his team. He called it a \"very complicated game\", one in which England had nearly 60 per cent of the possession but looked susceptible to the counter-attack as the second half went on.\n\nAs against Switzerland, their attacking threat seemed to evaporate after half-time. A better team -- and Spain are a better team than England have faced so far -- would have made them pay. But with Stones, Kyle Walker, Marc Guehi and Declan Rice digging deep and typifying the \"resilience and character\" Southgate spoke about, they held on.\n\nAgain the substitutions proved pivotal. Cole Palmer has made an impact from the bench every time he has come on. Watkins had only been summoned once before last night, in the closing stages of the 1-1 draw with Denmark, but Southgate was right to think this particular game called for the Aston Villa forward's speed and incisive runs.\n\nWatkins felt it too, telling Palmer at half-time they were going to combine for the game's winning goal. They did -- and how, Palmer playing a ball behind the Dutch defence and Watkins turning sharply before crashing a low shot inside Verbruggen's far post. Like a last-gasp winner from another Aston Villa player, David Platt, against Belgium at the 1990 World Cup, it will go down as one of the most memorable, most dramatic England goals.\n\nWatkins said afterwards he was \"lost for words\". But he articulated it well, the sense of incredulity at what he had just done. \"Whenever you score, emotions come through your body,\" he said. \"But this was just a different feeling. I felt like I was in slow motion when I was running over to the boys. I didn't want to come off the pitch at the end. I just wanted to soak it all in.\"\n\nSo did England's supporters, who stayed behind long after the final whistle, singing, \"Don't take me home, please don't take me home\". Home isn't calling yet -- or if it is, there might have to be some amendments to flights, awkward calls to home and work and perhaps to the bank to extend an overdraft. Berlin is calling and there are more trains to be booked, more accommodation to be found, more tickets to be bought, more gallons of beer to be drunk and more memories to be made.\n\nThat will be how the Southgate years are remembered. The years of hubris, fecklessness and abject underachievement on the international stage have given way to an era of humility, focus, quiet consistency and loud, frenzied celebrations. Their performances in Germany have been far from consistent, but at all except the bleakest moments -- and yes, 1-0 down to Slovakia in stoppage time was pretty bleak -- there has been a sense, watching them, that if their collective spirit does not quite save the day, a moment of individual brilliance might.\n\nFor many years, that sense of hope was absent with England. Southgate and this generation of players have changed the record. The challenge now is to win on Sunday and change the national team's history by landing that first trophy since 1966.\n\nCan they beat Spain? \"We'll have to get the ball off them first,\" Southgate said with a smile. And unlike two weeks ago, everyone laughed along. It had been that kind of night, after which anything seems possible for England. They will need to improve, but we keep saying that and they keep getting through. It's all very un-English, really, isn't it?", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_kay@nytimes.com", "name": "Oliver Kay",

Subjected to both literal and metaphorical storms, his strategic genius has brought England to the precipice of a victory that could redefine his tenure and the team's legacy.\n\nDuring a tension-filled semi-final against the Netherlands, Southgate's tactical decisions were under the microscope. With England's hopes hanging in the balance, the removal of Harry Kane and Phil Foden -- decisions that could have sparked outrage -- proved astute. Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins brought on as substitutes, collaborated in the dying minutes of the game to deliver a blow that sent England soaring into the finals against Spain. Watkins' goal, a sleek turn and shot past the Dutch goalkeeper, erupted into celebrations, marking a moment of perfect synergy between manager and squad.\n\nThe match unfolded under ominous skies in Dortmund, an apt metaphor for the pressure that had been mounting on Southgate. The Dutch team, known for their resilience, found themselves outmanoeuvred by a resolute England side that displayed their finest football when it mattered the most.\n\nThis journey to the final is a stark contrast to the earlier stages of the tournament, where Southgate faced severe criticism. From the disappointing draw with Slovenia to confronting disgruntled fans, Southgate's path has been anything but smooth. However, his ability to withstand criticism and adhere to his tactical philosophy has brought England to the brink of their first major international trophy since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nIn the tempest of the semi-final, Southgate's choices, particularly in the latter stages of the game, showcased his growth and resilience as a manager. The victory was not just a testament to strategic acumen but also to emotional grit.\n\nAs England gears up for the final in Berlin, there is a palpable shift in the psychological landscape of the team. The players, once burdened by the weight of historical failures, now enter the final with a blend of confidence and cautious optimism. Southgate, too, appears transformed. The criticisms that once seemed to mark his managerial approach have given way to a more relaxed, confident demeanour.\n\nThis transformation is crucial as England prepares to face Spain, a team known for their tactical finesse and historical dominance in European football. The final represents more than just a game; it is a battle for legacy, for vindication, and for ending the decades of near-misses and heartaches.\n\nAs the final approaches, the narrative around Southgate has shifted. No longer just a manager striving to win over his critics, he stands as the architect of England's resurgence on the international stage. His leadership has seen England through a World Cup semi-final in 2018, a Euro 2020 final, and now, another shot at glory in Euro 2024.\n\nThe question remains: can Southgate conclude this saga with the triumph England has craved since 1966? The final against Spain is not just a test of tactical skill but of historical resolve. As Southgate and his team prepare, they do so knowing that victory would not only scratch a 58-year itch but also cement their place in the annals of football history.\n\nIn conclusion, Gareth Southgate's journey with England at Euro 2024 is one of dramatic highs and challenging lows. From battling criticism to making bold tactical decisions that have led to stunning victories, Southgate's tenure is a narrative of redemption and resilience. As England stands on the brink of a historic victory, the final against Spain looms not just as a match but as a moment of destiny. Southgate's legacy, intertwined with England's fortunes, is ready for its most defining chapter.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VQOr.a5eOYuQXaWz9ZPldQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/epl_index_articles_253/9e2ddef734c9120defe8f090ce47408c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The Three Lions won one and drew two group-stage matches before narrowly beating Slovakia and edging past Switzerland on penalties in the knock-out stages.\n\n\"We couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place,\" Southgate said. \"One of our strengths over the years has been having less fear, and showing less inhibition. But at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed heavily and the noise from outside had never been louder.\"\n\nEngland captain Harry Kane emphasised the importance of past experiences in approaching tough games like Wednesday's semi-final. \"During the game, you lean on experience, the leaders who have been there and done that,\" Kane said.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's about going out there and taking the opportunity with both hands. Reaching back-to-back European Championship finals would be an amasing achievement and we have the opportunity to\n\ndo that.\"\n\nThe winners of Wednesday's semi-final will play Spain on Sunday after their 2-1 win over France on Tuesday.\n\nReflecting on previous tournaments, England were beaten by Italy on penalties in the Euro 2020 final, reached the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, and were knocked out by France in the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup.\n\nWhile Kane acknowledged that \"as we've been getting better the expectation gets higher,\" he said the added pressure can sometimes boost players.\n\n\"Some will use it in different ways, some will use it as motivation, some will just block it out and focus on what they need to do. Everyone's different. From a team point of view, we know what we need to achieve. We have a game; a really tough game and we need to be ready for it. We've prepared for that.\"\n\nSouthgate, known for making late substitutions, said changes are \"not pre-conditioned\" and depend on the game. \"You are always looking at the freshness of the team and the balance of the team and whether changes are going to make an improvement to the team or not,\" he said. \"The game will take us in a certain direction that will make that decision for us.\"\n\nDefender Luke Shaw, who made his first appearance from the bench in the win against Switzerland after returning from injury, remains uncertain about the starting lineup.

The Danes, meanwhile, were jubilant with their point and celebrated wildly with their supporters.\n\nAfter reaching the final of the last Euros and getting to a World Cup semi-final, the expectations have risen. But the by-product has been the pressure on England to win - and win well. Southgate's decision was to hit the reset button with a team meeting before their final Group C game.\n\n\"For me that's been a fascinating experience to see the team have been fearful in the opening part of it, almost concerned about what could go wrong. We haven't had that for a few years,\" said Southgate, whose team can make history by defeating Holland in Dortmund and reach England's first major final on foreign soil.\n\n\"Maybe that was (because of) expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well. But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset. I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into this game.\"\n\nSouthgate has seen a different England since the group stages were wrapped up. They were saved by Jude Bellingham against Slovakia in the last-16 but were creating more chances. They were better again when they faced Switzerland in the quarter-finals.\n\nDeclan Rice spoke about the \"reset\" meeting that has been a turning point in the finals. Southgate admitted at the time there were \"honest\" conversations to get back on track.\n\n\"We definitely spoke about it. When you can sense that feeling you need to confront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"In the end we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch. The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the players looking distraught. They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying.\n\n\"Every other team was celebrating with their fans at that and we were on our knees. So I had to correct how they were viewing things. But of course that feeling was being reinforced so vocally and actively outside and I think they were picking up on that too much.\"\n\nSouthgate's attempt to change the mindset of the squad has been a constant operation, reinforcing his messages during the long days at England's basecamp at their Spa & GolfResort Weimarer Land hotel. It means the final team-talk at Westfalenstadion before facing the Dutch may not be a Churchillian speech to send his players out to make history.\n\n\"I haven't decided yet,\" said Southgate. \"For me the messages are constant. We meet with the players all the time. We've had a tactical meeting in the morning before the game. The tone of everything you deliver, the messages behind everything you deliver, the way we talk to them individually on the training pitch, it's constant.\n\n\"I know everybody would love to think there's one speech just before a game that is the bit that makes the difference -- because in the films it is -- but when you're psychologically trying to condition a team it's a 24/7 process and your conscious of getting that tone and those messages right all the time so that actually the last bit should matter less.\n\n\"I still think it's an important moment to get right, but your hitting the players with that all the time and I think it's something we've always thought a lot about as a coaching team.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2024/07/09/TELEMMGLPICT000382619368_17205584595500_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhygnGeH7rGSts5KI6RABzikXEc6hf6Xk60Kfhoz-0Zw.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

We've given our supporters some of the best nights in the last 50 years. I'm hugely proud of that.\n\n\"I'm delighted if everyone at home is feeling the way we are and the way those in the stadium were. But we're not finished.\n\n\"We've got the greatest possible test to prepare for. We came here to try to win the tournament and that's still our aim.\"\n\nIt has not been a smooth ride for England, who are the first side in Euros history to reach the final despite trailing in both their quarter-final and semi-final games.\n\nJude Bellingham's bicycle kick in the 95th minute saw them edge past Slovakia in the last 16, and they needed a penalty shootout to beat Switzerland.\n\nCriticism has come their way with fans displaying their frustration, throwing plastic cups aimed at Southgate after their 0-0 draw with Slovenia in the group stages.\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right? When you're doing something for your country, you're a proud Englishman - you don't feel that back and all you read is criticism, it's hard,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"To be able to celebrate a second final is very special. If I had not been on the grass, I would have been watching and celebrating like [the fans] were.\n\n\"I'm the one that has to pick a team so to be able to give them a night like tonight was very special.\n\n\"We have come here to win and play the team who have been the best in the tournament [in the final]. But we're still here and fighting.\"\n\nHaving suffered defeat against Italy at Wembley three years ago, England are determined not to come away empty handed this time.\n\nReal Madrid midfielder Bellingham told BBC Radio 5 Live that the team have \"lived to fight another day\" as they attempt to become the first English men's side since 1966 to win a major trophy.\n\n\"I am really proud of the boys. The reaction, attitude and mentality... Quality is one thing, but those characteristics you cannot learn in training - you get it from experience and each other,\" he added.\n\n\"Now it is one more game. We are tired, it has been a long season, but is one last push for our country and for history.\"\n\nManchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, 19, has impressed in the knockout stages and became England's youngest player to appear in the semi-finals of a major tournament.\n\n\"It is an indescribable feeling, we are all buzzing! It has been such a journey and we have built on old performances,\" Mainoo told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nEngland responded when Harry Kane put away a contentious penalty and they dominated large periods before Watkins provided the winning moment late on.\n\n\"I feel drained and like I have been out there myself. It is a great night,\" former England striker Alan Shearer said.\n\n\"At times you have to suffer in international football. When it got tough, they had to come up with different answers and they had to find a way again.\n\n\"This team has done that without playing spectacular football in four or five of the games. Now they have an incredible chance of winning it.\"\n\nFormer England defender Gary Neville said this squad does \"whatever it takes\" to win games and are improving standards.\n\nSo is there a feeling that England could upset tournament favourites Spain in the final?\n\n\"It feels like it is going to be the time. At every moment they have been doubted and it is a great story up until this point, why shouldn't it go on?\" said former England defender Matthew Upson.\n\n\"One of the big things about this group is that they have a bit of cockiness and arrogance about them - but in a good way.\n\n\"We have players exceeding huge levels of performances in top teams across the world. We are confident and it shows with the penalties and in moments like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Upson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Upson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/4c1a8f1cfefa6d94c8361217b6a2cac1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

I mean, they press very, very well, so we're going to have to be exceptional with the ball, and we're going to have to be exceptional without it.\n\n\"But it's a final, you expect it to be that way. They've been the best team. We're starting to show a better version of ourselves.\n\n\"The extra day is a concern. You know, in the last few tournaments that's been a problem for finalists, so we've got to do the very best we can to recover the players as well as we can.\n\n\"But we're not going to be on the training ground. That's simple. We'll be walking through things or delivering things in meetings, which was the same for this game.\n\n\"But we're in there and with what we've shown to this point we have as good a chance as they do.\"\n\nSpain are the bookmakers' favourites to triumph in Berlin, where Southgate will attempt to mastermind England men's first continental crown having fallen agonisingly short in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nEngland's squad has a new look to it nowadays but the core from the Italy defeat remains, with Southgate utilising that experience as the group quickly refocuses on Spain.\n\n\"The lads are singing in the dressing room, but they're straight in the ice,\" he said with a laugh after the Signal Iduna Park semi-final.\n\n\"There won't be any wild parties. We've had a couple of those already, so we pick our moments for those.\n\n\"But in terms of the experience, of course every game you manage, every tournament you manage, you learn so much.\n\n\"When I took this job I'd had three years as a Premier League manager. I've now had 100 internationals, some of the biggest games in world football. You learn all the time from that.\n\n\"We're more calm going into the knockout games because the first time we did it in Russia (at the 2018 World Cup) we hadn't won a knockout game for 10 years.\n\n\"We hadn't been through the experience - quarter-finals, semi-finals, you know, we've managed a lot of those games now, so you're definitely much better prepared because every experience you go through you learn from.\n\n\"You're improving all the time, your knowledge, your understanding, so I would say if you're a coach and you're not doing that there'd be a problem, really.\n\n\"But the last final was the first final, first European Championship final, I'd ever managed, so if I didn't get everything right apologies for that but we'll try and do better this week.\"\n\nEngland returned to their Blankenhain base after Wednesday's Dortmund triumph to rest, recover and refocus on their toughest test yet.\n\nSouthgate said Harry Kane \"took quite a big knock when he won the penalty\" he converted shortly after Xavi Simons slammed the Dutch ahead, but played on until Watkins replaced him in the 81st minute.\n\nThe England manager also said full-back Kieran Trippier \"had a little bit of a problem\", leading them to expedite the decision to bring on Luke Shaw at half-time.\n\nSouthgate hopes Trippier \"could be OK\" for Sunday, adding: \"We didn't want to take any chances and we had it in our minds that bringing Luke into the game with that balance at some point.\n\n\"We're still deciding how long he could play for, but we felt to be able to bring him into the game and finish with that balance was better than to start it and then have to take him off.\n\n\"We'll have to see how our Tripps is but, I mean, he's been an absolute soldier for us.\n\n\"To fill in the way he has and produce the level of performance on the wrong side of the pitch with the injuries he came into the tournament with as well has been absolutely phenomenal.\"", "source": {"uri":

Reaching the final could rekindle a love affair with the team's supporters.\n\nA coach once idolized by his team's fans -- and with the most consistently successful record of any England manager -- had been the target of a volley of plastic cups from disgruntled fans at one game, and criticism from British TV commentators over his cautious approach.\n\nAlso Read | UEFA Euro 2024: Ollie Watkins' Late Goal Put England Into Final After Beating Netherlands 2-1.\n\nWednesday's 2-1 win over the Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semifinals might change all that. Southgate's team played a more open, attacking style for much of the game, and his decision to take off captain Harry Kane paid dividends when substitute Ollie Watkins scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner.\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right? When you're doing something for your country and you're a proud Englishman, when you don't feel that back and when all you read is criticism, it's hard. So to be able to celebrate the second final (after Euro 2020) is very, very special,\" Southgate said, paying tribute to England's traveling fans.\n\nAlso Read | President Droupadi Murmu Plays Badminton with Former Olympic Medallist Saina Nehwal Ahead of Ace-Shuttler's Her Story - My Story' Lecture (Watch Video).\n\n\"If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were. We are kindred spirits in many ways but of course I'm the one who has to pick a team. So to be able to give them a night like tonight, it's very special.\"\n\nSouthgate was once seen as someone who reconnected England with its fan base, making them fall back in love with the team.\n\nSupporters sang of Southgate being \"the one\" and the vest - or waistcoat -- he wore at the 2018 World Cup became one of the iconic symbols of his first major tournament in charge.\n\nBut a loss on penalties to Italy at home in the Euro 2020 final seemed for some to show the limits of his cautious tactics as England tried and failed to defend an early 1-0 lead.\n\nAt Euro 2024, England's path to its semifinal game against the Netherlands featured some games that were hard to watch -- England didn't have a shot on goal until deep into added time against Slovakia in the round of 16, and the 80th minute against Switzerland in the quarterfinals. Both were crucial goals that kept England's hopes alive.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Southgate's most notable experiment in Germany was one that backfired, deploying right back Trent Alexander-Arnold as a central midfielder in the opening 1-0 win over Serbia and 1-1 draw with Denmark.\n\nEngland faces Spain in Sunday's final, one game away from what would be its first men's trophy since winning the 1966 World Cup on home soil.\n\n\"The only reason I took the job was to try and bring success to England as a nation and try and improve English football. To be able to take the team to its first final overseas, I'm immensely proud of that,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"We play the team who have been the best team in the tournament and we have a day less to prepare so it's a huge task.

Also leading the country to a World Cup semi-final and quarter-final, the Boro legend is the first manager of the men's national team to lead the country to two major international tournament finals.\n\nThe stage is set for Southgate and co to make history on Sunday evening as they play Spain in Berlin, though their route to the final has been far from easy. Not at their best for much of the tournament, Southgate has come under much scrutiny as various decisions and performances overall have led to vocal critics.\n\nREAD MORE: Four England stars all make the same point about ex-Middlesbrough star Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink\n\nBut having played under Southgate after emerging from the Boro academy during his time in charge at the Riverside, Josh Walker knows better than most how the Three Lions boss is, and believes he deserves far more credit than he's currently getting.\n\n\"Let's be honest, he's done fantastic to get England where they are,\" Walker told Sky News. \"When he first took over, we were in a real bad situation. He's come in and delivered a semi-final, a quarter final and a final and now another final. For a team that hasn't performed great, if we're being really honest, I think it's a really good sign.\n\n\"We haven't really been lucky over the years and this year has probably been our worst performance in terms of games, but we're in a final again. A lot of credit has to go to Gareth. We're all England managers when we're sat on the sofa watching and we're thinking 'why's he not coming on?', 'why's he still on?' etc. But his decisions are working.\"\n\nAs Walker alludes to, Southgate's selection choices and in-game changes have come under particular scrutiny during the tournament in Germany this summer. But it was substitute Ollie Watkins who fired England into the final on Wednesday evening, while Ivan Toney was credited his vital contribution from the bench in the round-of-16 against Slovakia.\n\nKeeping every player happy when so desperate to play games can't be easy, but the England players not starting games are coming off the bench and making positive contributions. Walker, who had his own frustrations with game-time during his time working under Southgate, believes the England boss is a huge factor behind that.\n\n\"He was very calm and very assured with everything he did,\" Walker said. \"I've been in the changing room when he has lost it at times, so he's definitely got that side to him where he can switch. But I think an environment like that, you just want to try and make it fun. He's obviously building an environment there where the players feel comfortable and enjoy going away and that's down to Gareth and his staff.\n\n\"As players, when you work under managers you don't always agree with every decision he will make. I know there will be players in that squad who will be unhappy they haven't played as many minutes as they would have liked. But based on my experiences with Gareth, he was very honest with you.\n\n\"Whether you agreed with the decision or not, he was always honest with you, and I'm sure he is that way with the England lads. Whatever you think of him as a manager, as a person he's a really good guy. He always has the time to speak to everyone. Whether you're the cleaner or the chairman, he would speak to everyone in the exact same way. He would listen to you and take time to have an honest chat with you. I think that, when you work with top players, that will benefit him massively.\n\n\"I wasn't the most patient of players, which probably didn't benefit me. Of course there will be lads in the squad doing the same kind of thing because all footballers want to play. I was the same - I wanted to play and felt I deserved to play. But now we're in the final, I'm sure every single player will be supporting whichever lads are on the pitch, whether they're getting on or not. He has and he's done a great job.\"\n\nEngland are likely to be the underdogs on Sunday evening against Spain, who are widely regarded as the best-performing team of the tournament and deserving finalists. But England have managed to continue finding ways to win even when not at their best and Walker is backing them to go all the way this time.\n\nHe concluded: \"It was brilliant. The way it finished was unbelievable and the first-half performance was probably the best we've had in the tournament. I really do think we can go and win.\n\n\"Let's be honest, in terms of overall performances, we've been poor. The criticism and scrutiny when you're England manager is on you all the time. But now we're in the final, performance doesn't matter. We can play poor and go and win it, we'll all be happy. I'm going to say 1-0 England.\"", "source": {"uri": "gazettelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gazette live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "craig_johns@gazettelive.co.uk", "name": "Craig Johns", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Walker_(footballer,_born_1989)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Walker (footballer, born 1989)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riverside Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Floyd_Hasselbaink", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29522008.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Netherlands-v-England-Semi-Final-UEFA-EURO-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

So to be able to celebrate the second final (after Euro 2020) is very, very special,\" Southgate said, paying tribute to England's traveling fans.\n\n\"If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were. We are kindred spirits in many ways but of course I'm the one who has to pick a team. So to be able to give them a night like tonight, it's very special.\"\n\nSouthgate was once seen as someone who reconnected England with its fan base, making them fall back in love with the team.\n\nSupporters sang of Southgate being \"the one\" and the vest - or waistcoat -- he wore at the 2018 World Cup became one of the iconic symbols of his first major tournament in charge.\n\nBut a loss on penalties to Italy at home in the Euro 2020 final seemed for some to show the limits of his cautious tactics as England tried and failed to defend an early 1-0 lead.\n\nAt Euro 2024, England's path to its semifinal game against the Netherlands featured some games that were hard to watch -- England didn't have a shot on goal until deep into added time against Slovakia in the round of 16, and the 80th minute against Switzerland in the quarterfinals. Both were crucial goals that kept England's hopes alive.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Southgate's most notable experiment in Germany was one that backfired, deploying right back Trent Alexander-Arnold as a central midfielder in the opening 1-0 win over Serbia and 1-1 draw with Denmark.\n\nEngland faces Spain in Sunday's final, one game away from what would be its first men's trophy since winning the 1966 World Cup on home soil.\n\n\"The only reason I took the job was to try and bring success to England as a nation and try and improve English football. To be able to take the team to its first final overseas, I'm immensely proud of that,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"We play the team who have been the best team in the tournament and we have a day less to prepare so it's a huge task. But we're still here and we're fighting.\"\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"},

I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you,\" he said.\n\n\"But we're in a third semifinal in four tournaments, and I think we continue to give people fantastic memories.\n\n\"So, we'll keep grinding, we'll keep fighting, and we'll keep enjoying this journey.\"\n\nThat could be the crux of it.\n\nUnder Southgate England has reached two European Championship finals and a World Cup semifinal, his only \"failure\" being the quarterfinal defeat to eventual 2022 finalists France in Qatar.\n\nNo other England coach has even come close to such a sustained record of achievement.\n\nEven Sir Alf Ramsay, whose performances in his final two tournaments as coach of England in 1972 and 1974 were characterised by \"cautious, joyless football,\" according to journalism great Hugh McIlvanney, showed timidity in embracing the then-new phenomenon of tactical substitutes.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSouthgate was seemingly following England's deified World Cup-winning coach down that path towards irrelevance, until this glorious night in Dortmund.\n\nNot only did Southgate \"release the handbrake\" as so many England fans had demanded -- lining up with three at the back to allow nominal wing-back Buyaka Saka the chance to explore the right flank with impunity -- but his side also displayed the characteristics that he would be most proud of, sheer bloody-mindedness and grit to see the game out.\n\nMuch as they did on home soil in 2021, England has played perfect tournament football -- winning is the only thing that matters, and nobody gets extra points for style in football.\n\nYet in Dortmund, faced with a wall of Dutch supporters, England did turn up the style to something approaching that of want-to-be champions.\n\nEngland started magnificently, pushing the Dutch back and quietening legions of Oranje-clad supporters that flooded Dortmund, colouring the Westfalenstadion's towering s\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne -- made famous by Borussia Dortmund's yellow-wearing support -- with their own unique shade.\n\nBut England still conceded first.\n\nGiven the criticism, given the tepidness of England's misfiring attack at this Euros, the team could have wilted under the sheer weight of the Dutch support, which comfortably occupied three-quarters of the imposingly tight stadium.\n\nInstead, the Three Lions dominated.\n\nDutch coach Ronald Koeman, stinging from his first-ever defeat against England as a player or coach, said: \"They created problems in our midfield in the first half.\"\n\nOf course, there was more than a degree of fortune about the penalty -- Harry Kane philosophically said \"sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't\" when asked about it post-match.\n\nAnd although even the most hardened England supporter would have to admit that, more often than not you don't get those types of penalties, it won't bother them a jolt given how much they dominated afterwards.\n\nSetting up his team for how the Dutch would come out for the second half with the game poised at 1-1, was arguably Southgate's biggest test.\n\nKoeman is not afraid to tinker with his side -- the enforced substitution of striker Memphis Dupay, off with an injury, to be replaced by midfielder Joey Veerman, a case in point.\n\nAfter the break, Koeman did make another switch, bringing on target man Wout Weghorst to add a new dimension to the Dutch attack -- and it worked.\n\nEngland was on the back foot for the first time in the game, the intensity and brilliance of the first-half performance suddenly weighing them down as the players struggled to break through the lines of Dutch defenders.\n\nSo Southgate made a double change.\n\nOff came the irreplaceable Kane, and, despite the anonymity of Jude Bellingham, so did arguably England's best player in the first half, Phil Foden.\n\nBravery takes many forms.\n\nSouthgate, who has spoken before about the demons he had slain from his Euro 96 penalty shootout miss to turn England into an improbable force at spot kicks under his tenure, reached into that well of resilience again.\n\nOn came Ollie Watkins -- a player who 10 years ago was out on loan at non-league Western-super-Mare, struggling to get back in lower league Exeter City's first team -- and Cole Palmer, who left the security of Manchester City's youth set up to forge a new path at Chelsea.\n\nTheir combination as the clock ticked over the 90 minutes sent England into ecstasy and on the path to Berlin.\n\n\"Sometimes it can work that way,\" Southgate told ITV, deflecting his role in England's winner.\n\n\"The most important thing is all of the squad can come into the game. Their attitudes have been exemplary and I'm so happy for Ollie.\n\n\"It was complicated. They kept changing so we had to change.\"\n\nThe ability to change things in-game has not been Southgate's most notable attribute during his tenure -- it's the biggest thing England fans hold against him.\n\nBut even his staunchest critics -- and there have been many -- cannot argue that he got it right today.\n\nChris Sutton, the former England striker, described Southgate's substitutions as \"first class\" on BBC Radio following the match, while another ex-England international, Matt Upson, said the change \"worked perfectly\".\n\n\"England had to suffer for large parts because of the switch Ronald Koeman made,\" ex-England striker Alan Shearer added.\n\n\"They couldn't find a way. It was crying out for a substitute. That man was Ollie Watkins.\n\n\"I was wondering when the changes were going to happen. The changes were right and they were perfect.\n\n\"At times, yes Gareth Southgate has been criticised.\n\n\"But, in that first half tonight I thought it was magnificent, it was more like what we wanted -- he deserves all the credit.\"\n\nHe won't accept it, but there is something he should take credit for if nothing else -- England has shown extraordinary resilience in this tournament: scoring in the final seconds to save the game against Slovakia, scoring five-nerveless penalties to overcome Switzerland and then coming from behind against the Netherlands.\n\nAfter all, if England are to go on and win the tournament -- and that's a big if given how well Spain have played -- will anyone remember how poor England performed in the group stages?\n\n\"This is what we came here to do,\" Southgate told the BBC.\n\n\"We have been building for two years.\n\n\"We have got to enjoy tonight, but equally it is such a quick turn around and we have a day less than the team who have been the best in the tournament.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I felt that shifted once we got into the knockout stage.\"\n\nHe said the players overcame difficulty and showed resilience, with a response he called brilliant, with a desire to make history by winning their first European Championship.\n\n\"You're now into that moment in the tournament where it's what's possible, what's achievable rather than what might go wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"So this is now the chance to make history which we've enjoyed doing.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarEuro 2024: Southgate defends reluctance to use his bench ReutersHow many Russian athletes will take part in Paris 2024 Olympics?

Current England boss Gareth Southgate.\n\nOne of the prevailing narratives of the Southgate reign since he took the job in 2016 is that the ex-Middlesbrough boss had corrected many past issues.\n\nThe sideshows that had impacted English teams in the past -- frosty media relations, players being apprehensive about representing their country owing to the inevitable blowback -- had ostensibly diminished.\n\nSouthgate took over at what was perhaps the nadir for the English football team -- a catastrophic Euro 2016 exit at the hands of Iceland and the brief, controversial, ill-fated reign of Sam Allardyce.\n\nAs a result largely of the 2016 humbling, expectations ahead of the 2018 World Cup were modest. So when the team made it as far as the semi-finals before losing to Croatia, it was a pleasant surprise for their fans and an overachievement in the eyes of many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the three tournaments since then, Southgate has only failed to make the semi-finals once, exiting at the last-eight stage of the 2022 World Cup against France.\n\nConsequently, Southgate has reached the semi-finals at a major tournament three times in six years. Before he took over, England had only achieved this feat on four occasions in their history -- 1966, 1968, 1990 and 1996.\n\nBut if it wasn't already, at this tournament, there is a sense that the extended honeymoon afforded to Southgate is over.\n\nPerhaps it is partially to do with the widespread expectation that Southgate will leave the job after this tournament regardless of the outcome. It is much easier for the media to criticise an outgoing boss than one they need to maintain a good relationship with. And with the fans, the phrase 'familiarity breeds contempt' springs to mind as there has been significant dissent from the stands -- after the 0-0 draw with Slovenia, despite the team topping their group, supporters made their dissatisfaction known by hurling plastic cups of beer at the squad.\n\nPerhaps wisely, the former Aston Villa star has not officially indicated his post-tournament plans.\n\nSouthgate didn't make the same mistake as Bobby Robson, who announced he was leaving the England job before the 1990 World Cup to become PSV boss, prompting media accusations of the much-respected coach being unpatriotic and creating an unsettling environment going into the tournament.\n\nYet there is a sense, from reading between the lines in some of Southgate's comments, that he may feel he is beginning to outstay his welcome.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference this week, the 53-year-old gave the impression that he was fed up.\n\n\"I can't deny that some of the personal nature, you know,\" he said. \"This is a job where you get ridiculed, and your professional capability is questioned beyond belief, and I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you either.\n\n\"But I'm fortunate that my life's taken me through a lot of resilience-building and it's made me more determined and I'm just using it as fuel. I know where I want to take the team to. The team need to see me strong in those moments as well, otherwise that messaging that you're giving them on what they need to be, it doesn't ring true.\"\n\nSome England players have also seemed frustrated with the outside noise.\n\nDeclan Rice and Harry Kane expressed unhappiness following remarks from BBC pundits. Gary Lineker, in an admittedly tongue-in-cheek tone, described their performance versus Denmark as \"shit\".\n\nSteve McClaren was heavily ridiculed after England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 during his reign. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo\n\nIt is arguably the most gifted generation of English players in decades, while the strong record at recent tournaments has led to increased expectations.\n\nSo there are two different schools of thought. Firstly, Southgate has taken a group of perennial underachievers and turned them into overachievers.\n\nConversely, you could argue that he has been fortunate, both with the favourable draws afforded to his team and the exceptional group of players at his disposal, with whom perhaps England should be expecting to reach finals and semi-finals of major tournaments.\n\nSo is Southgate overrated or underrated? Maybe the answer is both.\n\nThe infamous recent Kalvin Phillips comments were widely ridiculed. But for the most part, Southgate has been impeccable in his media dealings.\n\nHis answers to often difficult and provocative questions are usually intelligent and measured. England duty will always be intense, but the former Middlesbrough boss has made life easier for players and created a much better environment than the one he inherited.\n\nSo leadership and emotional intelligence are the primary aspects that have enabled Southgate to become England's most successful manager since World Cup winner Alf Ramsey.\n\nOn the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that tactically, Southgate is not at the very top level in terms of international managers.\n\nHis in-game substitutions have often been criticised -- two key examples are the World Cup 2018 semi-final against Croatia and the Euro 2020 final against Italy -- both games where the Three Lions made excellent starts and went a goal ahead before their opponents wrested control of the game and eventually beat them deservedly.\n\nRead Next Related Reads Has this been a 'bad' Euros? One of the great blockbuster nights in Euros history before England seek to stumble through\n\nEngland did respond well to going behind against Switzerland. Nonetheless, there was the sense of Southgate being reactive rather than proactive -- his first substitutions were made in the 78th minute, shortly after his team went 1-0 down when it had long since become clear his side were being outplayed.\n\nIn a sense, there is also more pressure on players and management than ever. The degree of scrutiny they face is unprecedented for an England team as social media makes harsh criticism almost inescapable.\n\nYet there is also compelling evidence to suggest that Southgate has been given a relatively easy time in the traditional media compared to many of his predecessors.\n\nHe has not been derided as a 'turnip' or denounced as a 'wally with a brolly' like Graham Taylor and Steve McClaren respectively. The invariably positive results have helped in this regard.\n\nBut even someone as widely respected in the game and fairly successful as Bobby Robson had it tough by comparison.\n\nAs Owen Gibson in The Guardian retrospectively noted: \"The Sun was handing out badges demanding that Robson be sacked as early as 1984, but it was in the period following a disappointing European Championship in 1988 that the newspaper campaign to oust him became most heated. This was the Sun in its buccaneering, \"super soaraway\", Kelvin MacKenzie pomp, when circulation was soaring, libel writs were waved away as an occupational hazard and it delighted in its self-made image as the pulse of the man on the street. With the same tenacity and self-righteous fury that would in time be extended to most of those in the public eye, it contrived that the job of England manager should become a vessel for the perceived frustrations of a nation.\"\n\nPerhaps partially owing to the declining influence of newspapers and tabloid media, and the more educated and in turn sympathetic view of the challenges of such a difficult role, the criticism of Southgate has been nowhere near as vicious in print. However it should be noted that there would have been a very different tone to the coverage if Jude Bellingham had not dramatically rescued the Three Lions in the dying seconds from a humiliating round-of-16 exit against Slovakia.\n\nOf course, the onset of social media means the bile players and coaches can be subjected to is arguably as prevalent as ever in a different format.\n\nSouthgate was doubtless aware of these pitfalls when he took the role. He might have made some inevitable mistakes along the way with tactics and personnel. Moreover, some managers could get more out of the underperforming English players. But as is usually pointed out to criticise coaches, it's a results business. In this sense, the regularly under-fire England boss has made the impossible job look easier than most.", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jude Bellingham's stunning overhead kick saved their blushes in the round of 16 against Slovakia and sparked a 2-1 extra-time win, before beating Switzerland on spot-kicks after the quarter-final ended 1-1. \"I took the job to try and improve English football and we're now in a second final,\" Southgate said. \"The last one was the first in 50 years. We're now in the first that isn't played on our shores. \"I think we've got a team that will be together for quite a while, so it's not as though this is a team that's at the end of a cycle. \"We're giving people some amazing nights. I think we've given our supporters some of the best nights over the last 50 years, so I'm hugely proud of that. \"I'm delighted if everybody at home is feeling the way we are and the way the supporters in the stadium are feeling.\n\n\"But from our point of view, we're not finished. We've got the greatest possible test to prepare for and we came here to try and win the tournament, and that's still our aim.\"", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp Soccer", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift Work", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/5YFIBT4rdxcOdlFSyFUyvP/bfca4adfacc79ce531c1e01b6ccb2058/Untitled_design__23_.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

It was a lot more assured, a lot more assertive, a lot more aggressive. When the Dutch scored, there was always an element of 'here we go again,' but England got that slice of luck with the penalty. I'd be very disappointed if that was given against me as a player and I was very surprised that the referee's original decision wasn't upheld. Incredibly fortuitous,\" Stan Collymore said to CaughtOffside for his exclusive column.\n\n\"After that I thought for pretty much the entirety of the match, 70 plus minutes, England were the better team.\n\n\"It shows how far we've come that the expectation in this tournament to date hadn't been met, and for an England team to dominate possession of the ball against the Dutch is quite remarkable - and that may not get commented on as much as it should.\n\n\"It's a massive vindication of the St George's Park project, of English coaches and English coaching, and of the talent that we're now producing.\n\n\"England used to play the Dutch and you'd think to yourself 'how are we going to get the ball back?' and on Wednesday I watched an English team play a Dutch team where the Netherlands players were running around wondering when they were going to get the ball back. That could be a real watershed moment for English football in many ways.\n\n\"I still think that Harry Kane is labouring a little bit, but the main positive is that we now know that another glass ceiling can be broken.\n\n\"The captain of the national team can be taken off and there won't be any sort of division amongst England fans because there are now players coming through - like Ollie Watkins - that can provide those golden moments. That's massive. That's absolutely massive.\n\n\"Credit has to be given to Gareth Southgate because he said all the way through, judge him on results.\n\n\"He's obviously been wounded by some of the personal stuff, which I think is out of order. You can criticise somebody, and we have, rightly so, because of performances, without it being personal.\"\n\nSunday can't come soon enough, and if England want to make history and win the first piece of major silverware since 1966, each and every player has to leave everything on the pitch.\n\nThe last thing anyone wants is for those associated with the national team to think 'if only we could've done this better.'\n\nIt's Southgate's last dance, and a new man in charge might break up this team too.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_pettigrove@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Jason Pettigrove", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George's_Park_National_Football_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St George's Park National Football Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Collymore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stan Collymore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/netherlands-v-england-semi-final-uefa-euro-2024-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The Danes, meanwhile, were jubilant with their point and celebrated wildly with their supporters.\n\nAfter reaching the final of the last Euros and getting to a World Cup semi-final, the expectations have risen. But the by-product has been the pressure on England to win - and win well. Southgate's decision was to hit the reset button with a team meeting before their final Group C game.\n\n\"For me that's been a fascinating experience to see the team have been fearful in the opening part of it, almost concerned about what could go wrong. We haven't had that for a few years,\" said Southgate, whose team can make history by defeating Holland in Dortmund and reach England's first major final on foreign soil.\n\n\"Maybe that was (because of) expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well. But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's possible' sort of mindset. I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that performance to build on and take into this game.\"\n\nSouthgate has seen a different England since the group stages were wrapped up. They were saved by Jude Bellingham against Slovakia in the last-16 but were creating more chances. They were better again when they faced Switzerland in the quarter-finals.\n\nDeclan Rice spoke about the \"reset\" meeting that has been a turning point in the finals. Southgate admitted at the time there were \"honest\" conversations to get back on track.\n\n\"We definitely spoke about it. When you can sense that feeling you need to confront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"In the end we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch. The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the players looking distraught. They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying.\n\n\"Every other team was celebrating with their fans at that and we were on our knees. So I had to correct how they were viewing things. But of course that feeling was being reinforced so vocally and actively outside and I think they were picking up on that too much.\"\n\nSouthgate's attempt to change the mindset of the squad has been a constant operation, reinforcing his messages during the long days at England's basecamp at their Spa & GolfResort Weimarer Land hotel. It means the final team-talk at Westfalenstadion before facing the Dutch may not be a Churchillian speech to send his players out to make history.\n\n\"I haven't decided yet,\" said Southgate. \"For me the messages are constant. We meet with the players all the time. We've had a tactical meeting in the morning before the game. The tone of everything you deliver, the messages behind everything you deliver, the way we talk to them individually on the training pitch, it's constant.\n\n\"I know everybody would love to think there's one speech just before a game that is the bit that makes the difference -- because in the films it is -- but when you're psychologically trying to condition a team it's a 24/7 process and your conscious of getting that tone and those messages right all the time so that actually the last bit should matter less.\n\n\"I still think it's an important moment to get right, but your hitting the players with that all the time and I think it's something we've always thought a lot about as a coaching team.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/3974b60e9483c320c98b8e94acfb0907", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Southgate has proven time and time again that he can reach the latter stages of tournaments.\n\nSouthgate may not be a Pep Guardiola type tactician but Southgate has certainly shown that he can get a lot out of this England group, even if it isn't the most thrilling football to watch.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Ladbrokes 1-2-Free former Manchester United and England defender Phil Jones spoke about Gareth Southgate's qualities and how he believes that Southgate is a good manager.\n\nGareth's always been a brilliant man-manager. He knows how to speak to his players, he knows how to address people. Ultimately, he's proven that he's a very good manager.\n\nI know people will say he's not won this, or he's not won that. But when you look at where we were, compared to where we are... it's a huge progression. Gareth's made a huge impact on this team, and on this nation.\n\nJones was part of some of the early Southgate squads back in 2016. It was at a tumultuous time for English football, just months after being knocked out of Euro 2016 by Iceland and then having the embarrassing Sam Allardyce scandal.\n\nIt certainly wasn't ideal conditions for Gareth Southgate to be taking arguably the biggest job in English football but Jones talked about how from the beginning Southgate had envisioned England's rise.\n\nI remember when he took over, and in his first meeting with the lads, he was showing clips of the World Cup, the actual trophy, and the European trophy too. That was the first meeting we ever had with him, and that's what he had in mind for us.\n\nI can just remember coming out of that meeting with him and thinking 'wow, he's got some big ambitions here'. He outlined that from day one, and the lads have only ever taken it all onboard and understood they're in it for the long haul.\n\nHe may still be short of those ambitions so far in his England tenure but it's hard to deny that Southgate has made a huge impact on the England national team.\n\nNow with England in the semifinals of Euro 2024, England are again just two games away from winning their first major trophy in over 50 years and with the embarrassment of riches Gareth Southgate has on hand, it's going to be hard to stop them.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_browne@balls.ie", "name": "Jonathan Browne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jones_(footballer,_born_1992)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jones (footballer, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Allardyce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Allardyce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wN1xcXC8wOTEyMzMxMlxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24xLmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJlNGE1ODhhZmE4OWIwNTNjZTUyOWJjZWZmYzBjNmQ5YzBjNmNkMmRmIn0=/philjonesonenglandvnetherlandssouthgatesmadeahugeimpactonthenationballsie.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

But the much-maligned side finally showed what they can do against the Netherlands, as a teenage sensation announced himself on the international stage.\n\nEngland have not made many friends at Euro 2024. They have disappointed, underwhelmed and, quite simply, bored spectators for much of the tournament. But one thing nobody can deny the Three Lions is that they roar the loudest when they are under attack.\n\nFor the third time in three knockout ties, England conceded the first goal. For the third time, they were the team that went through. And on this occasion it wasn't a case of one player producing heroics as everyone else desperately flailed around. Instead there were moments, especially in the first half, where England looked like a team, and a good one at that.\n\n\"I was really pleased with the quality of our play,\" England coach Gareth Southgate said. \"It shows the more modern England way, but also the resilience and the character of the group.\"\n\nOllie Watkins' sweet 91st minute strike sent them to Sunday's final, the first at a major tournament that England's men will play on foreign soil. Although they rode their luck at times against the Netherlands, this was finally a performance where England showed flashes of the talent that made them the bookies' favorite in early June.\n\nHowever, the true star of the show was not one of their established big hitters, but Kobbie Mainoo, a 19-year-old who started the tournament as England's fourth choice midfielder. The England fans lucky enough to be in the stands at the Westfalenstadion watched him grow up in front of their eyes.\n\nHe was all over the pitch, setting up chances one minute and breaking up Dutch attacks the next. One flick on the edge of the Netherlands box encapsulated the joie de vivre that has been so sorely lacking in England's game. Playing in a Euros semifinal, in just his eighth game for his country, he had the boldness and confidence to have fun.\n\n\"We haven't really had a player like him until now,\" Southgate said in response to a question from DW. \"I think all of his performances have been exceptional, especially when you consider his age.\"\n\nMainoo linked up especially well down the right hand side with Bukayo Saka, England's saviour in the quarterfinal against Switzerland. Saka's quality and versatility have been key to England's success, providing a major threat on the right wing, while also fitting into more defensive roles as Southgate has adapted his tactics.\n\nMuch like Mainoo, Saka made his England breakthrough at the Euros three years ago aged 19. And like Mainoo now, he was then the youthful spark who reminded England and their fans why they love football. Saka's debut tournament turned sour at the end, when he and several other England players suffered racist abuse online, after missing penalties in the final shootout against Italy.\n\nThat he has been able to continue pushing his career to new heights, in a way that from the outside appears seamless, despite these twin traumas, displays a breathtaking level of mental strength. It's a level that should not be demanded of any player, yet at just 22 years of age, he has not so much overcome these barriers as blown them to pieces. There was much talk of the smile returning to Saka's face after he scored his penalty against Switzerland. But in truth, he never stopped smiling. Young players like Mainoo could not ask for a more impressive role model.\n\nFor all the positivity, England still have issues to deal with. They regressed in the second half, something that Spain will punish much more ruthlessly than the Netherlands were able to. More specifically, two of their best players are still struggling to fit into the system.\n\nJude Bellingham is an enormous talent, who is capable of winning games on his own, as he has done for England at this tournament. But it is contributing to the overall team performance that he's struggling with. After spending the first few matches tripping over Phil Foden's feet as the two naturally gravitated towards similar positions, he now regularly seems isolated when he gets the ball. Perhaps because of this, he often ends up trying to do too much.\n\nEven more baffling is the form of Harry Kane. The Bayern Munich striker was meant to be the most lethal forward in the game right now, and an experienced international star. So the number of times England attacks have ended with Kane belatedly wanders towards the box, as one of his teammates swings in an aimless cross to nobody, is alarming. That it was his replacement Ollie Watkins who scored England's winner, raises the issue of whether Kane should start the final on Sunday, a question that previously would have been unthinkable.\n\nThe problem of Kane's confounding absence from the final third is exacerbated by the lack of a true wide player on the left flank. Kieran Trippier, understandably for someone who usually plays as a right-back, prefers to come inside rather than go on the overlap. In any case, since Southgate moved Foden inside, there's rarely anyone there for him to overlap anyway. Instead there is a yawning chasm of green; space that opposition defences simply don't have to mark. Left-footed Luke Shaw came on at half-time and may be fit for the final.\n\nBut for now, England fans can put these concerns to one side and relish the prospect of their second Euros final in a row, which also happens to be their second ever. \"We've given our supporters some of their best nights of the last 50 years,\" Southgate said.\n\nThey will be underdogs against a Spain side that has the swagger of champions, but England could yet deliver fans their best night since 1966.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Welle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/69628523_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

So it shows the more modern England way,\" said a beaming Southgate afterwards.\n\nThe ultimate test lies ahead against a Spain side that have swept all before them, including Germany and France on the tougher side of the draw.\n\nEngland have previously suffered a series of near misses under Southgate.\n\nThey defied expectations to reach the semi-finals at the 2018 World Cup before missing out on penalties to Italy in the Euro 2020 final on home soil.\n\nMore heartbreak came in Qatar two years ago when Harry Kane ballooned over a late penalty against France in a 2-1 quarter-final defeat.\n\nBut that experience has put them in a better place than ever before to become champions of Europe for the first time.\n\n\"We're more calm going into the knockout games because the first time we did it in Russia, we hadn't won a knockout game for 10 years,\" added Southgate.\n\n\"We hadn't been through the experience. Quarter-finals, semi-finals, we've managed a lot of those games now.\n\n\"The last final was the first European Championship final I've ever managed.

The Three Lions came from behind to win in Dortmund after Harry Kane's controversial penalty cancelled out Xavi Simons' stunning opener. Aston Villa star Ollie Watkins then fired home a dramatic stoppage time winner to tee-up Sunday's finale. But Southgate believes his side are already on the back foot.\n\nSpain took on France in their own semi-final on Tuesday, meaning that they have already had an extra day to recuperate. Explaining how his team plans on navigating that challenge, he said: \"It's not as simple as us having the ball and making them run.\n\n\"They press very, very well so we're going to have to be exceptional with the ball and we're going to have to be exceptional without it. It's a final so you expect it to be that way. They've been the best team. We're starting to show a better version of ourselves.\n\n\"The extra day [of rest for Spain] is a concern, in the last few tournaments that's been a problem for finalists. We've got to do the very best we can to recover the players as well as we can.\n\n\"We're not going to be on the training ground, that's simple. We'll be walking through things or delivering things in meetings, it was the same for this game, but we're in there and with what we've shown to this point, we have as good a chance as they do.\"\n\nWhat team should England name vs Spain? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\nSouthgate certainly has plenty of thinking to do ahead of Sunday's clash at the Olympiastadion. And while it looks set to be an anxiety-filled evening for all of a Three Lions' allegiance, they have already been given encouragement by Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman.\n\nHe has predicted that England could potentially get the better of Spain despite their advantage. Speaking after his side's defeat on Wednesday, he said: \"England showed great football in the first half after being 1-0 down.\n\n\"It's football. If you watch all the matches of the Spanish national team they are more offensive with wingers and [playing] football from the back and ball position and you need to stop that.\n\n\"But England are in the final and have the possibility to win it. Maybe from the outside because Spain are playing from a high level [they are favourites] but England can stop them, why not.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Stats reveal how England fare against their rivals after Cole Palmer and Ollie Watkins helped Three Lions reach the final", "body": "LISTEN to It's All Kicking Off! EUROS DAILY: How England are on the cusp of immortality\n\nGareth Southgate has copped plenty of criticism during his tenure at the helm for England, but one area of frustration for fans and pundits alike has been his use of substitutions.\n\nIt largely stems from England's Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy, with the generally held perception claiming that the Three Lions were too negative after taking the lead and failed to react to Italian changes.\n\nThat criticism has followed Southgate in the next few years, and had been a point of contention in Germany in the knockout stages, with England now twice going through extra time to find a way through.\n\nIvan Toney was notably left fuming at being brought on in added time to change the game against Slovakia, while only 10 nations had been slower to make substitutions before the quarter-finals than the Three Lions.\n\nBut on Wednesday night it was two substitutes combining that saw England make their way into the finals with Ollie Watkins teed up by Cole Palmer in the 91st minute - so is Southgate actually getting his subs right?\n\nGareth Southgate has copped criticism for his late substitutions during his time at the helm\n\nLate introductions Ollie Watkins (left) and Cole Palmer (right) combined for the winner on Wednesday\n\nWell the numbers would suggest so - no nation at the European Championship has had more goals, successful penalties in shootouts or assists from subs than England, surprisingly.\n\nWatkins' late strike was the first to be scored by an English substitute at the Euros, with Germany leading the way on four, followed by Netherlands and Spain (three) and Turkey (two). with eight others tied with England on one.\n\nHowever, for assists the Three Lions are right back up there with two. Palmer's on Wednesday joins Toney's nod on to Harry Kane for the winner against Slovakia in extra time in the Round of 16.\n\nAustria, Germany, Spain and Netherlands have also managed a couple of assists from subs, while Croatia and Turkey have had one each.\n\nSimilarly, with shootout goals England are in top spot with three successfully converted penalties, France also managing as many.\n\nSwitzerland have two, having taken part in the same 12-yard showdown as the Three Lions, with Manuel Akanji's miss condemning them to a quarter-final exit.\n\nPalmer, Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold all converted from the spot, with Bukayo Saka banishing his own ghosts of Euro 2020 and Jude Bellingham stepping up with aplomb as England put all five kicks past Yann Sommer.\n\nOf course, not every team has been in a shootout, but that does not mean Southgate's substitutions have not had an impact.\n\nImpact from subs at Euro 2024\n\nMost sub goals at Euro 2024:\n\nGermany 4\n\nNetherlands, Spain 3\n\nTurkey 2\n\nAlbania, Austria, England, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine 1\n\nMost sub assists at Euro 2024:\n\nAustria, England, Germany, Spain, Netherlands 2\n\nCroatia, Turkey 1\n\nSub shootout goals at Euro 2024:\n\nEngland, France 3\n\nSwitzerland 2\n\nEngland beat Netherlands 2-1 in dramatic fashion to book their place in a second successive Euros final\n\nIvan Toney (right) assisted the winner in the game against Slovakia after coming off the bench\n\nIt's important to note that Saka, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford missed their penalties in the final in 2021 after being brought on in extra time with little time to prepare, indicating that Southgate might have learned that particular lesson.\n\nThe numbers highlight that bringing on Toney and Palmer has been a very useful move for Southgate to rely on, both players netting in the shootout and grabbing an assist as their introductions pay dividends.", "source":

Another final. One more game. One last push.\n\nBefore we think about what comes next, the fact we are here, again, is worth savouring. I turned 50 before I saw England reach a major men's final in my lifetime, and now we are into our second in the past three years, and our first ever on foreign soil.\n\nJust getting here should be a reason for celebration but Gareth Southgate has already changed the narrative so that the expectation is for us to go deep into these tournaments, and of course everyone wants the next step.\n\nNow England just have to go and finish it off, to get over the line and give us the ending that everyone wants, the one with Harry Kane lifting the trophy at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.\n\nAs an England player, captain, fan or pundit, these are the moments I have dreamed of, and hopefully Sunday's Euro 2024 showdown with Spain will turn out to be a very special day.\n\nWe are going to play the best team in the tournament, who have won all six games without needing penalties, and have been so impressive with everything they have done, but there are still reasons to think this England team can win and put themselves in the history books.\n\nFor starters, you know Gareth and his players will believe they can do it. They have always made it clear they have come to this tournament to win it, and that confidence has never wavered.\n\nOur performances in Germany have not always backed that up, but even when we were not playing well there have been other ways where we have shown why we have gone the distance, and why we have an incredible chance in the final as well.\n\nI'm talking about the character to come from behind and find a way to win in all three knock-out ties, the big moments from individuals to score such vital late goals and those perfect penalties under pressure in the shootout with Switzerland.\n\nWe've got players who have changed games from the bench and, dare I say it, we've had a bit of luck along the way - like when Xherdan Shaqiri hit the woodwork in the final seconds of our quarter-final against the Swiss, or the awful penalty decision that went our way against the Netherlands.\n\nThose sort of moments cost us in the past - I remember watching Chris Waddle hitting the post in extra-time of our World Cup semi-final against West Germany in 1990 and being on the pitch when Darren Anderton did the same at Euro '96 - so it's nice when things go our way.\n\nOh, and we have showed we can play a bit, too. As I said in my commentary for Radio 5 Live, the way we responded to going a goal down in Dortmund against the Dutch was perfect, really.\n\nEngland upped the tempo and the pace of our passing, showed energy and intent and really stretched Ronald Koeman's side in the first half by playing high up the pitch. It was definitely the best we have played at these Euros, and was exactly what I'd been waiting for from this team.\n\nI know we also had to suffer, for example in the second half when we dropped back and lost our intensity, but you are never going to control games for 90 minutes at this level.\n\nIt can be draining watching England with the way games ebb and flow, and I am sure it will be the same story for spells against Spain, but tactically we will be ready for whatever they throw at us.\n\nA lot has been made of the noise around England at this tournament, and how the players have been responding to their critics, myself and the other BBC pundits included.\n\nWhen you analyse it, however, no-one has really said anything different to what the squad have said themselves when they have not played well.\n\nLike us, they knew they could do better... and they have improved. Gareth said himself that the performance against Switzerland was England's best so far, and then said the same again after the semi-final.\n\nYou can never please everyone, though. I know there are lots of people on social media still questioning Kane, saying he should not start against Spain, but I thought he played well in the first half against the Dutch, when he had one shot brilliantly saved.\n\nWhatever you think about the penalty decision that England got, he was there to take the initial shot that led to the foul being given, and then he has stuck his spot-kick away and is now joint-top scorer at the tournament with three goals.\n\nOllie Watkins asked different questions when he replaced Kane and won the match for us by running behind the Dutch defence, but starting a game is very different to making an impact like that off the bench.\n\nI have no doubt that Gareth will stick with Harry for the final, and rightly so, but we also know we have players who are ready to come on and make a difference if needed. Our squad is another reason I am really encouraged about what is to come.\n\nAs well as a real depth of talent, the other thing this England squad has in abundance is togetherness and team spirit.\n\nIt has served them well over the past few weeks and helped them find the answers to the problems they have faced, and they are going to need more of the same on Sunday.\n\nThis is a different Spain side to the one of a few years ago who would have 70% or 80% of possession, but they will still want to dominate the ball and they have some incredible individual players like Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Rodri, who hardly ever loses a game these days for club or country.\n\nThere are going to be intense individual battles but England have got players who can hurt Spain too, and we possess another quality which will be crucial - fearlessness. Our younger players like Kobbie Mainoo and Marc Guehi certainly won't be intimidated by the opposition, or the occasion.\n\nThis England team is on the brink of something very special and Sunday is their chance to make that happen.

The trains would be the first and most obvious one, and perhaps the most consistent option too.\n\nBut soon after the creaking public transport system - which went beyond bent and firmly into broken territory in Dortmund in the hours following the Euro 2024 semi-final - on the list of oft-repeated late occurrences would be England goals.\n\nGareth Southgate's side have not always thrilled at the tournament this summer, but that hasn't meant a lack drama - far from it, thanks to those final-minutes efforts.\n\nWithout them, they would not have progressed beyond any of their three knockout games: Jude Bellingham's last-16 bicycle kick, Bukayo Saka's quarter-final equaliser and now Ollie Watkins' last-minute winner in the last four.\n\nAs with anything else in the condensed world of international football, these goals can be used to shape arguments in many different ways, but perhaps the Three Lions boss summed it up best when he referred to traits within the squad which have seen them come closer together, work collectively and, again and again, find a way.\n\n\"Character. I think definitely tonight we didn't deserve to be behind, it was a moment [of brilliance]. We'd started the game really well. with the ball we were exceptional, caused a lot of problems [for Netherlands],\" Southgate said.\n\n\"I was really pleased with the quality of our play - it would be a long time since England had 60 per cent possession against a side from Netherlands. It shows the modern England way but also the resilience in the group.\"\n\nResilience, character, mentality.\n\nSouthgate has brought up those traits at regular intervals during the course of the tournament, particularly in the knockout stages - and why wouldn't he? It's hard to argue against England's penchant for overcoming setbacks and difficulties, even if the fact they get themselves into those situations can at times be criticised.\n\nIf the tactics have been derided, the starting players questioned, Southgate himself doubted and even their opponents dismissed by some, the simple guiding principle of doing whatever it takes to win cannot be taken lightly.\n\nAs a one-off occurrence - Italy's leveller against Croatia to go through the groups, say - late goals are an exceptional addition to any game, swinging emotion as much as momentum and changing the course of the tournament.\n\nBut to find as many ways to do it late on as England have, in such a short space of time? That has to be something more.\n\nMentality encompasses so much, though. The character and resilience that Southgate speaks of, yes, but also expectation among the players themselves, almost a certainty which lingers beyond the 90 minutes that they can, and will, find a way.\n\nThe other intriguing aspect is of how many variations in England's late goals there have been. These aren't all set-pieces or hail Mary balls into the box, or even from a defined area of the pitch or player type: a cross, a solo dribble, an incisive pass and stunning finish. Add in the perfect penalty shootout and Harry Kane's extra-time header against Slovakia, and the variance becomes even more impressive.\n\nStarters and substitutes have found the net. Strikers and support players. All types have contributed and each have deserved their chance, Southgate pointed out.\n\n\"Ollie Watkins has trained like that every day and he's waited for his moment. No matter his frustration at not playing, he's been ready. The whole group have,\" he said.\n\n\"Half of them have never been to a tournament but they've bonded so well, they all have each other's back and tonight was a great example of that.\"\n\nCertainly, the sight of the bench flooding onto the pitch when Watkins buried his winner was a testament to that ethos and togetherness.\n\nBut it's in the everyday moments that Southgate also sees that spirit, with Bukayo Saka's performance in particular drawing praise.\n\n\"It was a complicated game as they were changing the way they build up, so we had to change how we defend. We kept looking for different solutions but the players were brilliant. [Bukayo] Saka was a wing-back, then had to go into midfield then he was defending as a winger,\" the manager explained.\n\nAnd if that's the type of job for the team one of the squad's best players is willing to put in, to either create his own moment or allow someone else to, it cannot be a surprise that everyone else is following suit, on the training pitch and, when their chance comes, in matches.\n\nLate goals aren't always enough by themselves, and relying upon them naturally has its drawbacks. But aside from the manic celebrations and tournament progressions they yield, perhaps for Southgate and England they are something else entirely: proof of the spirit in the team as much as the quality, proof that this time they have the mindset to finish the job.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It also has a greater meaning.\n\nIn the elated aftermath of his side's 2-1 semi-final victory over the Netherlands, Southgate enthused about traditional continental qualities like an England team that \"had 60 per cent of the ball against the Netherlands\", to go with so many modern sports science approaches that have fired this team so far. There was also something quintessentially English about this, though.\n\nWhen foreign players and managers have talked about the Premier League and the divisions below it, they have often been struck by the ferocity of the competitiveness - the willingness to keep going; a perseverance. That has been marketed in the modern world as \"anyone can beat anyone\" but has referred to the honest will of English sides. This wasn't always complimentary, either. It was occasionally spoken of as if there was a naivety to it. This was seen as blustering stars wastefully chasing lost causes, as a force that expended energy.\n\nBy the same token, there has always been a respect for how English sides have kept going until the end.\n\nThis is a trait that Southgate and his staff have now properly focused and honed, through strategy and science. It has also meant that a phrase to sum up England's campaign - and is starting to be said around the camp - is that it isn't how you start, it's how you finish.\n\nThat applies to virtually everything about the squad's Euro 2024 campaign, from the goals and the players used, to the matches themselves and even the entire tournament.\n\nYou only have to consider how all those complaints and debates from the group stage now seem irrelevant. England got through all that and those flaws actually ended up serving to strengthen the squad. Their persistence brought resolve.\n\nThat was bolstered by how they got through those matches, too, which all involved invigorating late drama in different ways. For the Slovakia last-16 match, it was a scarcely believable 95th-minute overhead kick equaliser to keep England in the tournament. For the Switzerland quarter-final, it was penalties in a shoot-out, but all taken with a supreme confidence that only added to belief rather than nerves. For the Netherlands semi-final, then, there was a vintage late winner.\n\nThat isn't just a way to get through. It's a way to feel your name is on the trophy.\n\nThere are then the actual names involved, and how they were used. As Southgate has made such a point of stressing, so many have been players who had to wait for their chance. Ivan Toney set up the last-16 winner, before scoring a crucial penalty in the quarter-final. Cole Palmer and Trent Alexander-Arnold stepped up, too, before Ollie Watkins claimed that swishing finish against the Dutch.\n\nAll of this illustrates something else, directly related to how England start those games. For all the commotion about the XI picked for kick-off, that simply doesn't matter as much as it used to because modern international matches are so intense and tactical, and the modern England have so much talent. The demands of all games mean they involve multiple subs anyway. In the Dutch game alone, there were two major tactical switches, with both managers responding to each other. There are plenty of different players you can use. It might be England's greatest strength and maybe their single main advantage over Spain.\n\nSouthgate has more individual talent to bring on and change things. That might be essential if the game goes as expected and Spain seek to exhaust England through pure possession.\n\nIt also means there probably isn't much point in expending energy on what is set to be one of the huge debates in the build-up to the final. That is whether to drop Harry Kane.\n\nPeople can forget about that. It's just not going to happen. It also doesn't really matter in the way it used to. This isn't Tottenham Hotspur in the 2019 Champions League final. England have different options. Southgate can, of course, put on his most dependable striker for a major career moment, but then has the option to try something different. It may even be extra useful for the final in that it could suddenly give Spain a different tactical problem to solve at a crucial moment. Having Watkins or Toney running in behind could be seismic in a match where a high-lined defence has mostly been dealing with Kane's positioning.\n\nSomeone might be in better condition to offer the finish required. English teams have long gone right to the end, although often chasing lost causes. It has been the story of so many failures.

But Southgate knew what he was doing all along, and on walked Ollie Watkins.\n\nThe Aston Villa man was an instant game-changer, bursting onto the field with energy and a desire to make a difference. Watkins - who was playing in the Championship for Brentford just four years ago, in non-league with Weston-super-Mare just before that - kept England's dreams alive and etched his name into the history books, where he will sit alongside the likes of Paul Gascoigne and Michael Owen as England's memorable goalscoring magicians.\n\nSouthgate also managed to work out what once looked impossible - unlocking the best version of Phil Foden in this England side. The Manchester City star had been berated for his performances in earlier stages of the tournament, often struggling to earn his way in the team.\n\nBut the England boss knew that Foden's skills just had to be unlocked, and bringing Kobbie Mainoo into the midfield alongside Declan Rice earlier in the knockout rounds was just the ticket.\n\nMainoo, who may just become one of England's most vital players in years to come, helped to maximise Foden's technical ability, creating chances for the fellow Stockport native while also enabling more ball progression.\n\nMainoo and Foden's combination play has been what England have needed the entire way through the tournament and against the Netherlands we finally got to see what every fan had craved.\n\nIt wasn't just in attack where Southgate utilised his know-how either. For so long team's have identified England's desire to sit back and cling on. Not anymore. When Marc Guehi's suspension forced Southgate to consider a three-man backline, no one knew just how much this would shape the future success of the team.\n\nSuddenly, England were laced with the ability to push onwards, challenging down the wings while leaving minimal players in defence. The semi-final backline of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Guehi just clicked, and the introduction of Luke Shaw in the second half added even more balance to the team.\n\nShaw's arrival shortly after the restart at half-time also marked the longest he's played since February - hinting that a full recovery is imminent at an opportune time.\n\nEngland will have a battle on their hands when they face Spain on Sunday. But with Southgate at the helm, truly anything is possible.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Gascoigne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Gascoigne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-League_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-League football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentford_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brentford F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Spanish Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stockport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stockport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6115,h_3439,x_0,y_124/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01j2gkdhtnwc8gpah40r.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

However, England reached a new level to beat Netherlands 2-1 in the semi-finals on Wednesday, with Southgate's changes proving pivotal.\n\nThe former England midfielder brought on Ollie Watkins and Cole Palmer in the 81st minute, and the latter provided the assist for Watkins's 91st-minute winner - to set up a final against Spain.\n\n\"Sometimes it can work that way,\" Southgate told ITV after the game in Dortmund. \"The most important thing is that all of the squad is ready to come into the game.\n\n\"You spend a lot of time with those lads, and their attitude has been exemplary. I'm so chuffed for Ollie.\"\n\nWatkins's arrival surprised some fans, not only because the Aston Villa striker replaced captain Harry Kane, but because Ivan Toney seemed a likelier replacement.\n\n\"We just felt, energy-wise, we were starting to lose a bit of pressure,\" Southgate explained. \"Harry got that knock in the first half as well. Ollie can press well, he can make those little runs in behind that he did [for the goal].\n\n\"But also, it's a different game. The opponent gave us a little more space; in the early games, we didn't have any space to play.\"\n\nSouthgate, 53, also suggested that reaching the Euro 2024 final is his team's \"best\" achievement, three years after they were runners-up to Italy in the final of the delayed Euro 2020.

Southgate, who is preparing for the third semi-final of his eight-year reign, delivered a rabble-rousing message ahead of England's showdown with Holland.\n\nThree Lions boss Southgate said: \"We've risen well to those challenges over the years and used them as motivation to break new ground. We've never been to a final outside our own shores. These are opportunities to make a difference and that's how we have to look at it. We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before.\n\n\"We've got to use this opportunity to change history as a motivation and that's how the players see it. It's about their moment now, nothing that's gone on in the past, none of that is their fault or concern.\n\n\"We've gone further in more recent tournaments. But nobody is thinking that is anywhere near enough. Now we're in the real business end of the tournament which of course given that's only the third time in however many years, that's not to be underestimated.\n\n\"But for us as a group, the great thing is we're not sitting here happy with a semi-final, we want to go further and our aim is to come here and win it and we are now two games away from doing that.\"\n\nEngland reached the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup, lost the last Euros final to Italy after a penalty shootout but now history beckons. Southgate is convinced the squad has grown in belief and togetherness and insisted any of them could end up being the match-winning hero as they look to book a place in Sunday's final in Berlin.\n\nSouthgate added: \"It really is this group of players who have come together well over the last three or four weeks. They know it's possible to come into these games and be in these games at crucial times. They've been outstanding in the way they've dealt with all of that.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It is that unflappable nature which remains his best quality.\n\nWhile his predecessors would have crumpled and allowed a sense of paranoia to cripple their teams, England's players, outwardly at least, thanks largely to their manager, have maintained a level of calm that has belied some of the perilous situations they have found themselves in of late.\n\nAs results and performances have improved, so too has Southgate's decision making, culminating in last night's win which represented the best managerial performance of his career.\n\nA goal down early on, courtesy of an uncharacteristic Declan Rice error, England appeared set for a night to forget. Not a bit of it.\n\nFar more fluent and composed in the 3-4-2-1 formation that looks a perfect fit for England's attacking players, the Three Lions shrugged off that early setback and clawed their way back into the contest.\n\nAn equaliser may have been the product of a ludicrous penalty decision that was branded a disgrace by Gary Neville, but a goal on the balance of play was merited.\n\nEngland's twin 10s, Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, buzzed with intent, Bukayo Saka and Kyle Walker worked in tandem on the right flank while Kobbie Mainoo, parachuted into the starting XI after England's insipid first two group games, cemented his status as the breakthrough midfield talent of the tournament.\n\nIndeed, so dominant had Southgate's men been that it was almost a disappointment that they went in level at the break.\n\nThe second half was a far more turgid, attritional affair that threatened to turn into the sort of stalemate that often renders 30 minutes of extra time and a penalty shootout inevitable.\n\nRonald Koeman is a canny and savvy manager who delights in frustrating his opposition and so it transpired that the Dutch began to strangle England.\n\nSouthgate in the past has been accused of allowing matches of this nature to drift and proven to be incapable of making the sort of in-game changes that can shift momentum.\n\nWith Harry Kane labouring up front and Foden's spark burning out, would Southgate be brave enough to hook England's most likely matchwinners?\n\nWhile Roberto Martinez was left to count the cost of pandering to Cristiano Ronaldo's gargantuan ego, Southgate was pragmatic enough to realise that the game required Ollie Watkins' ability to stretch the backline and Cole Palmer's daring, playmaking abilities.\n\nIt was the sort of double substitution that managers dream of as the pair combined to produce a winning goal of rare quality and a picture book moment that will go down in English sporting folklore.\n\nAn even sterner test awaits Southgate on Sunday. England's women were out passed, outmanoeuvred and ultimately outclassed by their Spanish counterparts in the World Cup final last summer.\n\nThe evidence of the last month suggests this weekend's showpiece occasion could follow a similar pattern but in Southgate 2.0 England have their best ever chance of breaking their men's trophy drought.\n\nMORE : Gareth Southgate reveals 'concern' over

It also has a greater meaning.\n\nIn the elated aftermath of his side's 2-1 semi-final victory over the Netherlands, Southgate enthused about traditional continental qualities like an England team that \"had 60 per cent of the ball against the Netherlands\", to go with so many modern sports science approaches that have fired this team so far. There was also something quintessentially English about this, though.\n\nWhen foreign players and managers have talked about the Premier League and the divisions below it, they have often been struck by the ferocity of the competitiveness - the willingness to keep going; a perseverance. That has been marketed in the modern world as \"anyone can beat anyone\" but has referred to the honest will of English sides. This wasn't always complimentary, either. It was occasionally spoken of as if there was a naivety to it. This was seen as blustering stars wastefully chasing lost causes, as a force that expended energy.\n\nBy the same token, there has always been a respect for how English sides have kept going until the end.\n\nThis is a trait that Southgate and his staff have now properly focused and honed, through strategy and science. It has also meant that a phrase to sum up England's campaign - and is starting to be said around the camp - is that it isn't how you start, it's how you finish.\n\nThat applies to virtually everything about the squad's Euro 2024 campaign, from the goals and the players used, to the matches themselves and even the entire tournament.\n\nYou only have to consider how all those complaints and debates from the group stage now seem irrelevant. England got through all that and those flaws actually ended up serving to strengthen the squad. Their persistence brought resolve.\n\nThat was bolstered by how they got through those matches, too, which all involved invigorating late drama in different ways. For the Slovakia last-16 match, it was a scarcely believable 95th-minute overhead kick equaliser to keep England in the tournament. For the Switzerland quarter-final, it was penalties in a shoot-out, but all taken with a supreme confidence that only added to belief rather than nerves. For the Netherlands semi-final, then, there was a vintage late winner.\n\nThat isn't just a way to get through. It's a way to feel your name is on the trophy.\n\nThere are then the actual names involved, and how they were used. As Southgate has made such a point of stressing, so many have been players who had to wait for their chance. Ivan Toney set up the last-16 winner, before scoring a crucial penalty in the quarter-final. Cole Palmer and Trent Alexander-Arnold stepped up, too, before Ollie Watkins claimed that swishing finish against the Dutch.\n\nAll of this illustrates something else, directly related to how England start those games. For all the commotion about the XI picked for kick-off, that simply doesn't matter as much as it used to because modern international matches are so intense and tactical, and the modern England have so much talent. The demands of all games mean they involve multiple subs anyway. In the Dutch game alone, there were two major tactical switches, with both managers responding to each other. There are plenty of different players you can use. It might be England's greatest strength and maybe their single main advantage over Spain.\n\nSouthgate has more individual talent to bring on and change things. That might be essential if the game goes as expected and Spain seek to exhaust England through pure possession.\n\nIt also means there probably isn't much point in expending energy on what is set to be one of the huge debates in the build-up to the final. That is whether to drop Harry Kane.\n\nPeople can forget about that. It's just not going to happen. It also doesn't really matter in the way it used to. This isn't Tottenham Hotspur in the 2019 Champions League final. England have different options. Southgate can, of course, put on his most dependable striker for a major career moment, but then has the option to try something different. It may even be extra useful for the final in that it could suddenly give Spain a different tactical problem to solve at a crucial moment. Having Watkins or Toney running in behind could be seismic in a match where a high-lined defence has mostly been dealing with Kane's positioning.\n\nSomeone might be in better condition to offer the finish required. English teams have long gone right to the end, although often chasing lost causes. It has been the story of so many failures. That narrative may now have a different ending, for a success that has so much modern and continental influence, but with that quintessentially English twist.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/11/08/newFile-3.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

So to be able to celebrate the second final is very, very special.\"\n\nSouthgate also praised the fans, adding: \"If I hadn't been on the grass, I'd have been watching, celebrating like they were. We are kindred spirits in many ways but of course, I'm the one who has to pick a team. So to be able to give them a night like tonight, it's very special.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_downham@ok.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Downham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article33219613.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Netherlands-v-England-Semi-Final-UEFA-EURO-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

In the last few tournaments, it has been a problem for finalists. We've got to do the very best we can to recover the players as well as we can.\"\n\nSpain already poses a monumental challenge to England's hopes of winning only the second major tournament in its history, following the 1966 World Cup.\n\nLuis de la Fuente's side, the 2008 and 2012 Euros champion, has won six straight games here in Germany, has scored a competition-high 13 goals (to England's seven), and has a 16-year-old phenom in Lamine Yamal.\n\nAdd in the physical challenge involved with a tight turnaround at the end of a month-long tournament -- at the end of a grueling club season -- and you can see why Southgate thinks it is a potential problem.\n\nThe last three Euros finals -- England's penalties defeat to Italy, Portugal's victory over France to hand Cristiano Ronaldo his sole major tournament title and Spain beating Italy 4-0 in 2012 -- have all gone to the team that played in the first semifinal, each time contested a day earlier than the other.\n\nThe World Cup has been the same story, with the last three titles all going to the first, and more rested semifinalist. Argentina and Lionel Messi had an extra day's break relative to France in Qatar in 2022 and will do so again in the Copa America final against Colombia on Sunday.\n\nIn 2018, France was a day more rested than World Cup opponent Croatia. Germany, likewise, against Argentina in 2014.\n\n\"Now it is one more game,\" attacker Jude Bellingham told reporters. \"We are tired, it has been a long season, but this is one last push for our country and for history.\"\n\nThe perceived disadvantage is not something England's players will want to dwell on too much ahead of what England star Phil Foden said \"will be the biggest game of my life.\"\n\nFatigue is a factor in modern soccer, however, and it should be noted that both of England's knockout games leading up to the semifinal went 120 minutes, with extra time required.\n\n\"The lads are signing in the dressing room, but they are straight in the ice,\" Southgate added. \"There won't be any wild parties, we've had a couple of those already -- we pick our moments for those.\n\n\"We are still here and we are fighting. We have to get the ball off Spain first. It's not as simple as us having the ball and making them run.\n\n\"They press very, very well, so we're going to have to be exceptional with the ball and we're going to have to be exceptional without it. It's a final, so you expect it to be that way.\n\n\"They've been the best team. We're starting to show a better version of ourselves.\"\n\nAfter beating the Dutch to reach a first major final on foreign soil, England have now come from behind in each of its three games in the elimination bracket. While trailing is clearly not an ideal scenario, the response has undoubtedly provided a confidence boost to a team that was heavily criticized for its uninspiring play in the group stage.\n\n[Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?

Shoppers in the city centre were on a high after England clinched a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands in Wednesday's semi-final match.\n\nThe victory came from a 90th minute goal from Ollie Watkins, and with a place in the final secured against Spain fans are bracing themselves for either a victory like 1966 or a painful disappointment like 2021. Coventry Live spoke to football fans across the city centre about the historic win after England made history reaching back-to-back European Championship finals- and what they think England's chances of winning the final are.\n\nMartin and Patrick spoke to us outside The Flying Standard pub in Coventry. Chatting about the latest win, Martin said the atmosphere at his local community centre was \"mad.\" He told us: \"It was up and down with that early goal but I knew we'd get back. We were all over them in the first half. The second half Southgate had to keep adjusting the team to get it.\"\n\nRead more No big screen in Coventry centre for Euros final - but pubs can stay open late\n\nAs for how we will fare on Sunday, Martin added: \"Spain are a good side. Everyone is talking them up and it's gonna be a tough game but I think we can win it.\" He spoke highly of Southgate and described him as \"the best manager since we won the World Cup\", adding: \"We've always been a nearly team.\n\n\"We've been to the semi-final of a world cup, we got to the final or the Euros and we should've won that. We were too defensive but Gareth's changed the tactics so I think we're gonna go for it.\"\n\nBy the cathedral, John Kelly was rushing through town. After watching the match at home last night, he called it \"their best game of the tournament\".\n\nHe told us: \"The first half was excellent. They tired a bit in the second half and Holland came into the game more but it was a great performance.\n\n\"I think Gareth Southgate is a decent man and he's proving to be a good manager. He's taken a lot of criticism but he's created a strong bond in the team. They didn't really impress in the group stage so I was a bit sceptical but to get to the final is better than I expected.\"\n\nJohn said for him, Bukayo Saka and Kyle Walker had been standout players this tournament. He is planning to find somewhere to watch the game on Sunday.\n\n\"If we win, the mood will be really uplifting. I think it'll be very celebratory with a lot of relief and pride as well.\"\n\nOn a bench beneath the Godiva clock, Sandra Oswin was taking a break during a shopping trip to town.

Like the team's play throughout the tournament, the win was far from assured and required a last-minute goal from substitute Ollie Watkins. On Sunday in Berlin they'll face a dynamic Spanish team and its teenage sensation Lamine Yamal, who turns 17 on Saturday.\n\nWednesday's victory brought an outpouring of emotions - joy, relief, wonder - and a plea from the monarch for a little less drama on Sunday.\n\n\"If I may encourage you to secure victory before the need for any last minute wonder-goals or another penalties drama, I am sure the stresses on the nation's collective heart rate and blood pressure would be greatly alleviated,\" King Charles III said in a statement.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer, only days into the job after a stunning victory by the Labour Party in last week's election, basked in the reflected glory during the NATO summit in Washington.\n\nMr. Starmer watched part of the game with the Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof. Just as it ended, Mr. Starmer rushed off for a face-to-face meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House. Mr. Biden ignored reporters' questions about his own future but was happy to talk about England's win. \"Good news,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I'll tell you what, it's all because of the Prime Minister.\"\n\nTo which Mr. Starmer quipped: \"We have not lost a game under the Labour government in 2024.\"\n\nThe new Prime Minister is also facing calls to declare a national holiday if England should win, which might even earn the support of people in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland whose teams either didn't make the tournament or in the case of the Scots didn't make it beyond the group stage.\n\n\"We should certainly mark the occasion, I don't want to jinx it. I went to the last Euros final, I don't want to go through that again,\" Mr. Starmer said on Thursday, referring to the last final, which England lost in a penalty shootout.\n\nFor England's manager, Gareth Southgate, there was more than a little vindication in reaching the final. His tactics have been questioned throughout the tournament and after one game a few angry fans pelted him with beer cups. Now he's being hailed as a genius for his decision to replace England legend Harry Kane late in the match with the young upstart Mr. Watkins.\n\n\"We all want to be loved, right?\" Mr. Southgate told reporters after the win. \"When you are doing something for your country and you are a proud Englishman and when you don't feel that back and get all the criticism it is hard.\"\n\nAs for the fans back home, he added with a smile; \"I hope they are enjoying a few beers.\"\n\nMr. Southgate and many others connected with the team will also be hoping that Sunday's game will help erase the ugliness from the final three years ago in London, when England lost on penalty shots to Italy. A trio of English players, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, who are all Black, faced a torrent of online abuse after they missed their shots.\n\nOnly Mr. Saka is back with the team and all eyes were on him last Saturday during the semi-final against Switzerland when the game went to a penalty shootout. Mr. Saka scored his shot with ease and England went on to win the shootout.\n\n\"I think for me, it's something I embrace,\" Mr. Saka said after that game. \"You can fail once but you have a choice whether you put yourself in that position again and I'm a guy who is going to put myself in that position.\"\n\nDavid Olusoga, a professor of public history at the University of Manchester, said an England victory would be similar to when the team won the 1966 World Cup. \"This is all about timing, it comes at the end of a moment of chaos and political discord in the country with a new government,\" Dr. Olusoga told the BBC on Thursday.\n\nHe also credited Mr. Southgate for standing up to the racists who went after Mr. Saka and the others. \"I think his leadership has been not just on the pitch, it's been trying to build a new workable version of English identity.\"\n\nWhile England fans will be desperate to celebrate their first major title since 1966, Spain is no stranger to championships. They've won the European title three times and at this tournament they defeated powerhouses France and Germany by the same 2-1 score in the semi-finals and quarter-finals respectively.\n\nOddsmakers

So it shows the more modern England way,\" said a beaming Southgate afterwards.\n\nThe ultimate test lies ahead against a Spain side that have swept all before them, including Germany and France on the tougher side of the draw.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Agence

But it's a results business.\n\nGermany, Italy, France, Portugal and of course Holland would love to be where we are.\n\nPeople will say we're lucky because we're on this side of the draw.\n\nAnd if we can reproduce the first-half performance over a whole game, we could even win it.\n\nEngland showed their usual character by coming back from a goal down for the third game in a row.\n\nBut the quality and intent after the shaky start was so much better.\n\nWe were on the front foot, playing through the lines, taking risks. We had longer spells than the Dutch.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nWe needed to keep up the energy, the pressing and the counter-pressing.\n\nWe have relied a lot on big moments from individuals, rather than complete performances, and there was another one. Of course, it will be a disappointment if we don't go on to win it now.\n\nBut whatever happens, Gareth has done a fantastic job.\n\nHe's already the second most successful England manager.\n\nWe have had some top coaches, so that is huge credit to him.\n\nHis record speaks for itself. We've got to two finals, a semi-final and a quarter-final.\n\nWe've won loads of knockout games, which we struggled to do for a while.\n\nHe's changed the whole way the country looks at penalties.\n\nWe used to dread it. Now I look at it before the game and think, 'If it goes to penalties, we're going to win'.\n\nIt's not just Gareth, either, it's the work of lots of coaches and staff, and the FA, who have changed things around.\n\nWe're producing players who can look after the ball now, helped by their club managers.\n\nIn the past, there was expectation on an England team but it wasn't really backed up.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we had good players and should have done better than we did. But you're still going to play against top top players.\n\nNow the expectation is based on a track record. Four major tournaments, four times quarter-finals or better.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I remember thinking: 'If we get to the semis, it's OK.' Then it maybe became \u00adquarter-finals.\n\nLooking at it from the outside as a fan, you look at it now and think: 'If we don't get to the final, is it failure?'\n\nI'm not sure about that, but that is a compliment to Gareth. He's created the feeling that we have to win something.\n\nFrom where we were when we lost to Iceland at Euro 2016 to where we are now is an amazing transformation.\n\n2016 felt like the end of an era. The country needed someone like a Gareth Southgate to give young players a chance, to put processes in place, to lead.\n\nJust as importantly, he and his staff have changed the culture around England.\n\nCulture is so important in football, but especially at international level. You don't get much time together, so when you do, it's about creating an environment that everyone wants to be in.\n\nIn the past there were stories about players not wanting to go, it not being a nice place to be.\n\nIt's not like that now. Young players are brought in and Gareth beds them in, they feel part of it.\n\nThere was a disconnect between the players and the fans, and the players and the media.\n\nWhen England play they represent me, and everyone English. We should be together. Gareth has done such a good job on that, starting at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\nThere is always going to be expectation and high pressure around the \u00adnational team. But we've got a group of players who know how to manage it and a culture that understands it.\n\nGareth and his coaches won't have been happy with some of the performances.\n\nBut I did like the way Gareth and his team have dealt with it.\n\nThere was no panic coming out of the camp.\n\nEveryone gave the same message: 'We know we can better, but we're here still.'\n\nAnd on Sunday they will be in \u00adBerlin to play Spain.\n\nThey will probably have to produce two halves of football as good as the first against Holland to beat them.\n\nWe have improved as the tournament has gone on and that is how you win things.\n\nIf Gareth can lead England to that major trophy we've all been waiting for, it will be the perfect answer to the critics and a brilliant day for us all.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/newspress-collage-hjpcez622-1720648379387.jpg?1720651999&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719152", "eventUri": "eng-9719152", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Well, talkSPORT has run the rule over several candidates who could pick up the baton should Southgate not renew his FA contract.\n\nThe FA have reportedly considered Carsley, and he's certainly the safe option.\n\nThe ex-midfielder brings an air of familiarity with him. Already integrated into England's system, he understands The FA's inner workings and would be able to slot into the job relatively seamlessly.\n\nVictory at the European Under-21 Championship last year demonstrated his ability to deliver silverware - albeit on a less significant scale - and it's feasible to assume The FA may repeat its previous strategy that saw Southgate himself promoted from U21 duties back in 2016.\n\nAs they did with Southgate, though, concerns will inevitably revolve around Carsley's pedigree at senior level football.\n\nStints as caretaker manager at Coventry, Brentford, and Birmingham doesn't exactly scream leading candidate, but his body of work with England's next generation may well be enough to convince the powers that be to overlook this.\n\nIn the eyes of many, this is the dream appointment. Guardiola has revolutionised English football, winning the first treble on these shores since Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United did it in 1999. His utter dominance over the European game for the last decade and a half is indisputable.\n\nBut before we get carried away with the idea, there are two big questions that need answering: one, would someone of Guardiola's stature even be interested in the job, and two, would The FA be happy to concede the level of operational control he'd demand over England's entire framework?\n\nFor the past seven years, Manchester City have created an environment perfectly suited to Guardiola's every need, from the personnel at board level, to the profile of signings made, to the setup of the academy and training facilities.\n\nIt's hard to envisage The FA offering this same level of flexibility, although it's surely something seriously worth considering if he expresses any form of interest.\n\nIt would be some coup for England. A serial winner at the apex of his powers, coaching a young, vibrant, and wildly talented England squad as they head stateside for the 2026 World Cup. For now, it remains a pipe dream.\n\nRegarded by many as the best English manager around, Howe has taken his career to new heights since being appointed Newcastle boss in 2021, even earning the backing of former England manager Glenn Hoddle to become the next Three Lions boss.\n\nKnown for his pleasing-on-the-eye playing philosophy, Howe has blended this with a more defensively resolute and physical game, helping the Geordies to Champions League qualification for the first time since the 2002/03 season.\n\nHe's certainly proved his critics wrong with what he's achieved at Newcastle, but whether he'd be willing to step away from the project remains a bit of an unknown.\n\nSimilar to others on this list, his ability to deliver silverware would also be questioned. A solitary Championship title back in 2015 won't be enough to convince the doubters of his credentials, and it's plausible that The FA may well bide their time over approaching Howe, intently watching how the next few years of his career play out from afar before looking to bring him into the England fold later down the line.\n\nSince being dismissed by Chelsea in April 2023, Potter's next career move has been a hot topic of debate. But having flirted with a return to Brighton alongside contract discussions with Leicester and Ajax twice, it's starting to feel like he's holding out for England.\n\nOne thing Potter would offer the Three Lions is fostering the type of wholesome playing environment Southgate has become known for.\n\nHis work in Sweden was all about character building, ensuring his team had a broader perspective on the local community than simply pulling on the club shirt every week.\n\nAnd it's not all trust exercises and positive vibes, either. Potter is an astute tactician who's renowned for his modern approach to the game, playing out from the back and looking to dominate possession.\n\nAs with others, though, a lack of historical success will be a blemish against his name.\n\nNot only has Potter won just one notable trophy in his career to date - the Swedish Cup - he also visibly struggled to deal with the pressure, expectations, and demands of an elite club when taking the reins at Chelsea.\n\nIf The FA is after someone with a proven track record of delivering international success, and who's familiar with the way the association operates, then Weigman's name is surely near the top of the candidate list.\n\nHaving won back-to-back European Championships with her native Netherlands and England Women respectively, Weigman knows what it takes to perform and deliver on the grandest stage. She's previously been likened to Southgate, too, conducting herself with the utmost professionalism.\n\nThe counter argument, of course, is whether this success can translate across to the men's game. There are similarities (despite whatever hot take Joey Barton comes out with to generate interest in his podcast) but clearly it would represent a different challenge.\n\nEmma Hayes, prior to taking the U.S. Women's National Team job, was regularly touted for a top men's managerial role, and it feels inevitable that this ground will be broken in the not-so-distant future. Whether Weigman will be that trailblazer remains to be seen.\n\nThe Special One. Mourinho's storied history in football management dates back some 23 years, having started out as Sir Bobby Robson's translator at Barcelona before catapulting himself to European prominence by shocking the world to win the 2004 Champions League with Porto.\n\nNever too far from the limelight, Mourinho has danced between managerial royalty and toxic destruction his entire career. And while he's never managed at international level, his history in the Premier League makes him a popular yet polarising figure among England fans.\n\nHaving recently taking the reins at Fenerbah\u00e7e in Turkey, this does feel more unrealistic, but rumours of a clause in his contract that allows him to leave for the Portugal job does indicate it's more unlikely than impossible.\n\nThere are question marks over whether The FA being would be willing to appoint such an outlandish character - ostensibly worried about rocking the apple cart - but Mourinho is undoubtedly box office.\n\nHis tenure would likely end in either World Cup glory or all out warfare.\n\nThe youngest and most inexperienced name on this list, O'Neil's managerial career is still in its infancy. That said, it's testament to the job he's done thus far that he's even been mentioned in this kind of debate.\n\nWhen he assumed caretaker control of Bournemouth in August 2022, many expected his days at the helm to be numbered. A subsequent brilliant run of form put paid to that idea, as O'Neil was named the new permanent manager, duly steering The Cherries to Premier League survival.\n\nHis shock sacking that summer has since led his career to Wolves, where he's continued to impress and earn many plaudits for combining a down-to-earth demeanour with progressive tactical ideals.\n\nA headline slot at his nation's top international gig may be a step too far at this stage, but O'Neil is showing all the right signs of being someone who's name is thrown into the ring every time the position becomes available over the next few years.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person",
